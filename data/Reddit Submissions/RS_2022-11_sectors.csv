personalfinance,Scared new home is just too expensive. Is it?,"We have a baby and NEED to move from our tiny apartment. We’ve been looking for a year but have faced a very tight market and, short story, it’s sucked really bad. Now interest rates are high and it’s depressing. 

We found a nice townhouse and I’m wondering if we can afford it. It’s $680k, which in our market, with the HOA, equates to about $5000/mo if we put 20% down.

We make 210k a year. I’ve been told I would get a raise which would bring that to 240k shortly, but that’s not in writing and I don’t want to count chickens. We have about $200k in savings.

Is this a reasonable cost considering our income? Unfortunately it feels like everything these days is this expensive or else has major flaws.",finance,1667265891
CryptoCurrency,Federal Reserve Tether Aquisution,"It seems like a long shot, but the way I see it, there’s pros and cons to using Tether as a turn key Central Bank Digital Currency. 
The biggest thing against it is protectionism, that there’s probably large corporations who’d like to get paid to develop an in house CBDC, and keep the money in the Military Industrial Complex.
However it’s been in use for a while, and is quite popular, even though pretty much everyone is certain it’s not 100% backed, kind of like real USD.
How much would Tether cost for the Federal Reserve system to purchase? I’m guessing it’s not as simple as market capitalization, $69 billion for a token, and would the price include the transfer of the backing USD?
Also is there any reason CBDC would need it’s own chain rather than being a token?",cryptocurrency,1667266420
investing,What happens to bank deposits when people can earn more on alternatives?,"Retail deposits serve as the cheapest way for banks to meet minimum reserve requirements. 

For years, banks have been fine offering near-0% rates on savings accounts because the alternatives offered only marginally better rates. Banks could meet reserve requirements cheaply through retail deposits and earn a fat margin on money creation through lending. 

But now that customers have more secure alternatives offering better interest rates, such as treasuries and money market funds, is there a risk that banks start experiencing withdrawals of deposits? 

Banks hold roughly $2 trillion in customer deposits, and they’re still offering them roughly 0%. The 3 month treasury offers nearly 4% apy with Money Market Funds offering over 3%. 

What happens when banks lose their cheapest means of meeting reserve requirements? Does it stop at margin pressure, when they need to borrow from the fed at higher rates? Or could we see a full-blown liquidity crisis like what happened in 2019?",finance,1667267195
stocks,Why October's stock market rally is 'on shaky ground',"The [stock market](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/stock-market-news-live-updates-october-31-2022-112227074.html) may have come on too hard, too fast in October given the negative news facing investors into year end.

""We believe the October rally in risk assets is really on shaky ground because markets previously were looking for a dovish pivot from the Fed and then they were looking for a pause from the Fed,"" BlackRock Chief Investment Strategist [Wei Li said on Yahoo Finance Live](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/video/china-faces-structural-headwinds-growth-142652024.html) . ""So it feels like markets want to see some positive development in terms of a dovish message from the Fed. But really we are not at that juncture yet because if you look at core inflation, it's still very, very sticky.""

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 14% in October, on track to notch its best performance since 1976. Gains for the Dow have been rather broad-based — including an 18% increase for JP Morgan and a 13% pop for [McDonald's](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-season-stories-morning-brief-090040849.html) — while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are up 7.5% and 2.5% on the month, respectively.

 

These gains have come despite the threat of even higher interest rates and a subpar earnings season (see warnings from Amazon and Meta). And BlackRock's Li thinks the returning enthusiasm for stocks will be met with a test out of the gate in November, notably from more hawkish commentary from the Federal Reserve at its latest policy meeting this week.

""We believe that rates will continue rising,"" Li explained. ""It will peak at 5%. And not too understate it, that's a very, very restrictive territory. In fact, where we are now, at 3.25%, is already restrictive to the economy. So our belief is that in this current supply-constrained environment, the Fed is going to have to engineer a recession in order to bring down inflation. Our assessment is that if they were to want to bring down inflation to 2% reasonably quickly, it represents a 2% shock to the U.S. economy in 2023. It also represents 3 million additional people out of a job, pushing unemployment rate to 5%.""",finance,1667268020

&gt;A 29-year-old man died Friday morning after being swept away by sea currents on the beach behind Ashford Hospital in County, the Police Bureau said.

&gt;According to a police report, the incident was reported at 9:15 a.m. when authorities were alerted that the man, identified as Nicolai Arcadie Muchgian, had been dragged.

&gt;Rescue personnel managed to rescue his body that no longer showed vital signs, it was reported. 

&gt;According to the authorities, the injured party was a resident of San Juan.

I'm new to bonds - fairly seasoned in investing.

\- Being that Value and Yield and inversely related, could a bond selling now at 84/100 reevaluate itself to 100/100 or more before maturity if Interest Rates decline? If yes, will it be easy to sell or will it probably never meet any Ask side?

stocks,How Congress and corporations can help stop inflation,"Americans look to the country's most powerful bank, the Federal Reserve, to combat inflation.

""I think our biggest problem, at least for the foreseeable future, is high inflation,"" Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, told CNBC.

The Fed can raise interest rates to slow inflation, which ultimately makes the cost of borrowing higher for everyday Americans, and that can be just as painful as inflation.

""The big question mark is how quickly will inflation come under control?"" Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, told CNBC.

The central bank already raised interest rates five times in 2022, and there are more rate hikes on the way.

But the Federal Reserve does not have to take on the battle alone.

Fiscal policy enacted by Congress and power wielded by big business can help fight rising costs.

""Congress has much more targeted tools,"" Claudia Sahm, former Fed economist, told CNBC. ""It's about making the system work more effectively, so all these costs don't get piled up on individuals.""

For example, the Biden administration passed the Inflation Reduction Act. This $739 billion sweeping tax, health and climate bill aims to reshape the U.S. economy.

""Taxpayers eventually have to pay for them, but they can release a lot of pressure on families and businesses that are trying to pay the bills,"" Sahm said.

Then there's the private sector's power. As people started expecting higher prices, some are arguing that companies are taking advantage of expectations and increasing prices even further than is necessary.

According to the New York Fed, the more inflation an industry saw, the more gross profits increased.

Now, most U.S. companies are recording their largest profits since 1950, at least over the last [two quarters](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-30/fattest-profits-since-1950-debunk-inflation-story-spun-by-ceos), according to [OMFIF](https://www.omfif.org/2022/06/corporate-us-making-consumers-pay-for-inflation/).",finance,1667303354
stocks,"CNBC Pro JPMorgan upgrades Carvana, says investors have a better handle on risks","Carvana and its investors seem to be getting a hold of the company’s troubles, according to JPMorgan.

Analyst Rajat Gupta upgraded shares of [Carvana](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/CVNA/) to neutral from underweight, saying that investors have a better handle on the risks around the used car seller after its decline this year, and that the company can better manage its liquidity.

“Our conversations with investors continue to suggest a high degree of skepticism around CVNA’s ability to fund the FCF burn through 2024, given elusive volume growth (hurts fixed cost leverage), skepticism around real estate liquidity and risks to finance GPU from widening Auto ABS spreads,” Gupta wrote in a Tuesday note.

“Importantly, as we highlighted in our preview, carve-outs in their debt indentures allow for an additional \~$4bn+ of debt which can be borrowed on a secured basis. Clearly, these are not ideal outcomes and will be very expensive, but any progress demonstrated on tapping even a slice of the $2 bn in real estate, could temporarily shun concerns around liquidity and thus, survivability,” he added.

The analyst maintained his December 2022 price target of $20, which is roughly 48% upside from Monday’s closing price of $13.53. The stock jumped 9% in Tuesday premarket trading.

Carvana shares down more than 90% this year, and Gupta expects that the retailer is “not out of the woods” yet as it deals with rising interest rates and a poor macro backdrop for used car sales. He said he does not see a V-shaped recovery in the industry.

Still, Carvana will not deal with the same level of write-down risk like some of its peers such as CarMax, he said in the note.",finance,1667303876

personalfinance,Trying to save finances in 30s,"Hello everyone,

Myself and my wife (early 30s) have not had the best financial experience during our time together, and the alarm bells have really been going off lately due to inflation etc. We have 3 kids under 5 ($$$$$), my wife has taken 2 years off work which has of course crushed us financially to the point where we had to withdraw a sizable portion of our 401k and move back home with the mother in law (very lucky honestly).

My wife finally returns to work this month which has really put the onus on us to start saving. We have under 10k at the moment in savings with only a 300 a month student loan payment our debt (we own our two cars). After she returns to work our combined income will be about 125k before taxes. She will have little room to increase her pay but over the next few years I should be able to move up in my company enough to push that up a little.

Currently we are paying 1,200 a month to the mother in law; we are trying to budget a large amount to save in the next 12 months so we can move out etc, but with current interest rates it feels like getting our own home seems so unlikely. 

We are both incredibly anxious about our situation as we know not having any large savings by now is a real blow (so please try not to be critical of our situation in the comments), we just have never had the chance to both have decent incomes until now. And with cost of living rising so fast it feels impossible to get ahead from here.

Any advice for our situation? We're trying to sit down and budget but with young kids it feels impossible. We've started to cut back a ton on anything for ourselves so we hope that can make a difference in the long run.

There are many traders who are paying top dollar to Borrow BCH and play the markets (gamble basically). They either make way more than their interest rate, or lose way more.

If you dont know how to play the markets, you can take the safer option and lend for interest, to Genesis through Coinbase earn for 5.5% (5.33% daily interest, cumulatively is actually 5.5% if you dont withdraw your earnings)

Pros: Easy to withdraw. Daily interest. Very liquid.

This is because for now they are not allowing the BCH to be withdrawn, they are trying to convert it to an ETF which would allow withdrawals, or they can simply enable withdrawals in the future if they choose to do so (Im not sure why they arent already).

This rate is 6 and a half times the yearly interest of Gemini earn. So if it becomes an ETF before 6.5 years you still get paid the full yield. 

Pros: 6.5 years of 5.5% locked in even if they allow withdrawals earlier, then you just take it out and lend it somewhere else for more interest. Rates cant drop because its locked in.

Cons: to withdraw your profits, they have to either become an ETF, or enable withdrawals, or the market price has to reach parity with spot.

personalfinance,"Received windfall, should we payoff our mortgage?","Greetings, thank you for reading my post, I appreciate what you have to say.

We purchased our home in 2015 for $240k. After a $60k down payment and 7 years of payments, there is $143k remaining on the mortgage loan. Mortgage interest rate is 4.125%. After punching in the numbers to an amortization calculator, we will pay another $114k in interest over the next 23 years.

I sold my stake in my company in March 2022 for $450k. 2022 tax bill is expected to be around $50k (we had a $75k loss on a sale of a commercial property), so let's say $400k take-home.

Should we set the mortgage to $0 to save on interest? It would also free up $1500/mo in cash flow. I like the idea of no debt and more cash flow, as it would reduce my stress level on finances, and provide additional breathing room for investment and a less rigid lifestyle. But there is the lost opportunity cost of investing $143k in cash today.

We are open to other ideas, like using the collateral on our current home and the cash on hand for a down payment on a rental property. We could also continue as normal, and invest the bulk cash into an index fund.

Looking forward to any insight or ideas you may have to offer. Thank you.",finance,1667322214

personalfinance,Scammer stole my credit card info and pretended to be me,"I have two bank accounts: one in my current state where I have a debit card, and a one in FL where I have both a debit and a credit card. 

On Friday (10/28/2022) I got a call from my FL bank saying someone was calling pretending to be me (from a spoofed number) saying ""I"" was travelling and needed a travel alert on my credit card. The teller said this person sounded older and had a ""Caribbean"" accent.  I told them that the person calling was not me. They had also put my card info on their Samsung Pay. No one I know has a Samsung.

The bank froze and deactivated both my credit and debit cards, and I put a credit freeze on my stuff with the Big Three credit places. I ran both Avast and Malwarebytes scans on my phone and found no malware or viruses.

On Monday I completely restructured my mobile banking app. Password, security questions, a PIN number. I even put a pin on my voicemail.

Today (11/1/2022) I found out the scammer called my bank again yesterday, trying to disguise their voice to sound younger. The teller on the phone got rough with them, saying ""You're not [Stunning], stop trying to be [Stunning], you should be in jail"".

I have no idea how this happened. I went to Italy over the summer on a class trip, and I only used my credit card once or twice, both at legit, established businesses in Florence. 
Before I left for my trip, I removed my banking apps from my phone and cleared my browser history/cache.

The only other issue I can think of is the fact I put my card info on Google Pay a year or so ago and I never bothered to remove it.

My bank will be sending me a new credit and debit card soon, but I am worried the Scammer won't give up, will keep calling my bank trying to be me, and will still try and keep using my dead credit card.

I'm currently $40,000 in debt. I won't get into specifics but I have more money going out than I do going in right now. As a result of this, I've unfortunately fallen behind on payments just so I can keep a roof over my head and now I'm being forced to default on some of my loans by creditors within the next few days. With that said, I'm trying to figure out what my options are. I've come up with two ideas that I'd like to run by this community and if anybody else has other ideas, I'd like to hear about them.

My first idea is to sell my car. I still owe $18,000 on it and if I were to sell it I would break even. I'd like to then purchase another vehicle that I can commute with for around $4,000-$7,000. My only concern is my credit score is about 500 and once these loans go into default, it'll likely impact that score even more. So I'm not sure I would even be able to finance a vehicle right now considering nobody would provide me with a loan given my poor credit. I also can't just purchase a vehicle in full because again, I'm losing more money than I make so I can't even save up for it. Selling my car is the only expense I can get rid of as the other expenses I have is my apt lease which I'm still locked in at, and the numerous loans from different creditors which I also can't just drop.

My other idea is to consider bankruptcy. I don't know much about this concept to be honest, but I believe based on what I do know is that regardless of the the impact this would have on me, I'll at least  be making money again and have room to breathe without succumbing to ridiculous interest rates...

I'm more than happy to provide more information if requested, but I feel as though this simplifies my situation best without writing an essay. Thank you in advance.",finance,1667332554

personalfinance,"How to best finance a house, if at all? Looking for advice.","Hello,

I need some help with my finances.

Current situation:

* 2 adults + 2 toddlers, dual income, total net 18k / month. Our jobs are reasonably stable.
* Expense monthly: 3k mortgage (townhouse, 2.1% interest rate), 3k daycare, additional 6k all other stuff (utilities, food, gas, insurances, hobbies, clothes/diapers for the kids, babysitting when they are sick and we need to work, …). The total cash outflow each month is 12k.
* We do not dine out too much (bar occasional chick-fil-a, chipotle, …), have the cheapest phone plans, and drive cars that are &lt;$30k, in general, we are rather frugal.

We like our 1,500 sq ft townhouse, it is quite convenient, it has sufficient parking, but it is not an ideal place for a family – we would like to have our own yard and more room. We bought it before the pandemic to own a place, not rent. We did not have kids at that point. It was a great financial deal. That interest rate is quite unbelievable (15-year mortgage + some points).

As the twin toddlers are now becoming more manageable (2 years of age), we are thinking about adding a third kid. For that, we would like to live in an actual house with more bedrooms and larger square footage (but below 4k sq ft, we do not fancy a mansion). The kids would appreciate a garden and a bit more space as they run around endlessly these days.

There is a nice area with good schools and reasonable house prices – say 800k. By the time we could move, we should have \~250k cash on hand. This would leave us with 550k to borrow at 7+ %.

The question is: how to best finance the potential purchase? As you can see, we have \~6k positive cash flow each month. The new mortgage would likely be around 5k. Another kid would easily consume the rest, so we would be teetering on the edge. However, this is predicated on not selling/renting the townhouse. Once all moved, I would rent out the townhouse. Since I am not that familiar with being a landlord, I am not sure about this option just yet. Nevertheless, even if rented out, we could fetch \~2.5k/mo, so the cash flow from the townhouse would be negative, though this would bring us back to saving a few grand a month. These are the financing options I am thinking about:

* Just use cash: 250k + 550k loan.
* Cash + HELOC on the townhouse: \~350k + 450k loan.
* Use less cash and have more buffer: 160k (20%) + 640k loan.
* Maybe there is a better alternative?

The townhouse we live in could work for the next few years, it would be cramped and not exactly what we would want in the long run, but it could work. I realize our situation is quite nice, so thank you for your time and positive thoughts.",finance,1667334375

Basically, they and virtually everywhere I'm seeing thinks the fed isn't going to pivot. And this also means  there is a STRONG chance prices will melt down later this year. 

Looking at BTC charts it lines up showing it could go down to $15k, but we are honestly in an unknown. 

Any case, we are seeing countries like Japan they are trying to save the yen as it free falls, and same with many other countries. A good article on this is [https://www.thedailyupside.com/japan-spent-over-40-billion-propping-up-the-yen-in-october/](https://www.thedailyupside.com/japan-spent-over-40-billion-propping-up-the-yen-in-october/)

Word is like when the U.S. Federal Reserve using Liquidity Swaps to send almost $10B to Switzerland to bail them out so they don't sell US bonds/debt. We might see the US try to bailout Japan and several other countries (btw that money is coming out of future taxes. Like it use to come from countries and investors buying bonds. But countries are running out of money, and investors are mostly tapped out. Which leaves taxes to pay for it.)

TLDR in a few months expect shit to hit the fan if the US fed doesn't pivot. If it does pivot then expect the opposite, but they are making the problem far worse for future us.

But based on charts, companies like Blackrock, etc. If the fed doesn't pivot expect it to take a good year to 2 years before we are on the same level as we are now economically. During that time expect massive job losses, job creation stops, higher prices, and so on. This obviously will harm crypto to some degree. Most likely a bit.",cryptocurrency,1667336232

He has no income that can be touched. His federal retirement income is exempt. He has no equity in his home. I wouldn't lend him a dollar if not for my grandmother.

solar,Disconnect between the PV meter and load controller - does this block the usefulness of the Sunlight package from Enphase?,"I am getting solar installed and I am completely not happy with the installer and their poor service at this point. I was hoping to get an answer here to make sure they aren't trying to pull something over on me.

My utility company has rejected their plans saying their 3-line diagram doesn't include a disconnect between the PV meter and the load controller. I do not know what this means and I'm not getting a straight answer from the installers.

I opted for the Enphase Sunlight package that allows the energy from the panels to be fed directly to the house without a battery in place and even if the normal power grid goes down. So essentially you can bypass dumping your solar into the grid and power your own house. If you have an answer to this question, then you already know about this system/option.

I asked if the power company would allow that system in place because it basically bypasses their crappy energy buy-back of 1:4. I was told it was fine.

Now the plans are rejected because there is no disconnect between the PV meter and the load controller. Does this have anything to do with this option? Are they saying that the system can't bypass the dump into the grid and go directly into the home?

Any information would be appreciated. Thank you.

devops,"Idea for ""Security Platform in a Box"" for School Districts - Looking for feedback","Greetings r/devops

This may not be entirely appropriate for this sub, so let me apologize in advance if I've crossed some line, but the skill set and way of thinking in this sub is exactly what I'm after. 

I'm in a devops role now, and have been in cyber security for over 20 years now. I'm doing some volunteer work through my company, working with a local school district on helping them to improve their security posture,  making sure they are taking appropriate precautions to help protect against things like ransomware etc....

In talking to the 2 guys who oversee IT (Security, IT, Databases, Sysadmin etc) for the whole district, they are flat out overwhelmed, under staffed, and their budget doesn't have nearly what it needs to really do this. They don't have simple things like MFA setup, or even a SIEM for their logs. They know they need it, but just can't get the staff/money/whatever to pull it off. 

Being a big fan of working at scale, automation, and open source, my brain has been grinding away on this for a week or two now, and it seems to me that there could be an entirely free and automated ""security platform in a box"" solution for all of the other school districts that find themselves in this position. It can/should be as easy as clicking the proverbial ""button"" and having everything take off. 

* Spin up VMs/containers (Proxmox, AWS, VMWare, GCP, Azure etc) using something like Terraform
* Setup open source tools for things like MFA, Log Collection, VPNs, vulnerability scanning, inventory management (physical assets and software installed on them), LDAP etc...
* Use something like Ansible to configure all of their existing servers to ensure an appropriate baseline based on the CIS controls. You could also use Ansible to help configure teacher and student laptops/desktops. 
* Setup Student Information Systems, teacher grade book apps etc, assuming there are open source options out there, or integrate with whatever the big players are now, if need be. 
* Internal document storage/wiki for things like incident response plans
* Internal ticketing type system for things like reporting security incidents
* And whatever else I haven't thought of yet. 

Such an undertaking would be a huge effort, but after talking to these guys for a few weeks now, it feels like there could be a need. If we (the greater open source community) can come up with something that solves this for one school district, it could help thousands of others. 

I'm curious if anyone else has experience related to anything like this, or maybe just looking for people to tell me it's a dumb idea or waste of time, before I doodle anything further in my notebook...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, thanks in advance for your time, and my apologies again if this really wasn't appropriate for r/devops, but when I think about people who are passionate and knowledgable about all things automation, deployment, sysadmin etc....this group comes to mind.",technology,1667343806
economy,Job openings surged in September despite Fed efforts to cool labor market,"[Link to the full article (2 min read)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/jolts-september-2022.html) The recent JOLTS report shows that job openings continued to surge in September and were at 10.72 million, well above the estimate of 9.85 million. It means that there are about 1.9 job openings for every available worker. The disparity has fueled the increase in wages and the employment cost index. As the Fed watches JOLTS report closely for indication of the labor market, it is unlikely they will pivot from the 0.75% rate hike decision on Wednesday. However, a positive news is that the ISM manufacturing data in September are showing signs of weakened inflation.

personalfinance,Balance Transfer Advice,"I am looking for some advice on a balance transfer with some underlying issues associated with it. To break down current debt and cards - 

I currently have outstanding balances totaling around $10,300 -

Apple Card - $4,094.04

Amex Gold - $4,432.38

Discover IT (Student card I believe) - 1,740.08

I am looking into doing a balance transfer of all three balances to a balance transfer card with the introductory 0% APR period so I can work to knock some of that debt down without paying the high interest rates between cards, and have one solid balance I can work to pay off rather than having to go back and forth between the three card balances every month. I have read conflicting reports that both Amex and Apple cards don’t accept balance transfers, but seems like there’s some way around it with things like balance transfer checks? My current FICO credit score is around 700, but I haven’t applied for any other card, which I’m hoping someone could offer some advice on if there is a card out there that I can apply for that would offer me the opportunity to transfer all three balances to open card with a 0% APR Intro fee. Thinking broadly and assuming I would be approved for a card and the entirety of the balance (10,000ish) - Does anyone have any advice or have a card on the top of their mind I can apply for to tackle this situation?

stocks,CNBC Pro This contrarian indicator from Bank of America signals a 94% chance stocks are higher a year from now,"Sentiment on Wall Street has gotten so bad that strategists have finally started to throw in the towel, and that could trigger a reliable buy signal from Bank of America.

The Bank of America Merrill Lynch Sell Side Indicator, based on a survey of Wall Street strategists’ asset allocation recommendations, has reached its lowest level since early 2017. The bank said historically, when the indicator was at current levels or lower, subsequent 12-month [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) returns were positive 94% of the time and the median 12-month return was 22% higher.

“Equity sentiment resumes its descent toward a ‘Buy’ signal,” Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities’ head of U.S. equity and quantitative strategy, said in a note. “We have found that Wall Street’s consensus equity allocation has historically been a reliable contrarian indicator.”

📷

The indicator simply measures how the biggest portfolio managers are positioned. Bank of America said a range of 60% to 65% represents the traditional “normal” equity allocation for a balanced fund. The 2008 financial crisis pushed the indicator below that range for the first time since 2000.

Currently, that level stands at 52.8% in October after sliding 6 percentage points this year.

Bank of America said strategists started to recommend an increased allocation to bonds as yields continued to rise.

“The rising debate over whether bonds now look more attractive than stocks marks a departure from the post-GFC era when TINA (‘There is No Alternative’ to stocks) was the prevailing argument,” Subramanian said.

The stock market has been on a roller-coaster ride this year as the Federal Reserve rushed to raise interest rates aggressively to tame inflation. The central bank is widely expected to hike rates by 75 basis points on Wednesday for a fourth consecutive time. The [S&amp;P 500](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/.SPX/) is down more than 19% this year.

To be sure, the Sell Side Indicator is only one of the five metrics Bank of America takes into account for its official market forecast. The bank sees the S&amp;P 500 ending the year at 3,600, about 6% lower from where it trades now.",finance,1667356272

Forex,The McGinley Dynamic Indicator! Hardly used but is way better than EMA,"It's actually not a moving average but rather a smoothing mechanism for price action. It minimizes price separation, price whipsaws and it will hug the price action more closely. The dynamic line speeds up in down markets but it will move more slowly in up markets. Since it stays in line with price action it greatly avoids whipsaws, fast or slow.

I set it up on my charts in a fibonacci sequence and what I notice is that the price will bounce off certian key levels in a up or down trend. Even if price looks like it is in a whipsaw it will still point you in the right direction of the trend, unlike EMA which can give false trend reversal breakouts. If price does break the dynamic lines I know that there will be a trend reversal due to how the dynamic line follows price action more closely. 

It was actually developed for the financial markets and it has been the best tool in my toolbox. Used with Pivot points it can be very powerful and accurate. Of course news can alter the path in some ways but unless its really big news (like interest rate decisions) the dynamic will still tell you if it will continue with the trend. 

Just figured I'd tell you guys about this powerful tool because they call it ""The best unknown indicator"" for a reason 🙂",finance,1667370069

However, the pair currently looks like it’s trying to hold support at the former channel’s upper trendline, and given that a lot of the move lower has stemmed from the US Dollar’s unrelenting strength, today’s FOMC Meeting could be key for near-term direction. 

While another 75bps move is widely expected, any signal on the possibility of rate hikes slowing next month could trigger a broader, sustained pullback in the Dollar, and as a result, help EUR/USD bounce to retest another break back above parity. 

But of course, all trading carries risk, and after yesterday’s JOLTS report already saw some traders scale back bets on a potential pivot, the Fed may maintain their hawkish stance and cause EUR/USD to begin a yet another leg lower. 

Either way, it will be interesting to see how this pair trades leading up to, and after, the FOMC.",finance,1667378954

Go to get pre-approved, all is well, they appreciated how prepared I was. Got a nice $160k which in my mind was plenty. Until started looking.

Bitcoin,Keynesianism doesn't work in the real world.,"This is from the Market Wizards book (Jack Schwager,1988). The author interviews Richard Dennis, one of the most succsessful traders ever. He was one of the few relevant democrats in the investment sector, a world that was dominated by republicans, and he was heavily intellectually invested in politics. This was written more than 30 years ago and it feels more relevant than ever.

&amp;#x200B;

**As a long-time market observer, what major trends do you see shaping up over the coming years?**

I bet we will be at record levels of inflation by the end of 1990. It is going to be driven by trying to avoid a deep recession. The recession is going to be caused by the federal budget deficit as investors require higher and higher levels of real interest rates to buy the debt. The' government will try to avoid the recession by stimulating the economy, a tactic which essentially doesn't work.

It is, unfortunately, a very Republican idea, but I think it is right. Whether you like it or not, the financial markets are in conservative hands. People who lend money to the government and business will not buy monetary easing as a solution to a recession.

**Are you implying that the deficit problem is just a time bomb, which will eventually shatter the economy?**

Sure. We tend to think that since it is not a problem now, that means it won't be. We expect continuity in our lives, but the economy, and certainly the markets, are more discontinuous than continuous.

It is like having termites in the foundation of your house. You may not notice them until one day they gnaw away a big chunk and the house collapses. I don't think anybody should take a large amount of comfort in the fact that things appear to be holding together.

**Hypothetically, if you were President and could influence change, would the deficit be the first thing you would change?**

Sure. I think it is especially important for Democrats, since they were the first ones to pick up the banner of Keynesianism \[the advocacy of government programs to increase employment\], to admit that while it may be a great theory, it doesn't work in the real world.

**I don't think Keynes ever proposed using deficit spending in strong economic times.**

No, that's true. He proposed surpluses that were supposed to be countercyclical to deficits. Surpluses in good times; deficits in bad times. The trouble is that we have only one side of that equation because of the lack of political will to create the surpluses when times are good. So what we really ought to do is admit that Keynesian economics is just an excuse for easy money, overspending, and overconsuming. We ought to just admit that the government is a debt junkie and the whole concept of deficit spending is flawed in practice.

**You mean Keynesianism as it is being applied, not Keynesian economics as he himself purported it?**

The theory is fine, it just doesn't work in the real world. Therefore, we shouldn't use it. Besides, Keynesian economics was a solution to the problem of oversaving and underconsumption, which was a fair enough attempt to pull us out of the Great Depression. The problem now is the exact opposite: undersaving and overconsumption. Even if Keynesianism were politically tenable, you still need a different solution because you have the exact opposite problem.

**Is there an economic theory that you feel fits the times and makes sense?**

We have to get rid of deficit spending. We need to retire the deficit in some orderly way, and the federal government should have to balance its budget just as the states do. At that point, Milton Friedman's proposal for a constant money supply adjusted by a growth factor would probably be a good idea.",cryptocurrency,1667386024

# [Dow futures inch lower ahead of key Fed policy decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Dow futures ticked lower Wednesday as investors await the Federal Reserve’s latest policy decision at the conclusion of its meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 20 points, or roughly 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures traded flat, while Nasdaq 100 futures inched 0.2% higher.
*****
&gt; The Fed is widely expected to announce a 0.75 percentage point rate increase, its fourth hike in a row of that size as it battles high inflation. Investors are also looking for a signal that the central bank is prepared to slow the pace of its rate-hiking plan come December.
*****
&gt; Comments from the Federal Reserve and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will play a key role in deciphering where stocks go in the months ahead and whether markets kick off a fresh bull run.
*****
&gt; “Continuation of the year-end rally is contingent on the Fed delivering on the pivot narrative,” wrote Barclays’ Emmanuel Cau in a note to clients Wednesday. “Peak hawkishness may fuel more FOMO, but should not be confused with dovishness, as CBs continue to walk a fine line. Rate cuts have been a precondition for equities to start a new bull market in the past - we’re not there yet.”
*****
&gt; The central bank’s decision will come after the release of mixed economic data on Tuesday.
*****
&gt; The ISM manufacturing index showed the share of companies reporting expansion in October come in slightly ahead of expectation, while the JOLTS report conveyed a strong labor market despite the Fed’s aggressive tightening clip.
*****
&gt; “That’s just not a great number for the Fed, it’s still a tight job market,” Victoria Greene, chief investment officer at G Squared Private Wealth told CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime” on Thursday. “So I think they’re still between a rock and a hard place. They’re going to have to hike. Nobody likes it. Everybody wants them to stop, but it’s like a car crash in slow motion. They just can’t stop hiking.”
*****
In other economic news, mortgage application data for last week came in flat despite a slight tick lower in rates. ADP’s employment report is also due out Wednesday.

personalfinance,"I bought and sold first and only stocks for exact same amount, +/- $0.01. How does it affect taxes? (US)","Hi guys, I searched but couldn't really find anything, just looking for some resources or direction to not get arrested for tax fraud (kidding but I am trying to get educated on gaps in my understanding).

TLDR I bought 3 of a stock on Cash App, 3 of the same stock on Fidelity, and then sold all 6 the next year at the exact same amount I paid for them within each service. Can't figure out what it means for tax szn.

In 2021, I thought I might try to learn or practice about investment in addition to my 401k. So I bought 3 stocks (3 total, all same ticker) on Cash App at various prices. It seemed simple enough and the money amount went up and down on different days like my 401k but without the needing to be 60+ years old or whatever. Ok.

A little later I made a separate Individual Account with Fidelity and loaded this with $600 or something, and also bought 3 of the exact same stock to keep it simple. I also bought 1 or 2 stocks of ""F"" for some reason which I still have, so no questions on that. Maybe I will hold them forever to avoid arrest.

The next year in 2022, I still wasn't gaining any intelligence and everything I read including pretty basic Fidelity education and Investopedia articles was just opening more wormholes of complications and US-based money confusion.

So, I set some limit price thing, and managed to sell the 3 Fidelity stocks within 0.01 of the exact total I paid for them. So +$0.0 basically overall.

Then, I managed to do the exact same thing to unload the 3 Cash App stocks at the exact same total I had put in. Another +$0.0 overall.

It may have been exact down to the cent on one service, and within 1 cent on the other. Can check, if it makes a difference.

Now it's towards the end of the year and I am v confused about what I will need to do differently on my taxes. I do my state &amp; federal taxes myself each year on freetaxusa. No home, yes 401k, yes HSA. No stock stuff before or other than this.

I guess I thought I would learn by doing, but just got more confused and decided to wait until the next calendar year to sell so I wouldn't have to figure it out during that first tax year.

Cluelessness level is HIGH. Been researching on and off for over a year to try and understand stocks as per tons of recommendations everywhere, and I still just don't get any of these terms and tax stuff and decided to not go any further and just sell and get away from this topic and stick with my 0.001% interest savings account. Baby language appreciated. (legal disclosure I am in 30's and not an actual kid trying to pull stuff) Thanks all.",finance,1667394981

personalfinance,"Trellis Financial Wellness survey, Texas universities","I attend a university based in Texas. Lately I've received multiple emails asking me to participate in a financial wellness survey and offering a $50 gift card to do so, from the company and urging emails from school officials. After looking up the company (trelliscompany.org), it appears they are responsible for collecting on federal student loans that go unpaid after 9 payments. Basically it looks like a collection agency that goes on your credit report after being sent to them. I did not participate in the survey because the whole thing seems ""off"" to me, particularly after doing some digging. All the school names that come up are Texas colleges and universities.

Questions: Is this financial wellness survey legitimate? Why are schools pushing so hard to get students to participate? Anything nefarious about this campaign that should be known?

personalfinance,Should I increase my student loan payoff rate at the cost of retirement savings?,"Background: I'm 26 with an income of ~$160k, but in a fairly high CoL area.

I have ~$45k left in student loans (down from ~$70k 3 years ago) at an interest rate of ~4.25%. I'm currently putting about $900/month towards them with an expected payoff timeline of 4.5 years.

I have ~$50k in my retirement account and am putting ~$1300/month plus my employer's maximum match of ~$400.

I'm interested in paying my loans off faster, mostly for the emotional win but also with the thought that I may like to buy a house in the next 5 years and would love to have no debt at that time. I could reallocate $500 each month currently going to retirement to my loans instead (while still maximizing employer match) and reduce my payoff timeline from 4.5 years to 3 years.

I am going to be getting a ring for my long time girlfriend, while also needing a new phone in the near future. So I'm thinking that while I can afford these both outright, why not take 0% interest financing and use the would-be spent money on student debt which will have an interest rate attached to it or put it into I-bonds/HYSA so that the money will grow and will, in the end, make the things I'm buying cheaper.

My thoughts, if I were to do this, are that debt is usually a priority from highest to lowest rates but that if I was to be laid off that the money should be saved somewhere I can access it in the future to keep paying these small financed items. Which paying down debt eliminates the possible future-use of that money.

Is not paying off these items right away a bad idea? is my thinking flawed on this?",finance,1667401505

personalfinance,What's the best way to invest a lump sum into CDs/Treasury Bonds given the uncertainty of interest rate increases/decreases?,"My dad is retired, and is not generating any income. He sold one house and has enough cash to pay off the mortgage (3.5% APY, 15 years remaining) on another house.

He doesn't want to pay off the mortgage. His reasoning is that because the market is down, he doesn't want to sell his retirement portfolio to fund his living expenses. He would rather draw down this cash pile now, at the cost of the 3.5% interest over time, and only sell from his retirement portfolio after the markets rebound. He also psychologically feels a lot more comfortable with a big pile of cash while the economy is going through this inflation/recession.

He also doesn't want to invest this cash into stocks. He is retired so he isn't generating any money and is very concerned about sequence of return risk. I know a lot of people here might say that now is the best time to buy stocks, but he won't risk it.

-------

I figure if he is going to keep this cash he might as well invest most of it in CDs or Treasury Bonds. I'm not really a fan of bond funds since the market value of a bond fund depends on how many people are buying and selling, whereas with a CD/Treasury you always receive your principal back in full if you hold to maturity. 

One issue I see is that this inevitably involves trying to time the market. The ideal case is to invest in shorter term bonds/CDs continually until you think interest rates have peaked, at which point you switch to investing in the longest yielding treasury bonds/CDs. Of course we have no idea when that is going to happen.

So what is a sensible investing strategy to move a lump sum of cash into CDs/Bonds, given that it's difficult to time the peaking of interest rates?

I figure you can take the remaining life of the loan, in my father's case 15 years, and then put some proportion of cash into different duration CDs/Treasuries. For example put 33% into cash, 33% into 1 year CD, and 33% into 2 year treasury bonds. Or 40% into cash, 20% into 3 year, 20% into 4 year, 20% into 5 year. etc.

personalfinance,sell or rent current place if I buy something bigger?,"Hello all, I know this has been asked many times, but still I come here for some advice. Every situation is unique so I want to give more info about mine.

Lately I have been thinking more and more about buying some smaller house with my partner. I am currently a sole owner of an apartment that I bought for 142K Euros. Currently, as the prices skyrocketed and the location is very good, I could probably sell it between 220-240K. At the moment I have 60K left on the mortgage with interest rate 0.5%. Yes you read that right. I have to clarify that I'm not from US, UK or any other major country, I come from a small CEE country where the average monthly brutto salary is around 1K so the interest rates are lower. In the area I live in, which is the richest, average is around 1.2K Euro I think.

However, now with the crisis and huge inflation, interest rates are between 3-4% which is incredibly high considering what an average person here makes. It is expected to rise even more, but god knows.

The houses in the areas I'm looking at are between 250-350K, depending how close to the capital city. I would prefer being as close as possible, but due to the prices, I can maybe settle for something a bit further.

I also spoke to my personal financial advisor who helped me tremendously when buying my current place and her opinion is to keep my current place.

But, on the other hand, she admitted, getting a mortgage for 350K is quite a lot and if I sell the place, I can pay 50% with the money I will have and my partner would take mortgage for the rest.

Both me and my partner are making decent money (again considering where we come from). I make around 30K yearly before taxes and my partner 36K so we could afford to pay even for 350K, monthly payment would be around 1800 Eur (30 years) depending on the interest rate.

BUT, with the current interest rates, it means that getting 350K is paying like half a million or even more! If I sell the place, I could use like 140-150K ( I would keep something to invest and of course you need money for furniture etc.) , my partner could chip in around 30K. If we wait, maybe even more, so we could have 200K on hand so if we would find something for around 300K, that means getting a mortgage for only 100K which is much better.

Then on the other hand, my current place is still relatively new, built in 2016, is in good location and the rental demand in the city is huge, because lot of people cannot afford mortgage ( you need at least 20% of your own money for a down payment) so they are forced to rent, which means landlords take advantage of that and the rent is crazy high. 

I could probably rent current place for around 700-800 Euros monthly. My current expenses including mortgage are around 350 Euro (mortgage is around 185 Euro). But after 2024, my 0.5% interest rate will be gone, so depending on what the offer will be, mortgage payment will for sure be higher.

It shouldn't be a problem to find tenants, one of my friends is renting a place and she told me she had so many messages when she posted it that it was insane. However, tenants can easily destroy things, create problems, not paying rent and just causing trouble. But it's a place in a capital city, good location and I could have something on hand if something goes wrong with my partner. Also I would still own that property which could rise in value even more, but I doubt it raises so much to cover the extra money that we would pay only in interest if we take 350K mortgage.

So I really have a big dilemma. For me personally, I think it makes more financial sense to sell, but I was never good at math haha and my financial advisor advises to keep, so I don't know what am I missing here?

Any input will be greatly appreciated",finance,1667408499

They include a top EPA official who reported purchases of oil and gas stocks and an FDA official who owned dozens of food and drug stocks on the agency’s no-buy list.

Our investigation showed how senior FTC officials traded more than those at any other major US agency [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-regulators-of-facebook-google-and-amazon-also-invest-in-the-companies-stocks-11665670207), how dozens of federal officials reported frequent trades –in one case, 9,500 in a single year link and how top officials working on the government’s Covid response made well-timed trades [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-washington-officials-stocks-trading-markets-stimulus-11666192404) when the pandemic began–both as the markets plunged and as they rallied.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matter that could significantly affect their personal finances, but there are many loopholes [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-million-amazon-conflict-washingtons-ethics-czars-struggle-to-enforce-stock-trading-laws-11666360815)—and the consequences of this investigation are yet to be seen. 

We’ll be answering questions live starting at 2pm ET, so ask us anything.

personalfinance,How much cash should I have before buying a house?,"Hello to the wonderful /r/personalfinance community,

I'm planning on buying a \~$300,000 house sometime in the next 6 months. I'm wondering how much of my stock positions I should liquidate in anticipation now that stock prices have surged somewhat. At these interest rates, I'm considering selling off my entire position, but I'm wondering what y'all think.

Here are the numbers:

**Income:** \~$5,500 a month take home (after taxes, insurance, 401k contribution)

**Cash:** $35,000 including 10k emergency fund. This should rise to about $50,000 in 6 months.

**Non-Retirement Investments:** $65,000 domestic stocks &amp; ETFS

personalfinance,New I-bonds at 6.89% is it still worth it?,"I heard about I bond from this sub! They were alot higher a few months ago and I though they would go up to 12% they did not. I have a Lending club high yield savings account where I get %3.08 apy. The I bonds are double that currently and are probably still worth it, right? They are just not as high as I expected and I'm disappointed. I'm also worried that in 2 years they will be less then bank interest or the market but I know I'm ignoring the gains I can make over the next year or 2. I know 3 months of interest is still worth the year of double interest rates. 

TLDR: Just tell me its still a good idea to buy the bonds

Follow up questions

When the rate drops to a point where I'm not happy with it should I wait 3 months to sell it at that new rate to pay lower interest?

Should I buy multiple bonds like 10 $10 vs 1 $100 bond so I can sell it off in pieces?",finance,1667412042

stocks,Fed approves 0.75-point hike to take rates to highest since 2008 and hints at change in policy ahead,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday approved a fourth consecutive three-quarter point interest rate increase and signaled a potential change in how it will approach monetary policy to bring down inflation.

In a well-telegraphed move that markets had been expecting for weeks, the central bank raised its short-term borrowing rate by 0.75 percentage point to a target range of 3.75%-4%, the highest level since January 2008.

The move continued the most aggressive pace of monetary policy tightening since the early 1980s, the last time inflation ran this high.

Along with anticipating the rate hike, markets also had been looking for language indicating that this could be the last 0.75-point, or 75 basis point, move. Specifically, some Fed officials along with Wall Street economists and strategists in recent weeks had talked of a “step-down” in policy that could see a rate increase of half a point at the December meeting and then a few smaller hikes in 2023.

That language was not overt in the post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, though there was a tweak that could point to an adjustment in policy.

This week’s statement expanded on previous language simply declaring that “ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate.“

The new language read: “The Committee anticipates that ongoing increases in the target range will be appropriate in order to attain a stance of monetary policy that is sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent over time.“

The statement reiterated that policy changes “will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Markets will look to Chairman Jerome Powell’s news conference at 2:30 p.m. for more clarity on whether the Fed thinks it can implement less restrictive policy that would include a less dramatic level of rate hikes to achieve its inflation goals.

Along with the tweak in the statement, the FOMC again categorized growth in spending and production as “modest” and noted that “job gains have been robust in recent months” while inflation is “elevated.” The statement also reiterated language that the committee is “highly attentive to inflation risks.“

The rate increase comes as recent inflation readings show prices remain near 40-year highs. A historically tight jobs market in which there are nearly two openings for every unemployed worker is pushing up wages, a trend the Fed is seeking to head off as it tightens money supply.

Concerns are rising that the Fed, in its efforts to bring down the cost of living, also will pull the economy into recession. Powell has said he still sees a path to a “soft landing” in which there is not a severe contraction, but the U.S. economy this year has shown virtually no growth even as the full impact from the rate hikes has yet to kick in.

At the same time, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure showed the cost of living rose 6.2% in September from a year ago – 5.1% even excluding food and energy costs. GDP declined in both the first and second quarters, meeting a common definition of recession, though it rebounded to 2.6% in the third quarter largely because of an unusual rise in exports. At the same time, housing prices have plunged as 30-year mortgage rates have soared past 7% in recent days.

On Wall Street, markets have been rallying in anticipation that the Fed soon might start to ease back as worries grow over the longer-term impact of higher rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained more than 13% over the past month, in part because of an earnings season that wasn’t as bad as feared but also amid growing hopes for a recalibration of Fed policy. Treasury yields also have come off their highest levels since the early days of the financial crisis, though they remain elevated. The benchmark 10-year note most recently was around 4.04%.

There is little if any expectation that the rate hikes will halt anytime soon, so the anticipation is just on a slower pace. Futures traders are pricing a near coin-flip chance of a half-point increase in December, against another three-quarter point move.

Current market pricing also indicates the fed funds rate will top out near 5% before the rate hikes cease.

The fed funds rate sets the level that banks charge each other for overnight loans, but spills over into multiple other consumer debt instruments such as adjustable-rate mortgages, auto loans and credit cards.

# Final Comment

AMC is a heavily indebted company; the leverage is unsustainable, and the company is struggling to have positive net income. Its Cash Burning Rate is at 2.56, meaning its spending 2.5 times more its cash availability, giving the company a life expectancy of 30 moths with its current cash &amp; cash equivalents. It will need to cash in accounts receivables to extend more its life expectancy.

Income quality dropped drastically since 2018, it means that total earnings do not correspond to the actual cash intake from its operations.

Cash Ration indicate that the company will struggle to pay its current liabilities with its current cash.

Without  a drastic change in its fundamentals, the company is in high risk.

It is advisable to keep an eye on the Company operations and Management Action and evaluate possible adjustments for the final pricing without any changes in trends, the company is destined to die.

Home Equity/Escrow - Not entirely sure what these are and how they benefit me. I do know the cost of my home since I bought it has gone up 20% on Zillow and I remember hearing about people last year being able to refinance and get rid of their PMI

Personal loan - Absolute last resort, especially with how interest rates are now =/

Is there anything else that would be best to use or some insight someone could give on best next steps?

Thanks everyone! Cheers!",finance,1667418184
stocks,Fed's Powell: 'Soft landing' chances have narrowed,"Nov 2 (Reuters) - There remains a chance that the U.S. economy can escape a recession as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to lower inflation, but that window of opportunity for a ""soft landing"" has narrowed this year as price pressures have been slow to ease, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday.

""Has it narrowed? Yes,"" Powell said at a press conference after the Fed's latest rate hike. ""Is it still possible? Yes.""

stocks,"If the Cleveland Fed Nowcast proves accurate for October and November, we probably won't be talking about a pivot.","The Cleveland Fed's Nowcast is currently predicting 8.09% and 8.05% CPI reads for October and November, respectively (annualized, of course).  That is against an 8.2% number for September.  If this were to prove accurate, I have a hard time believing the market will view a pivot as imminent.

And these Nowcast figures are not due to some fluke of the monthly numbers.  The monthly predictions are .67% and .76.  Annualizing just those monthly increases puts us at or over 8% annually for CPI.  That is not supportive of an ""inflation is slowing"" narrative.

tl;dr for those who need it: Cleveland Fed's Nowcast is predicting the equivalent of 8%+ annualized CPI for both October and November.

personalfinance,Looking for Advice on the timing of a Housing Purchase (USA) - We are looking for opinions on buying now VS waiting for better interest rates. More Details inside!,"Greetings Personal finance! 

Long time lurker here on my alt for privacy. 

My SO and I moved across country for a job earlier this year. We moved from the high cost of living Denver, to the even higher cost Seattle Washington. Fortunately for us the timing of the purchase happened prior to the major interest rate hikes, and we were able to secure a great price for our house in Denver, and made a significant amount of cash at closing (I'll provide details in a bullet list below). When we arrived in Seattle, we chose to rent a home in the area so we could explore the city before putting down roots in a location we actually prefer, over the dart throw of the rental I choose.  We have 5 more months on our lease in this home and now that my SO has secured a Job here in town, we are beginning the house search in earnest. 

&amp;#x200B;

 **Details**

*  We have $230,000 from the sale of our home available for a down payment 
* Combined, we make around $215,000 per year depending on bonuses, etc
* Our current rent is $2750 a month for a 3bd/3ba which is big enough to hold our stuff, so we did not need to get a storage facility off site.   
   * Our Landlord has already indicated they will raise the rent to a cool 3,000 next year.
* We are looking to buy a home in the $750,000-1 Million dollar range, but would also be willing to buy a house that needs reno for a lot cheaper, since we have so much cash available 
*  I am Military and have access to the VA Loan Program
* We additionally own a condo back in Colorado that we are renting out. It has gained several hundred thousand in equity since I purchased it, and it has a 3%ish interest rate, and about 22 years left on the mortgage. We would like to keep it if we can, but if there was a strong reason to pull the equity from selling it, and combine it with our cash reserves, we would be willing to do so 

&amp;#x200B;

**Options**

Here is where Id like your all's advice. With the Seattle real estate market cooling faster than the rest of the country, we think it is a good time to get in with our cash reserves. However, we know that we would be paying a lot more in interest for likely the next few years. As it stands we can see three options: 

1. Buy over the holidays when the market is typically the most buyer friendly. We'd take advantage of the cooling prices, and would be able to causally move our stuff over from the rental, and not have to renew our lease in March. We would however, pay prolly some of the highest interest rates in years, but could just accept the pain for a few years and Refi when they came down. 
2. We could renew our rental agreement and hope for better buying conditions in the later parts of 2023. Cooler prices, better rates, but at the cost of 36,000 (3000 X12) in rent. 
3. Sell the Condo we own in Colorado, which would likely net us an additional $200,000 in cash that we could use for either down payment or reno cash. Consolidation of funds, but then we would be out our rental property. 

&amp;#x200B;

What are everyone's thoughts here? We think Option #1 is likely the best, but we know there are a lot of factors and ideas we might be overlooking.

Any help you all can provide would be great!   Thanks so much!",finance,1667418736

personalfinance,Mortgage versus student loans,"On mobile so forgive any poor formatting…

I am going back to school in January to get a masters in my current field to better my growth opportunities long term. I will, without a doubt, need student loans to do this. My program cost about $35k for a year and 3 months and I expect to be able to contribute about $10-15k via cash and tuition reimbursement through my work. I expect the interest rate to be around 4.99%. 

I bought my home last year at a 3.125% interest rate and currently contribute about $115 extra per month towards the principle, which is about 8% more than my minimum payment. According to a calculator from my lender, this will allow me to pay off my mortgage about 5 years early. I do not intend to stay at this home for the full duration of the loan, but I only put 5% down, so I wanted to build equity for the first few years to get rid of PMI. Though the market upswing in early 2022 has helped and I now have around 17% equity in my home. 

Other than my home, I have no debt. Car is paid, credit cards are paid in full each month, undergrad loans are paid, etc. 

Does it even make sense to be paying extra on my mortgage when it’s such a low rate when I could be contributing that additional $115 to education costs? Does this $115 even make enough of a dent to my education fund over the next year and a half to matter (it’s under $2k between now and expected graduation date)?",finance,1667420318

inflation,Ahhh.. Fed raises rates .75 points again… administration “gets money printer ready”,"The lag of inflation hikes is destroying the middle class. While it’s a stable and easy to control market factor to level the current inflation rate it seems we are putting a band-aid over a bleeding artery.  This ENTIRE situation was not caused by the consumers, it was government overreach that said “free stuff for you…free stuff for you…. Oh and you to!” 

It’s crazy that Americans are suffering for political policies that do nothing but hinder the recovery. Case and point giving the USPS 3 billion USD to purchase EV vehicles. Or maybe the other 900 million to create charging stations. I’m not against the free market overtaking and consuming another platform if it’s a natural movement but that’s completely disregarded in this situation, EVs lack infrastructure. EVs lack adequate technology to even compete in range with a majority of the ICE driving today. 

They play this as the change to save the earth but current estimations show that if a majority of the U.S. were to become EV it would change the temperature 1/10,000th of a degree. 


Blue collar jobs are at stake, the housing market is stupid, and the lack of regulation on affordable rent is the only baffling aspect I can’t comprehend, you want people to shy aware from debt yet people have to decide between an insane interest rate on a mortgage or pay $1,600-3,200/month for rent?

Ive been at my current job since March 2021 and i make a salary now of *52K a year*.  
I get paid weekly and my paychecks are \~*760.00 a week*.  
I also get a *$350 expense check once a month* for using my car/cell phone for work.  
My question is based around the quarterly profit-sharing bonuses that we get if the company can do them.  
I just received the Q3 bonus yesterday, and it was \~\~$**5,000.00,**  after taxes, so \~\~$5,000.00 is what was deposited into my account.   
I have some credit cards, and some bills of course, and Im just curious... what would YOU do with the bonus money if you were in my situation, given the below information?  
Before I got this bonus, I had about $1,000.00 to my name between 2 banks and some spare cash.

**RENT** is $2600 a month, i split this with my boyfriend so its about $1300 my end for Rent.  
**Utilities/Power**: \~100 for my end  
**CAR INSURANCE**:  $195 a month Geico  
**streaming tv music stuff**: $25 a month  
**CAR PAYMENT:** 366-406 a month  
**CREDIT CARDS**: 307-327 a month  
**GROCERIES/other necessities/pet things** : \~$1000   


**American Express Card, cancelled, have not used it in years, will never use it again**  
***balance = $4,446.76***, monthly payments of $200, the purchase APR is 26.99%  so I cant even imagine how much the interest charges are, I cant even login to the online account to see.  


**Capital One credit card, I have not used it in years, will never use it again**  
***Balance = $1,530.00***,   27.9% variable APR,   payments between $60-$80 a month, interest charges are like almost $40 a month. UGH  


**Capital One Auto Loan**  
maturity date 1/10/26, opened august 2019, APR is 11.63%, 77 month loan, ive had 4 extensions when i lost my job in 2020, and I make monthly payments between $366-406.  it says 15,011 remaining, principal balance 12,338.00.   


**Citibank Credit card, cancelled, will never use it again**  
this one has a 0% APR until i pay the balance off, so its $47 a month until i pay off the card. i dont know what the balance is, havent logged into the account in years, but feels good that this one isnt racking up interest and that i can just pay 47 a month until its all paid off. Thanks, Citibank LOL.  


I really want to use about $300 of the bonus to get my dog neutered. 

and my partner and i desperately need a new bigger bed... maybe we could finance the bed if we can get a 0% interest rate? I feel like that would be better than paying outright $1,500 or more for a mattress and simple frame... okay now I am just venting a little too much to y'all! LOL Thank you so much again for giving me some insight as to how you would work with the bonus, I appreciate it!!",finance,1667421974

**See the real-time analysis of this portfolio at** [https://degenomic.com](https://degenomic.com/)

TL;DR

* **What is this thing?** After blowing a few accounts on terrible single-name crypto choices, this portfolio/project was set up to see if DCA'ing emotionlessly would prove a profitable strategy over the long run.
* **How's it performing?** At the end of month 5, the portfolio has a lifetime return of 12.49%. Total inflows since inception are $1720.28 and the portfolio value stands at $1935.09, yielding a lifetime PnL of $214.81.

# Macro Overview

Heading into the final week of October, the fund looked like it was settling at a negative to flat month-to-date return. That was until Elon Musk decided to expedite his purchase of Twitter and unleash a suggestive Shib Inu themed tweet upon the world. Since then, DOGE 2x'ed, with SHIB trailing hot on it's coattails.

Ethereum also had a strong month, with the after effects of the transition to Proof-of-Stake starting to become apparent. Since switching to POS, net issuance of new ETH tokens have fallen dramatically; as of writing, \~1.3k new tokens have been issued compared with \~480k had the chain still been on PoW. This means the inflation rate has fallen from 3.6% to near 0%. Given that \~50k ETH has been burnt in transaction fees over the same time period, ETH is now a deflationary asset. Less tokens to go around with a constant market cap means a higher price per token.

These tailwinds have led to a broader rally across the board but crypto still remains susceptible to unfavourable macro conditions. Earlier today, the FOMC delivered a fourth straight 75bp hike, whilst also signalling an intention of pivoting to a slower pace in the coming months, amidst a landscape of high inflation and an increasing risk of recession. The hope of slower tightening has contributed in part to the recent rally in risky assets, but selling pressure could return if the Fed (at a later date) decides to pour cold water on the idea of slower tightening.

# Performance Detail

The return for October alone was a respectable 15.36% (a PnL of $257.61), compared to last months return of -0.09%. Total inflows for this month stood at $376.61.

https://preview.redd.it/48dg4puvolx91.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41ec561a1bae9dd5c9229673ccafe5963bbe8e3f

&amp;#x200B;

After a strong performance in July, followed by two consecutive months of underperformance, the strong return in October puts the portfolio back into the green.

https://preview.redd.it/z8nzvpg2plx91.png?width=740&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ef3bfd3f03acaa4440ca6452c4c0ece284733e9a

&amp;#x200B;

DOGE in particular has had a stellar month with an extraordinary return of 108.31% (thanks to Elon for that one). Smart contract platforms as a group also performed well; ETH (19.90%), BNB (15.75%) and AVAX (14.56%) all posting double digit returns.

The biggest losers were ADA (-4.17%) and XRP (-2.04%).

That leaves our performance for 2022 so far at:

&amp;#x200B;

|**2022**|**Return**|
|:-|:-|
|June|\-1.01%|
|July|22.28%|
|August|\-14.22%|
|September|\-0.09%|
|October|15.36%|
|**YTD**|**12.49%**|

&amp;#x200B;

# Asset Allocation

The portfolio currently holds: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOT, DOGE, SHIB, MATIC, AVAX, LINK and RUNE. DOGE's outperformance this month means it occupies 13.5% of the total value of the portfolio. This contrasts to RUNE which occupies 5.6%, despite both DOGE and RUNE having similar amounts of inflows.

&amp;#x200B;

Here we can see this continue to play out, with an increase in the index resulting in stronger performance in the portfolio. The dark red line represents a period of 'Extreme Fear', the light red represents 'Fear' and the white section represents 'Neutral'. Over the last few weeks, sentiment is starting to turn more positive, with a FGI score climbing into the low 30s.

# Final Comments

Thank you for getting this far and for showing an interest in this project. As someone who doesn't have the time to watch charts all day, this was set up as an easy, emotionless and consistent strategy to gain exposure to crypto, and I am curious to see how this portfolio performs over the long term. Seeing the portfolio [ebb and flow in real-time](https://degenomic.com/) also gives one a perspective for how volatile the crypto universe is.

I hope you've found this post interesting and gives you some inspiration for your own adventures in crypto.

CryptoCurrency,Takeaways from Powells words,"One of the more interesting FOMC meetings because of the market murmurs of a potential ‘pivot’ (not an actual pivot, but either talks of a pause soon or a slowing of rate hikes). This is for a couple reasons some of which include a US dollar that’s absolutely crushing international markets, bond yields appeared close to rolling over, Fed members starting to show concern about overshooting as they approach the previously projected terminal rate.

It started out with a fairly bullish statement from the Committee saying:

*In determining the pace of future (rate) increases, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.*

Basically expressing they want to give room to see how their policy will be reflected in the data going forward, which validates alot of what was being said about being *actually* data dependent instead of smashing the 75bps button.

Now in the past several FOMC meeting theres been a dump going into 2PM release followed by a pump going into Powells presser (he usually says dovish things or not much of anything at all = net positive) but today Dark Powell showed up and basically put to bed the whispers of a micro-pivot for the time being.

*The incoming data since our last meeting suggest the terminal rate of Fed Funds will be HIGHER than previously expected, and we will stay the course until the job is done.*

This is bad, earlier in the year the FFR was ~4% with rates potentially being cut in 2023. If anybody remembers the Summary of Economic Projections (quarterly dot-plot where Fed members reevaluate where they see monetary policy going next few years) there was a huge dump because the average predicted was ~4.6% with *no cuts until atleast 2024* (https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf). Powell reiterating this now of all times when market wants a shift in policy though is not good, and the market has now adjusted its projected FFR rate to ~5% (did they really think they could take down &gt;8% inflation with such low rates in the first place??).

*It is VERY premature to think about or talk about pausing our rate hikes.*

Powell just unabashedly dunked on everyone here, hes clearly trying to shut down any prematurely stimulative rally and wants to make it clear that theres more puking left to do.

And finally this gem: 

*Risk management is key here: if we were to overtighten, we could use our tools to support the economy later on; but if we failed to tighten enough, inflation would become entrenched and that would be a much bigger problem*

Dark Powell seems to not share the sentiment of his fellow Fed members. Overshooting is not a word hes familiar with since his tool, the money printer, can out BRRR any problem they create and his only kryptonite is inflation.

Anyways this is all definitely a net negative, crypto dump is not that bad (yet). Still more news to come with unemployment, NFP, and CPI all within the next 8 days. It is moon day today though so enjoy.",cryptocurrency,1667424786

economy,Clarification,"I’ve been stuck on this for the past months at this point. From what I learned over the years studying accounting/finance/economics - I thought that during the expansionary phase of the economic cycle inflation is increased and interest rates are increased in an effort to slow down spending/economic growth. After the markets hits a peak, we slowly regress into a recessionary period (where we are now) and interest rates begin to decrease along with price levels to encourage more borrowing/spending. What I’m confused about is we are currently in a recession and faced with high borrowing rates and high inflation. It seems like it’s a double negative? Where does this ideally put average citizens in the next year or so if rates continue to increase along with inflation? Given these market conditions, when would we ideally plan to see the end of the recession?

personalfinance,Money Market vs. Checking &amp; HYSA,"Hello, I'm thinking about switching banks due to paltry rates (0.01% APY). I was looking around for places with high (and possibly equal) APY for checking and savings, such as SoFi.

It occurs to me though that, with Federal Reserve Regulation D amended, the 6 transactions/month limit that applies to savings and money market accounts is gone. This means that for a money market account with debit card and check writing, one can use it exactly as a checking account.

For example, I can get an Ally HYSA (2.5% APY) and an Ally checking account (0.25% APY) and do the typical dance of moving checking funds to HYSA and vice versa as needed to pay bills and maximize interest.

On the other hand, Ally's MMA gets 2.5% APY, has check writing and debit card, no penalty for performing over 6 transactions. I could use it exactly like a checking account and I won't need to shuffle money. Is there a reason to prefer HYSA &amp; Checking over using a single MMA?",finance,1667434417
personalfinance,Budgeting.....Sanity check / feedback prior to cabin purchase,"I've been in the market for a semi off-grid property. I am in the loan pre-approval process and considering making an offer on one of my favorite available properties. The stats are as follows:

* Northern NY
* 3 Acres 
   * ""Unimproved"" / ""Raw"" land with a creek running through it. Significant elevation changes
* \~ 300 sq.ft. ""barn/cabin"" in reasonable shape with no obvious signs of deterioration.
* Electricity
* no running water (long term plan to either get a well or collect rain/creek water)
* Assessed at 35k, $1000/yr in taxes currently
* Directly off main road

No regular banks were remotely interested in financing this since the property doesn't meet the usual mortgage requirements of a permanent residence (full utilities). Finally, I learned of some local banks that were familiar with the area and the type of property and were happy to finance it with a loan. They consider it a ""cottage/cabin"" deal and require 20% down and a 0.75% increase over the current mortgage rates - seems fair to me. 

The property is listed for $76k. I estimate to put 21K down for a $50,000 loan. 

* At 30 years and \~ 7.5% interest, payments are around $345/month
* I've yet to sort out details like insurance or utilities

I currently am paid \~$93-98k/year. My recurring monthly costs are as follows..

* $400 rent
* $15 phone
* $75 car insurance
* $150 gas
* $200 food
* $750 bucketed ""misc."" category of needless/unexpected spending

Takeaway pay after maxing 401k and other expenses like insurance is $1000 per week.

My only debt is $11,000 in remaining student loans, which, ironically I just applied for forgiveness (we'll see). My savings are around $60,000 cash (I know), $75,000 in 401k, and another $70k in stock investments. I expect my monthly costs to be around 400 (loan) + 100 (tax) = \~ $ 500/month to own the property. So around $6,000/year. 

Why am I writing all of this out? I'm hoping to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation or gone through a similar ""numbers crunch"" to see what you did or what you think of my proposed plan. I know that I can technically afford it, but do you think it would be too financially reckless / crippling such that I would regret it down the road? I'm in my mid 30s. Is it absurd to purchase a ""fun"" property when interest rates have skyrocketed and I will end up paying 6.5-7.5%? Or should I accept that as the new norm and move on with life? 

Lastly, I could try to rent out the cabin though that is not my primary reason for purchasing it. Is this a viable consideration?",finance,1667434699

CryptoCurrency,Don’t fight the FED,"Most people are at least somewhat aware of what was said at the FOMC meeting today. 75 bps raise as expected, along with some hawkish talk from Papa Powell. 

Now I’ve been hearing talk on all corners of the internet, from Reddit to YouTube to Twitter this past month. Talking about this “PIVOT” that is going to happen. They think that the FED is going to decide to slow or even stop rate hikes soon.  

I have no idea where they got this idea. Did anyone listen to what Powell said at the last 2 meetings? He stated as clear as day that they don’t give a damn about your stocks or crypto. They don’t care about foreign countries writing sad letters. They answer to nobody. 

In today’s meeting, Powell doubled down yet again. There will be no pivot. When asked when rates would slow or be lowered, he almost laughed. He made it clear that he would rather raise too much and deal with those consequences rather than letting inflation get even worse. 

The FED is going to crush the economy. Company earnings will continue to decline. Guidance will continue to be bleak. Unemployment and a full on global recession are almost guaranteed at this point.

personalfinance,Should I let $5k CC debt go to collections if I can't make minimum payments?,"Let me preface this by saying I would just like advice on right now. I realize I have been severely irresponsible with finances in the past - I was diagnosed with bipolar recently and it's clear my mania and CC debt matched up perfectly. I am literally in therapy for that right now and I go over my current spending with my therapist weekly and know the credit cards aren't the best for me right now. I'm also medicated and doing great. But now I have to clean up the mess so I can move on in life. Please, please be kind and just give me advice and not too much judgement.

I had 25k in CC debt, declared bankruptcy, paid off the law firm fine, and a month later was offered a CC by Capital One. I figured I could use it to rebuild my credit responsibly just like my bankruptcy class told me I should. That didn't happen - instead in a bout of mania I used to to buy appliances for my family (parents washer, fridge, and stove have been slowly giving out) and then bought my brother a new wardrobe since he had a teenage growth spurt and was only wearing old clothes. This was in one week that I maxed out a $5k card. I don't even fucking remember that week. I got the bill in the mail and knew that I had a huge problem. I cut the card first but then called for a mental health evaluation. Mania and credit card debt are very connected - if you search 'bipolar and debt reddit' you can see that it sucks. I'm now medicated, in therapy, and not surprisingly my brain isn't using spending as a way to make me feel good. 

My credit is already fucked from the bankruptcy, so I can't open a card for balance transfer or take out a personal loan. I know $5k isn't insane in the scope of things. But I can't make the $400 minimum payment right now and when I called Capital One, they suggested I can make lower payments but it'd still add late fees and make the balance continue to go up. Oh, and it's 26% interest. Yes, yes, I know. I asked for a payment plan and the first payment was more than $400 originally to catch up with a late fee. 

I don't have savings, I don't have a car, I don't have a spouse, and I already work 2 jobs to survive. 

I'm thinking about just letting it go to collections and dealing with it then rather than dealing with that interest rate. I am happy to pay it, but dear god that interest rate. 

Any tips for last minute options to ask Capital One? Can they lower the interest rate for a while as long as the card isn't used? Or is it worth having it go to collections and hoping I can work it out better?",finance,1667437913
personalfinance,Self Employed Tax Situation in New York City [Question],"I'm looking into what the tax implications would be if I were to switch into a self-employed situation in New York City, where I plan on moving to within the year. The taxes are insane if I'm looking at them properly so I was wondering if there's something I'm missing or not considering.

Essentially if I bring in $150,000 pretax income then this is what I'm calculating as the break down.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Federal Taxes**
   * Marginal Rate: 22.000%
   * Effective Rate: 16.239%
   * Total Paid Out: $24,359
* **FICA**
   * Effective Rate: 15.300%
   * Total Paid Out: $22,950
* **State Taxes**
   * Marginal Rate: 6.330%
   * Effective Rate: 6.003%
   * Total Paid Out: $9,005
* **New York City Local Taxes**
   * Marginal Rate: 3.867%
   * Effective Rate: 3.801%
   * Total Paid Out: $5,702

&amp;#x200B;

**Total Taxes Paid:** $62,016

**Effective Tax Rate:** 41.188%

**After Tax Income:** $87,984

&amp;#x200B;

Is that right? A 41% effective tax seems insanely high. I think I'm missing the implications of expense deductions but I guess I don't know how to handle those as a self employed individual. Would these rates be based on AGI or GI?

CryptoCurrency,A summary of the Fed Meeting.,"here is what the [best](https://twitter.com/NickTimiraos) Fed watcher had to say about the Fed Meeting's press conference. 

The 3 takeaways from Powell's press conference:

1) The Fed could step down to a slower pace in Dec even if inflation data don't improve much

2) If there had been new estimates of the terminal funds rate released today, they would have moved up

3) Not ready to talk about a pause

&amp;#x200B;

From [another](https://twitter.com/jeannasmialek)Fed watcher

\- Big rate increases could slow in Dec or shortly after 

\- But rates will go higher than prior forecast 

\- And stay there 

\- His message was blunt: ""I would want people to understand our commitment to getting this done.""

\- Upshot: This was not a pivot.

&amp;#x200B;

Power wants to crash the markets. And he also wants to make you lose your job, bc the labor market is 'overheated'. He wants to see some people lose their job before he knows its ok to stop raising rates.

But hey at least the possibility of a soft landing is still there. ""Has the path to a soft landing narrowed? Yes. Is it still possible? Yes.""

How do we avoid a debt crisis:

Countries and corporations should only borrow in local currency. Households should borrow for investment, and avoid borrowing for consumption. 

And I believe that central banks can lower interest rates to near zero, despite inflation. A real zero or negative interest, which is nominally above zero, can still be attractive to savers/investors as it is better than holding cash ""under your matress"".

My credit score was in the mid 700's and even higher for &gt;10+ years, but has now dropped to the high 600's. I used some money from my TSP (3.88% interest rate) to pay down some of the debt on one of the credit cards with a higher interest rate where monthly payments were $400-something. I have one other card like that as well, but am still under the limit of the card -just barely. Traditionally I have used my credit union to take out personal loans (with 5% interest, but now rates are at least 10% at the lowest end), paid off the cards, and paid off the loan as fast as possible. Unfortunately, this time I owe too much now due to life hitting me hard over the past couple of years (divorce, single parent now, still waiting on child support, excessive rent/general inflation, etc.). I was told by a financial advisor to consider one of those loan consolidation companies that take on all my CC debt and give me an interest rate of about 10% or so. The only thing is I would have to close out all of my credit cards immediately, which would lower my credit score even more, and that lending company would show up on my credit report whereby it's presence not only would additionally lower my credit score, but also God forbid if I needed to buy a car, or wanted to get a house, it would make it really hard to do so until I've paid off the lender. Perk is, I might pay off the debt faster this way. I've created a spreadsheet with the amount of debt I owe, the min monthly payments due, the interest rate on each card, and whether it's variable or fixed, to get an idea of these expenses relating to my really tight budget. The two high balance cards are killing me financially, but here is the current breakdown after throwing $10k onto one of the high balance cards that was maxed out:
-CC #1: $5,656 (balance), 22.99%(v) APR, $246 (min monthly payment), $15k credit limit
-CC #2: $16,019 (balance), 23.24%(v) APR, $480.49 (min monthly payment), $20k credit limit
-CC #3: $5,525 (balance), 25.99%(v) APR, $150 (min monthly payment), $24,500k credit limit
-CC #4: $2,624 (balance), ? APR, $52.00 (min monthly payment), $5k credit limit
- Federal student loan payments will start back up in January - with IBR plan, guessing about $500-700/month since I have 2 dependents 


SO... Do I go with the lender and tough it out/pray nothing major happens that requires a credit check for like the next 5 years or so and have to rebuild my credit/history, or are there other options to try first (like paying down some of the debt with money from my TSP, continue paying the min amount due on the other cards in the meantime, wait for a little bit for my credit score to hopefully go back up with my utilization rate being lowered from the $10k I threw on the one card, then apply for a personal loan through my credit union to pay down the rest of it, that way credit cards remain active, I don't have that company on my report, and don't necessarily have to rebuild my credit)? 

What should I do?",finance,1667453458

stocks,Unpopular opinion: oil prices will stay high until oil stocks go up,"In a normal commodity cycle, the cure for high prices is high prices. However, that is no longer the case, and I will explain why I think that is the case. I will try to list sources where I can but a lot of this information has been synthesized over time and therefore you will just have to google some things. Even the sources I find will be articles I find on google to support my statements.

High prices do not necessarily create permanent demand destruction. Even in the worst parts of the 2008 recession, oil demand barely dropped. Not to mention that demand can recover and if the fed pivots, it can be quite inflationary at least for commodity prices where physical markets are tight.

Here is an article of which I only want to highlight a single sentence (but I figure I should include a source). 

https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/05/oil-demand-price-coronavirus-world-bank/

“In 2008, the Great Recession led to demand falling by 0.66%”

That is nothing! But supply had already grown too much from the shale boom, leading to a supply/demand balance that favored the buyer. Compared to today, however, as the bottom half of the world is lifted out of poverty, they will consume more oil. They will go from bikes to motorcycles and motorcycles to cars. Let’s be real: they aren’t getting EVs anytime soon.

Furthermore,  as europe heads into an energy crisis and Russian gas is no longer an option due to nordstream explosions (only one pipeline left but it’s way smaller capacity than before), they will need to burn more oil and coal. This could lead to a lot of gas to oil switching https://bisoninterests.com/content/f/gas-to-oil-switching-–-winter-is-coming

I DONT WANT to hear any poorly framed arguments about european storage being full or TTF going negative. It doesn’t matter. Here is why anyone that tells you that europe will be fine with their storage doesn’t know what they are talking about: If you are driving cross country and start with a full tank that can get you 20% of the way there (being generous here), does that mean you can automatically make it coast to coast? No. You have to gas up. Likewise, getting through winter is the same. Gas storage cannot account for the entire winter. They need constant inflows. Heating oil, diesel and coal are just LNG without the infrastructure and therefore Europe will go for those next.

That being said, demand is ultimately very difficult to pin down. What I would like to focus on is supply.

Biden often complains about oil companies doing buybacks and dividends. Why? Because at these prices, dividends and buybacks get shareholders better return than growth at these multiples. Why are multiples low? Because institutions have shunned fossil fuel companies too long and Yellen and Granholm have also told development banks to tighten lending conditions to oil companies. 

Divestment examples:

https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/exclusive-new-york-pension-fund-divest-half-its-shale-companies-2022-02-09/

Yellen and fossil fuel lending:

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-11/yellen-targets-curbs-on-development-bank-support-for-fossil-fuel#xj4y7vzkg


Besides that, analysts will say “shareholders want buybacks and dividends over growth.” It’s becoming a tired phrase. Who are shareholders here? Greedy people like me who want gains and don’t want to have them produce more without me making any more money, and etf and fund managers like blackrock and vanguard who only are custodians of the shares but get all the voting power. Guess what? Not only are they greedy too, but they also want to choke oil. Consequently, the sector globally is in liquidation. According to Rick Rule (who I trust a lot), the oil industry is $1b/day underinvested in sustaining current output. Furthermore, if, for example, Brent is at $110 and oil stocks price in $60, am I going to want to risk oversupply? No! Because I would be terrified about what share price would do if it priced in $60 at $110 and then the price actually dropped down to $60. What would it price in then? $20 at $60? $10? Negative?

OPEC also cannot ramp up production anytime soon. And why would they? 

https://time.com/6219783/opec-large-production-cut/

They want $90+ oil

https://www.reuters.com/world/macron-tells-biden-that-uea-saudi-can-barely-raise-oil-output-2022-06-27/

They can’t. Only Russia could have, but they needed western OFS, which all left the country, so their production will actually fall. 

We must rely on western oil companies.

Unpopular take: oil prices will remain heightened and volatile and spikes will persist until oil stocks go up. The cure to high prices is no longer high prices. It’s high oil stock prices. They are stupid cheap, and until they trade at reasonable multiples, shareholders and etf managers like blackrock and vanguard will not let them do anything but dividends and buybacks.  And that is great for CEOs and boards. No need to make hard choices. No need to take risks. Just say those two magic words, so of course they will choose the easy way.

tl;dr
Shareholders will only allow significant new production when stocks go up. Till then, buybacks and dividends.
If they are not making gains somehow, what the hell are they holding high torque cyclical stocks for? So stop throwing money into the bottomless hole that is tech. XOM just hit ATH. you will never make as much money as the guy you heard about it from, but there is room to run. If you are afraid of being late, late cycle OFS hasn’t outperformed yet. It’s a bull market.


edit: Regarding XOM being at ATH: No cause of concern yet. there are small caps cash flowing their market cap out there. I would buy those. But as for XOM, XOM/SPX chart shows we have a long way to go till overvaluation https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=XOM%2FSPX

ATH tells you one thing. inflation adjusted high says another. reinclusion into SPX will tell you another (people will frontrun that). Ratio chart is the most useful imo.

Cap went into effect in March 2020. COVID and fiscal measures made it so that the effect of these fixed rates weren’t seen for 2020 and upto mid 2021.
Then the whole world woke up. Our current account balance went to shit. Currency lost upto ~30% of value (it’s at ~22% now) and inflation has been ~10% and that’s due to the govt keeping it artificially low.
When the rate caps went into effect everything from bank stocks to financial sector wages and job openings went to shit.

*The Bank of England has warned the UK will see its longest recession since records began, as it raised interest rates by the most in 33 years.*

In its outlook for the UK economy, it said the country would face a ""very challenging"" two-year slump.

It also warned the unemployment rate will nearly double.

The Bank lifted the UK interest rate to 3% from 2.25%, the biggest increase since 1989.

It takes borrowing costs to their highest since 2008, when the UK banking system faced collapse.

Interest rates have been rising since last December as the cost of living has accelerated.

Prices are increasing at the fastest pace in 40 years.

The Bank believes by raising rates it will make it more expensive to borrow and encourage people not to spend money so easing pressure on prices.

The news will be welcomed by savers, but the rise will have a knock-on effect on for those with mortgages, credit card debt and bank loans.

# [Stock futures fall after the Fed dashes hopes for a pivot to softer tightening stance](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/02/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday after the Federal Reserve delivered another interest rate hike and signaled that no pivot or rate cut is coming anytime soon.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 164 points lower, or 0.51%. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.7% and 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; A spike in yields put pressure on futures. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield popped 14 basis points to 4.199%. The 2-year rate traded 16 basis points higher at 4.73%.
*****
&gt; Traders had anticipated the central bank’s 0.75 percentage point rate increase and initially read the Fed’s statement as dovish, sending stocks higher on Wednesday after the decision was delivered. Those gains then reversed when Fed Chair Jerome Powell said it was “premature” to talk about a rate hike pause and that the terminal rate would likely be higher than previously stated.
*****
&gt; “We still have some ways to go and incoming data since our last meeting suggests that the ultimate level of interest rates will be higher than previously expected,” he said.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Wednesday’s trading session 505 points lower, or 1.6%. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 2.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite was off by 3.4%.
*****
&gt; Markets will likely continue to seesaw until it is clear inflation has cooled off and that the Fed has stopped marching rates higher, with traders split over where interest rates are headed. Any data that shows the U.S. economy isn’t slowing as the central bank tightens policy will likely weigh on stocks.
*****
&gt; “In our view, the risk-reward for markets over the next three to six months is unfavorable, and today’s Fed statement supports that view,” wrote Mark Haefele, UBS’ chief investment officer in a note to clients Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the Bank of England implemented a 75 basis point hike on Thursday, its largest increase in 33 years, as it battles high inflation.

personalfinance,Save for a house or pay off student loans?,"Hi, not sure which way to go with this. Hopefully someone has some advice.

After federal loan forgiveness, I'll have $10k left on my student loans, at 4% interest. I'm paid up through August 2023. I have $11k in my savings currently and increase my cash savings at a rate of $7200 per year. I'd  like to have $20,000 in the bank when I go house hunting. I currently pay $1400/month in rent which will likely increase $50-100 per year until it hits $1800.

If I pay off my student loans now I'll be stuck renting for at least another 3 years to save up the money for a house. If I don't pay my loans off I can start looking for a house in just over a year. Which makes more sense financially?",finance,1667482922

personalfinance,Revisiting the “should we pay off the mortgage early” question.,"It’s a frequent question that comes up here with the consensus being that mathematically it makes sense to NOT pay off a mortgage early and instead invest any extra money for a better return. It also can keep your money more liquid, depending. 

Paying off early, psychologically there is a benefit of being debt-free as early as possible, having the security of a paid off home, and having the guaranteed risk free return of whatever your mortgage rate is. 

I’ve been in the “pay off early” camp because I am debt and risk adverse and like the idea of being free of debt as soon as possible. However, a couple of things have made me reconsider recently, and it might be something to think about, depending on your situation. 

First, my current employment situation has meant somewhat of a decrease in income, so looking to cut back, the extra $500 a month we had been throwing at the mortgage seemed like a simple and easy place to start, with the only real consequence being the delay of paying off the house. 

Second, during the pandemic when rates were at rock bottom we refinanced to a 20 year at 2.5%, which is virtually nothing. Now with rates quickly rising, the interest rate on our savings account (capital one 360) just went up to 3%. 

We’re now in the situation that we are better off just leaving any extra money we may have in the savings account - the easiest, laziest, and most risk free “investment” possible. 

This is all to serve as a reminder that finances are personal, first of all, and that the economy is fluid and changing, especially right now, and what may have held true last year might not be true now and it is always worth reevaluating your financial strategy. Just thought it was worth talking about.",finance,1667484599

stocks,Arguments against buying EUR-hedged S&amp;P500 ETF from Europe?,"Hi all,

About me: I'm 27, living in Europe, and earn more than half of my income in euros, but also a solid portion in dollars (overemployed) with a good chunk of disposable income each month. All savings are in euros currently, but I'm planning to invest most of it somewhat soon.

Right now I have a big lump sum just waiting to be invested into the stock market. The majority of it is very likely to go into S&amp;P500 tracking ETF. By default I'd go with something like iShares S&amp;P500 Accumulating or something like that, however, the exchange rate movements this year make it hard not to at least consider going the route of EUR-hedged funds.

When you look at the index performance in euro prices, the index isn't in that much of a dip, because the downturns have been offset by the dollar skyrocketing.

Now, I understand, we don't generally know the future of forex exchanges, and EURUSD can go down as much as it can go up.

However, this is what's bugging me: the dollar skyrocketing against the euro has been significantly driven by the Fed raising rates more aggressively than the ECB, and the increasing rates and the strong dollar also pulled the stocks down. I'm afraid that when the Fed pivots, the stock market will surge, but this will also bring the dollar down, leaving me without good gains in my native currency.

On the other hand, if I buy EUR-hedged ETF shares, when the pivot happens I'll have both my shares and my native currency increasing in value. For this reason, to me it seems like buying EUR-hedged ETF shares has a higher likelihood of being a better decision at this moment, because I'll depend on two currents working in the same direction, rather than opposing (EURUSD vs S&amp;P500).

Please tell me why I'm wrong and talk me out of any misconceptions because I was never really interested in forex.",finance,1667485221
Bitcoin,Can anyone put together a Bitcoin chart where BTC is compared to other currencies rather than just the dollar?,"The reason I ask is that so many people tell me that Bitcoin is loosing value... it's hard to show them the truth but my response is that the dollar is gaining value through deflationary esc monetary policy, in turn, it takes less dollars to buy 1 BTC. 

To add to this, people in America only use the dollar and don't understand the 2+ currency world around them, so they're not familiar with the idea of the dollar not being the only mode of value transfere. 17 of the top G20 currencies have lost value to the dollar (between 7% and 30%) but Bitcoin is up 67% on the dollar and +70% across the board.

If someone were to put together a little website, with some ads on the side, that showed how expensive bitcoin is comapred to otger currencies, i believe it would do you well and would help me prove my point that Bitcoin is always the same but the dollar fluctuates and will inevitably be printed to infinity so exchanging dollars, while they are strong will provide you with higher rates of inter-generation wealth as the dollar will be diluted.",cryptocurrency,1667485300

If you agree to that statement then I'll continue. If not then feel free to comment what you think it's purpose is and try to answer my question based on that.

2: Having established the purpose of bitcoins existence, I'd like to ask how exactly that's going to actually work do to bitcoins limitations. It's been quite a long time since bitcoins inception and complex smart contracts to enable things like defi and NFTs just aren't possible to create and run on the Bitcoin Blockchain. There is no secret Satoshi left us to solve. It's just not physically possible or it would have been done by now and other smart contract chains would be deemed completely irrelevant.

If you agree with that statement then I'll continue if not please answer as to why I'm wrong.

3: without the ability to use native on chain smart contracts bitcoins use and ability to function in a monetary sense is gone. Yes you can send coins from wallet A to B. For simple transactions that's perfectly fine. But the world we live in is much more complex than that. People need to use money to take loans to buy cars and houses for example. Interest rates need to be calculated, automatic payment systems for Interest and principal and insurance need to be calculated and applied to each payment. And the Bitcoin Blockchain does not have the capability to do any of those things Natively. Not to mention investment vehicles like 401ks, IRAs, pensions, payroll, and countless other things. So in order to make that happen. Bitcoin needs to rely on an outside party. Centralized banks for example. Which clearly wouldn't work because then Bitcoin is no longer decentralized and your coins would be in control of a 3rd party. Or  an EVM side chain like stacks as another example. But stacks isn't native Bitcoin as it requires bridges and smart contracts. BUT Bitcoin maximalists claim that Everything aside from Bitcoin is a scam, or centralized, or a shitcoin. So from a maximalists perspective that shouldn't be allowed as an option either.

Thus, since neither option is allowed to exist from a maximalists perspective, how is Bitcoin supposed to function as a reserve currency without the assistance of a physical 3rd party like a centralized bank, or a smart contract side chain???

4: Blockchains reason for existing, is to sell blockspace. That blockspace is filled with transactions that are then processed by miners and passed along to nodes to very and keep track of. Miners receive revenue in 2 ways. Token issuance and transaction fees. Token issuance or inflation is paid to miners by the network and is reduced over time via the halvening events. Miners currently rely on that issuance AND transaction fees paid by users to operate profitably. Currently the vast majority of miners Revenue (90+%) comes from token issuance the rest from fees. Some miners are having a hard time staying above water right now because of the lack of demand for Bitcoin blockspace. As seen here at Cryptofees.info

Bitcoin is struggling to maintain consistent fees above Other chains and even the apps that run on those chains. At times it's several numbers down that list. So if demand for Bitcoin blockspace doesn't increase and the halvening events reduce the issuance that gets paid to miners how are miners going to operate in profit? And if they cannot operate in profit, then Bitcoin becomes vulnerable to attacks. 

Now I know that as miners drop off the network the revenue gets passed to the miners that stay on and should theoretically keep the network alive but all that does is kill off the smaller miners and centralize the mining pools/operations more and more overtime.

5: if you agree with the above statement then that means nobody can mine Bitcoin from home, only the people with access to vast amounts of capital or take enormous loans from centralized banks can afford to house and run miners. Keep in mind, miners are very loud and hot and expensive to maintain as large warehouses and expensive cooling is required. So with that being said. That means that Bitcoin can only survive on life support from corporate entities loans from banks, miners produced by ~5 companies and is no longer decentralized in any regard right??


Please take your time and answer everything point by point so it's easy for myself and other to read and digest. Thank you.

Yes the original purpose was a p2p currency. But that's obviously not a possibility anymore. Narratives change. The current Bitcoin maxi narrative is a store of value, reserve currency, digital gold narrative. This is what I'm referring too.

personalfinance,Engaged to someone with a lot of student loans.,"Hello!

I'm over the moon to be engaged to my fiancée, and looking forward towards building a life together. One of the only sources of anxiety for me is the amount of Federal student loans she has. After going through undergrad, she is currently in graduate school getting her masters and in the end will come out with roughly around $90,000.

I've been debt free and in the very bottom part of [the flowchart](https://i.imgur.com/lSoUQr2.png), having established my own emergency fund, am saving for retirement, and am building a savings account. How would you recommend we work as a couple to best tackle her student loan debt? Should I start using some of my savings to pay some down? Should we just be paying a minimum (or slightly over)?

* We currently rent, however are exploring the option of buying a home (looking at home prices between $150k-$300k). 
* Each of us makes roughly $35k net (post-tax/deductions)
* We each own our own cars that are paid off
* No children yet
* No other debt outside those student loans
* Not counting my emergency fund, we will have a combined savings around $50k. 
* We are both in our early 30's.

Basically, my goal is to use the financial stage I am in to help my partner improve theirs. What are the best practices for that?

personalfinance,How should I allocate student loan payments saved up during covid deferment?,"During covid, student loan payments went into deferment with 0% interest. I decided to put my monthly payment of $850 into savings to gain interest while student loans were at 0%.

personalfinance,"Need advice: Invested part of inheritance in brokerage account, $18,000 gone, should I withdraw?","**EDIT:** Thank you all so much for the feedback and support!  I will take your advice and hold and try not to worry too much.  Thanks for the honesty and thoughtful input; it's appreciated!

Hello (throwaway account here),

In 2019, my grandfather left me with an inheritance.  I am now in the position to have a comfortable life if I play my cards right and don't make poor financial decisions.  My grandfather was very careful with money, but he was my last relative on my father's side of the family.  I have no one to turn to with regards to what I should be doing in terms of investments.  After doing research on this forum, I saw a lot of people regretted not investing earlier.  I opened up a ROTH IRA and have been contributing the max every year, but a part of me felt I wasn't making the most of my financial earnings if I didn't invest into a brokerage account, with the goal of a comfortable retirement in which I might be able to travel after I'm done with my working years.

Considering the advice on this forum, I paid down debts, padded up my emergency fund, and put a good chunk in savings.  I considered other big life milestones I have coming up as I'm in my early 30s, and after setting aside money to be financially prepared for those.  There's more financial information I'm not mentioning, but after serious consideration, I felt comfortable investing $180,000 into a diversified brokerage account.

The account is a mix of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.  I went with a service that has a good reputation and I have an advisor I trust.  But I am completely new to investing, and while I tried very hard to do my due diligence on this aspect of finances as I was heading into unfamiliar territory, I had no idea what I was getting into in terms of how drastically the trajectory of the stock market can affect your finances in such an account.

My account is now worth about $162,000 after the 400 point dip in the DOW yesterday.  I am concerned I am in over my head with investing in this kind of account.  With the whims of the stock market, it seems that large amounts of money can evaporate instantly.  I anticipated that the rises and falls of my account would be more moderate.  I don't know if losing $18,000 in four months in something I can particularly stomach, but I'm concerned if I close the account I will be making an incredibly stupid decision in light of the market always historically rebounding, and being of an age where I can wait another 30 years before I need the money for retirement.

However, I am concerned we're in unprecedented political territory that could shape the markets for a long time, and am unsure how much my account could really gain in this climate.  The last thing that's really giving me pause is that as far as I know, my grandfather never invested in a brokerage account, only Money Market accounts with high interest rates.  And thanks to his decisions, he didn't have to worry about money at the end of his life.

What should I do with this brokerage account?  I am fine with cutting my losses and closing the account right away, but again, I have never dealt with anything like this before and don't want to make a stupid, hasty decision.  I am turning to this thread because I have no one to turn to in real life, and am trying to make sound, fiscally responsible decisions while feeling like I don't have the understanding to make them (though I'm trying to learn).  Any advice would be tremendously appreciated.  Thank you.",finance,1667498531

I've been on the phone with banks, credit unions, debt consolidators, and debt settlement companies. I have moved nowhere. Here is a brief backstory that I will keep short and sweet.

My credit score has grown to 780+ over the past 8 years. My goal was to reach 800 just to feel like I was ""worth something"". At that time, I only had two credit lines with Chase. After a horrific accident in 2021, I almost became paralyzed. Only two of my four surgeries were covered by insurance. When I asked for guidance and loans, they only offered about half the amount (which I should have taken). To get the money I needed, I thought I'd use my credit history as ""leverage."" In 2021, I took out two more cards - an Amex and a Verizon credit card. This covered surgery and travel expenses.

I had three procedures last year and had my last one earlier this year. Each limb had one surgery, and I decided to do my arms first (since they were covered) and my legs last so I wouldn't need to pay more interest. In the present day, I have been stuck in an endless cycle of debt. Now my score is 650 and it keeps lowering.

Chase Freedom - 9,000 max limit- $600 minimum mo  
Chase Saphire - 20,000 max limit - $230 minimum mo  
Amex - 15,000 max limit - $450 minimum mo  
Verizon - 9000 max limit - $220 minimum mo

I am paying around $1100 in interest. If I put any extra money into the payments, interest eats it up.  
My monthly income is about $3,200. So far, I have never missed a payment in my life. It's difficult for me to know what to do. These settlers say nothing can be done and only they can help. I'm paying only interest and if I continue this way I'm owing 3 times my debt. Loans don't apply because my credit score has tanked. I can't get help from the creditors because ""there isn't anything we can do"", and what I'm understanding is that it's not until I miss a payment that something can be done.

It seems logical that if you have a $50,000 credit limit, you need to have a positive credit history to do so. I would like someone to take into account my history and not where I'm currently at. Nothing has changed other than the surgeries, if given the opportunity I can have it done in 3 years. I can still manage $700 monthly on a payment, no matter how it is handled. I put everything I make into these cards. Prior to surgery, I lived a minimalist lifestyle. I've cut even more than I thought I could. However, this isn't how life works.

Any direction I take will damage my credit, my history will be ruined, and I risk being sued. I'm lost. It is possible that I will be forced to file for Chapter 13, which means I still owe money plus a label on my credit report, settlers want me to miss payments, and I have never missed payments, so creditors can sue me, and I cannot obtain a loan when I have demonstrated I will keep paying even in times like this. I still pay off my monthly balance, but it hasn't made a dent yet. Having no late payments yet being able to pay all these interests seems riskier than having zero debt and missing 30 payments.

Ideally, when I pay this off, I would like to keep the bad marks off of my credit report. I don't mind labels for ten years, but dealing with debt-settlers might result in a label that stays with me for life. Having a bankruptcy label for 7-10 years and still having to pay the debt is 50/50. I'm not sure what to do.

It would be appreciated if you would refrain from lecturing me about interest rates and how I could have done it better. At the time when I needed surgery, I did what I thought was best, and I am grateful to be alive today. In my current situation, I would appreciate any insight, information, or suggestions you may have on a direction I can take.

Should we repay the loan?

The Loan:

In late 2020 my wife took a loan from her 401k to help us eliminate some old debt and mostly as part of a down payment for a house. We ended up getting the perfect house with a low interest rate, and are pretty happy with the decision all and all. We owe about $17,000 to her plan, and make payments of $510 for the next 36 months. We are 'paying' 5% interest on this, but the interest goes to her account. This entire loan cost us about $75 plus the lost potential growth. But with the current market, I'm not sweating that too much.

The Emergency Fund:

We have about $10,00 in a credit union savings account and add $800-1000 a month. This is almost 2 months of expenses (I know, rookie numbers). We have some credit lines, and can always take out a loan from my 401k in place of hers if we get in a pinch. We have ridiculously stable jobs, and an incredibly supportive (and local) family group that has always tried to help with money. So at the risk of sounding entitled, we aren't incredibly worried about the cash on hand.

Context  
TQQQ has fallen from $90 at ATH to just $17 now. Would you guys consider this a wise investment going medium to long term? If QQQ hits $200 within the next couple of months, TQQQ will be about $10-$14. And realistically, I don't see QQQ (currently $260) going below COVID lows of $170.   


I say this for a few reasons:  
1) Inflation exists, there is more cash in circulation now than in the pre-COVID markets.  
2) 2020 COVID was absolute panic and we just aren't there, we know more about what's happening in our economy than we knew about some random virus from China.   
3) QQQ has already fallen 35% (TQQQ 81%) from ATH and it fell 28% for COVID (TQQQ 71%). The upside of the market outweighs the downside of the market within the next couple of years.   
4) If you bought QQQ in 2010, you'd be up 650%. If you bought TQQQ in 2010, you'd be up 4000%. Across a long enough time horizon, the market always recovers, and TQQQ is more or less the same. So even if you don't time the market, if you just wait, your investment could easily multiply.   


Okay, so why is this important?   
If you bought TQQQ at the COVID low and sold at ATH, you'd have made over a 1000% gain. On the contrary, if you bought TQQQ at ATH and sold now, you'd be down 81% (as previously mentioned). Even if you are a bear, as long as the markets recover in some capacity within the next couple of years, your investment could have a lot of potential as long as you average down slowly in the short term.   


When could we see a pivot in the market?  
Well, I'm no genie, so I have no say in the matter. Although if you asked, ""how could we see a pivot in the market,"" I could answer. The answer is simple: when inflation cools down. I don't mean inflation has to be 0%, I mean cool down as in, there is a clear downturn in inflation that is enough to cause a FED pivot to decrease rates. Then, people will be able to buy houses again which will stimulate the economy and so on. If I had to take a bold guess, I could see this happening within 6 months because people are not buying things anymore like they have stimulus money, this will help inflation cool (because demand decreases, prices decrease) which will jumpstart the previously mentioned cycle.  


What are the downsides?  
Well, let's say that QQQ falls to the COVID lows of $270 within the next couple months, your investment would only be worth around $5. So yeah, good luck gaining that back. It would have to over 3x to get back to where it is today which, realistically, would take a long time.   


So, with all of this said, TQQQ would outperform the rest of the market if we see a green turn in the near future. It's okay to disagree with me for being bullish in the medium term, so tell me your thoughts. Do you think TQQQ is worth it right now?

personalfinance,Possible debt consolidation?,"Due to many factors (mostly immaturity and irresponsibility if I’m giving myself some tough love) we have racked up about $20k in credit card debt. 

Estimated debt:
Credit card 1- $3000-21% interest rate 
2: $7000-21% interest rate 
3: $9000- 24% interest 
4: $1500- 0% for the first year, honestly not sure why my husband recently opened this but I’m not happy about it and worried a new card might disqualify us from a loan. 
Car loan: $300 a month ~$12000 left on it
Mortgage: $1400 a month equity of ~$75000

Gross pay: $85k (edited from $90k after doing actual math and not guessing)
Take home: $75k 

I’m anxious and stressed all the time and think about this debt looming over us constantly. Do we have any options at all? Or do we just suck it up until I graduate college and can get a better paying job? Literally any sort of advice is appreciated, currently using the “snowball method” and paying off my lowest first, not sure how my husband is paying his off as we deal with our own debt separately. I know we need to communicate more. Thanks! 

Side note, I have not used my cards in months and though I’m not perfect my husband continues to show irresponsibility so I’m pretty worried about that and we’ll have to find some sort of way to fix that before making a move on possible consolidation.",finance,1667532208
personalfinance,Feeling buyer's remorse after having purchased a 41k car. What would you do?,"Hello everyone,

I was in a car wreck last Wednesday leading to the total loss of my car with about 220k miles on it. The value of the car is less than 5k, so I don't expect to receive much from this claim. It is already a paid-off car and didn't have any expenses other than gas, insurance, etc.

Also, my dashcam recorded the whole incident, proving another party is at complete fault and thus I won't be liable for any of the damages on both cars from the incident. I have hired a personal injury lawyer to handle this case, and I expect to receive some sort of payout from the car insurance company in about 6 months to a year.

Since I have to commute to the work office three times a week, I definitely need a car that is safe and reliable and even looks good, preferably. I have been car-shopping since last Thursday and found out that a used Accord or Civic costs around 30-35k out the door. Even though reliability and safety are the biggest factors when it comes to buying a car for me, I didn't feel too comfortable paying this much for these types of cars. My father has been driving Genesis G70 for a few years and told me how safe and reliable it is and told me to also consider buying this brand of car for aesthetics in addition to the two factors aforementioned.

I went to a dealership yesterday and found a used car that had a 40k price, which I negotiated down a price and ended up paying 41k out the door. I originally had savings of about 56k and I now only have about 14k after paying everything in cash (I initially thought about financing, but a 10 percent interest rate with a 730 credit score didn't seem to make sense to me at all).

I have been saving 5k a month in hopes of investing the bulk of this when the market 'crashes' in the height of the recession that is to come. I definitely feel like I am trading my lucrative investment opportunity for a car, but at the same time, I also desire to drive a car that looks as nice as its reliability and safety.

My gross income is 130k a year and 84k net income after tax and 401k. I can consistently save 5k a month, which indicates that it will take about 8 months of disciplined saving routines to see the lost 40k in my bank account again not considering insurance payout for now. Given the level of my shovel and how much I can save each month, can my purchase be justifiable or is it just plain stupid from a personal finance perspective? I am currently feeling agitated and remorseful that I spent more than 80 percent of my net worth, which I have accumulated in about a year, on something that will rapidly depreciate in its value.

My alternative for not buying a car is to use a rental service such as Flexcar or Enterprise in which I can spend about 500-600 a month to commute to work and get groceries, etc. I have until Saturday later morning to return the car and hopefully get the full money back. What should I do? **Should I just apologize to a dealership and get my money back to go with the monthly rental or just suck it up and own my decision?**

It is a bit pathetic of me to admit it, but I don't want to get something in the middle where I get the car that costs around 10-20k. For me, I am more comfortable choosing between the two (either buy a 41k car or just rent something out by spending 500-600 per month). I'd love your advice to determine how I should make my decision.",finance,1667532388

Generally speaking a lot of crypto is getting sudden trust &amp; lots of buying pressure right now. I've been trading the last hours and I'm not kidding when I say I trade a bullish strategy for the first time **since march.**

Now don't get me wrong this is most likely not the start of a bullrun since we are still in a recession, still fight high inflation ( CPI numbers next week btw ) &amp; the outlook after recent [FED meeting](https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20221102a.htm), or [Bank of England warns of the longest recession since 19](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/nov/03/bank-of-england-raises-interest-rates-to-3-percent) is yet clearly bearish.

My personal guess is that this is a major short covering, fomo pump &amp; euphoria because of the stock market recovering. But that wouldn’t be a reliable fundamental strength. Crypto does crypto things and can decouple at any moment again - yet it’s refreshing to see some green.

I'm curious if this is just another short lived bear market rally and It'll dump back down the next weeks if not next days already. But this kind of hopium &amp; buying feels really refreshing. What are your thoughts? Just whales feeling more confident to throw some money into alts or is it yet another short-lived bull trap?",cryptocurrency,1667537300

- global debt is at about 300% of gdp.  If interest rates even go to 8.3%, that's 25.2% of global gdp just to pay the interest

- everything bubble has been popping and will continue to pop

stocks,Recovering from the TRIPLE punch down of a beark market. Let's do it together.,"You loss a massive amount of money. The big names out there who are professional investors loss their ass betting wrong. Nothing worked this year. Bonds, stocks, shorts... everything got squeezed down and up in the extreme movements we have been witnessing.

Example/illustration of what I mean by TRIPLE punch down. On Oct-Nov of 2021 the COVID brrrrr cash inyected in the stock market, creating a bubbly, peaked. Bubble burst. But it was only the start.

I am using ARK ETF as it has been the leading indicator of what it was to come to the entire market later, including big names such as MSFT, GOOGL, META and AMAZON

[Triple punch](https://snipboard.io/FPXZ4J.jpg)

Basically: In Jan 2022, everyone thought.... this can't go further down...this is the bottom. Cathy Wood is already crying. Come on!

In Summer 2022: We were ""well... now this was a over-correction, an abuse by the market...this is the bottom. FED PIVOT coming""

And in the last 10 days it has been like: ""Holy shit... is there a bottom? How far this can keep downtrending?"" 

No one has made money here, generally speaking. So even if you had your bets on the safest MSFT or GOOGL, you are now terribly down! Margin Calls everywhere if you were leveraged.

Let's talk about recovering:

We have the biggest opportunity NOW to take positions in safe businesses that have a great management, product, business model and margins. Avoid the ones who are still FCF negative after all or flooding the market with new shares (dillution) to pay tech-employees.

There are companies with low P/E ratios that have a very robust business and are down -50%, -60%, -70%... So to recover the peak, they will do minimum +100% from here. That 100% will help you recover the losses. And when that bounce happens it will happen very quickly. So you don't want to start timing now, that's stupid. 

Are you happy to discuss and share strong companies here?

US Market: GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT and I'd include META as its core business is not worth just the below 10 P/E its trading at... come one. 

UK Market: Homebuilder companies as they tend to not bear any debt ;-)

Germany: Industrial focused companies as they are the world and europe leaders

I can give further details of these if I see interest and a good debate ongoing on this proposal.",finance,1667556989

stocks,Picks for covid high flyers that go bankrupt first or pull off a turnaround?,"There have been a number of covid high flyers that are absolutely crushed right now. What are your picks for companies that could be bankrupt within a year? Any you think could turnaround?

&amp;#x200B;

For bankruptcy, Carvana is knocking on Chapter 11's doorstep. Revenues are dropping, sales are down, gross profits are down (Q3 was $359M), and their Q3 earnings were the most negative in their history (-$200M). The value of their cars will continue to drop as recession fears and interest rates rise and the chip shortage abates further lowering gross profits. And most importantly, with a $316M in unrestricted cash, their Q3 adjusted EBITDA was -$200M, which doesn't even include their interest expense which is almost half of their gross profits (they have a net debt of \~7B). I'm watching this one closely, so that I can buy a car when they have to liquidate.

&amp;#x200B;

My pick for turnaround is controversial. I'm going with PTON. I don't own any shares in them btw, but I've been following out of interest. Their CEO is doing an amazing job restructuring the business, all of the hard decisions on cost cutting have already been done, and managements plans for expanding the TAM, opening new product lines, and offering more affordable options like allowing their software on 3rd party platforms, rental equipment as a service, and making their app freemium, has potential to expand growth once they've stabilized. It's still high risk, but I've been impressed with how quickly they've moved and their creativity.",finance,1667558356

personalfinance,"My 2008 Toyota Rav4 needs thousands in repairs, and I don't know what to do...","So here's the lowdown. I'm 4 months ($780) away from paying off my 2008 Toyota Rav4 Limited. I've been looking forward to taking that extra, monthly cash and decimating the rest of my student loans ($10,000 or so). 

However, I took my car in for an inspection on Wednesday, and there's A LOT wrong with it; left front control arm, sway bar, drive shaft, rear brakes and rotors, and body work to repair rusted rocker panels. My best guess is I'm looking at around $4000 in repairs if I can buy the parts myself and find someone to slap it together., or $7,000ish if I go to the dealer and know the job was done right. (I have $2,500 in savings.) I should also mention I'm scared of pouring that much money into the vehicle and, where it's so old, having to put thousands more into it in just a year's time.

KBB has my car listed anywhere between 4 to 8 thousand dollars. (It has leather seats, JBL sound system, moon roof, roof rack, weather tech floor mats, etc.) 

I have a lot of options, but don't know what to do. As it sits, I could probably get 4 grand out of it. (Carmax quoted me 5, but I bet it'll be less when they see the extent of repairs.)

This is the worst possible time to have to buy a vehicle as interest rates are crazy and vehicles (even used) are being sold well above MSRP.

Leasing seems to be out of the question as I don't have enough cash on-hand for the down payment, and I could only afford a monthly payment of $200-$250.

My wife has a 2017 Subarau and has suggested we go down to one vehicle, but that introduces a number of headaches in trying to juggle who has the car (and when) for work and such. 

I'm just wondering if there are any options I've overlooked, or what everyone here thinks I should do?",finance,1667561755

I've joined the mortgage prisoner club as my attempts to refinance since July 2022 has been denied by all the lenders and I don't have any other option than to suck it up the higher repayment until the tightening cycle ends. I know in the long-term offset account clearly outperforms a HISA. However, in the short-term to cope with the rise in interest rates, what are your thoughts of parking your savings in a HISA instead to generate additional income to compensate for the increased costs.

We will have roughly 115k from the sale of our home when all fees are paid. That's in addition to a 30k cash/emergency fund. We would like to buy a house at 300k or less in our new city. At the top of our budget, that's a monthly payment of 1950/mo if we put 20 down. 

One way we could keep the monthly payment comparable is to pay more than 20% down. Is that a good idea for the sake of our monthly cash flow?

I know ideally we will be able to refinance, but the uncertainty of when we can do that makes me want to lock in the lower payment by paying more now out of the equity of our sale.

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

UPDATE 29-10-2022

As Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

stocks,Intense tax-loss selling will derail end-of-year stock market rally...,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/bond-king-jeffrey-gundlach-says-any-year-end-stock-market-rally-is-going-to-be-derailed-by-intense-tax-loss-selling/ar-AA13IgsG?cvid=ff56328691474cb28d1237ea16d81dcf)

 

Any potential year-end stock market rally will be at risk of sputtering out due to tax-loss harvesting opportunities, according to DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, he said he is skeptical of any year-end rally because ""everything is down."" 

""There are so many losses to be harvested in every category. The only thing that is up year-to-date is the dollar and commodities. That's it. And the only thing that is up since the Fed started going to 75s \[basis point rate hikes\] is the dollar,"" Gundlach explained.

Not only are stocks down big so far this year, but bonds are too thanks to the Federal Reserve's aggressive interest rate hikes.

 So most investors, whether they own stocks or bonds, should have plenty of opportunities to harvest losses between now and the end of the year. And that means there will be more selling pressure ahead.

""There will be pretty high tax loss selling I would think. I even got a white paper from somebody saying this was the greatest tax loss selling opportunity of a generation. I would say it might be two generations,"" Gundlach said.

Tax-loss selling is a tax optimization strategy that investors and financial advisors often take advantage of in taxable accounts heading into year-end. The strategy involves realizing losses by selling out of losing positions, and then buying back those portfolio positions 31 days later to avoid the tax wash-sale rule.

The strategy allows investors to realize losses that can offset future realized gains, ultimately helping reduce tax liabilities in the long term.

With some widely held stocks like Meta Platforms and Amazon down big year-to-date, investors may be waiting until after the tax-loss harvesting period ends at the start of next year before rushing in to buy.

In the meantime, Gundlach recommends investors stick with bonds as they offer a better value relative to stocks thanks to the rise in interest rates.",finance,1667577301
personalfinance,"Mortgage Interest Rate is 5.25, what pay down strategy should we use?","Prior to the recent rate hikes I saw so many posts about not paying your mortgage off early, it was dumb to pay off such low interest debt fast. 

We just bought our house and locked in a 5.25% interest rate, which frankly we feel fortunate it's that low. I was curious about personal finances opinion on what pay down strategy to use at this rate. Currently we are planning on a biweekly pay down strategy, which amounts to one extra payment a year. It saves us $200,000 over the life of the loan.

My last statement has $140 on it, due by Nov 9th. The card in total has $400 on it. 

I can pay it all off now, but ideally I would pay off the $140 statement balance, and the rest later in the month after my next paycheck. I want to do this so I can pay off another credit card that has a due date of Nov 10th. I can’t pay them both off at once. (I am hella broke)

So my question is, if I only pay the $140 statement balance off on the Amex, will I get hit with interest charges for the remaining $260 if I don’t pay that off before the statement period closes on Nov 14th? Or would there only be interest charges if I didn’t pay off the statement balance? It might seem like an obvious question, but I’ve always had trouble wrapping my head around when things happen in the credit card billing cycle. 

My goal was never to pay interest on this card so I’ll pay it all off if necessary and just wait until my next paycheck to pay off the other card. TIA!",finance,1667580928

Used car budget 20k cash out the door. Not interested in another lease. Could do a loan but not until after I'm done purchasing a condo for her, and may not be worthwhile with high interest rates anyway.

Options:

1. Sell/trade in the explorer now. Pro: net $5-6k, save 3k in lease payments. Con: purchasing used at current high values. Ex calculation for cost of a vehicle going forward: 20k purchase - 5k trade in = $15k.
2. Wait till next summer and return vehicle - with used car prices going down, I expect the value will be closer to residual by that point. Pro: probably lower used car prices, con: 3k lease payments, lose out on the equity in the vehicle, which may be offset by lower used car prices at the time anyway. Ex cost of a vehicle going forward: 15k purchase + 3k lease payments: 18k. This is assuming used car prices continue to decline, which I know, no one can really predict what exactly will happen.

economy,Effects of Inflationary Boom/Bust or Deflationary Boom/Bust on the businesses involved in Energy,"This is a abridged post and is a summary of the following four scenarios – 

1. **Inflationary Boom** – increase in prices along with an increase in economic growth
2. **Inflationary Bust or Stagflation** – increase in prices along with a decrease in economic growth
3. **Deflationary Boom** – decrease in prices along with an increase in economic growth
4. **Deflationary Bust** – decrease in prices along with a decrease in economic growth

And how they affect –

1. **Demand for energy**
2. **Investments in energy**

These scenarios occur in varying frequency and sequence over short periods (about 5 years) of time, which combine to form a regime. A regime can either be inflationary (increasing prices) or deflationary (decreasing prices) and can last several decades. The last four decades have been deflationary, and the next four, **appear inflationary**.

  

**Why do the four scenarios matter****?**

Because the change in prices and economic growth affect the rate of inflation, which in turn affects the interest rate, which affects how much money is in the economy. The amount of money in the economy affects commercial and retail borrowing and spending, leading to an increase/decrease in demand for goods and services. **An increase/decrease in the demand for goods and services leads to an increase/decrease in the demand for energy**. 

&amp;#x200B;

**How can inflation and economic growth be tracked****?** (A few examples)

  

1. **Headline CPI** – measures the rate of change of inflation on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis
2. **Rent Inflation** – comprises 32% of the headline CPI
3. **Services Inflation** – comprises 57% of the headline CPI
4. **Import Prices** – rate of change in the prices of goods and services purchased from foreign sellers
5. **Producer Price Index** \- measures price change for commodities sold for personal consumption, capital investment, government, and export
6. **Chicago Fed National Activity Index** \- is designed to gauge overall economic activity and related inflationary pressure
7. **Capacity Utilization** \- used to measure the rate at which potential output levels are being met or used

 

**Why are we heading to a regime change which will be inflationary****?** 

**Let us begin by quickly summarizing the disinflationary drivers of the last 40 years** – 

1. **China** – the country managed to bring over 600 million people into the workforce and out of poverty. This helped improve their lives but also provided cheap labor to the global economy. At the same time, China laid the massive manufacturing and logistics infrastructure which has made it the manufacturing powerhouse that it is today
2. **Collapse of USSR** – led to the migration of cheap labor from Eastern Europe to Mainland Europe
3. **Outsourcing** – exasperated with high inflation from the mid 1960’s to the mid 1980’s, developed economies willingly accepted the idea to outsource or offshore their manufacturing to China
4. **Immigration** – the same reason stated in point 3 led to developed economies opening up to immigration from developing economies which led to wages being driven down
5. **Debt** – Increase in debt (through monetary policy) led to businesses running on the loss-making model as well as increased competition
6. **Technology** – the ultimate disinflationary driver which made the World smaller, expedited exchange and execution of ideas, gaslighted innovation, and increased efficiency exponentially

**Now let us understand which of the above disinflationary drivers can slow down or turn inflationary** – 

1. **China** – demography is getting older and wealthier and labor-intensive industries such as apparel and footwear are moving to Vietnam and Bangladesh. Also, it could be possible that new disinflationary drivers such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, and India can fill in the capacity of China.
2. **Outsourcing** – many developed countries have elected or are electing populist governments that promise to bring back the jobs by reshoring their industries. Also, Covid lockdowns and the Russian – Ukraine conflict has shown governments how globalized supply chains are vulnerable and de-risking supply chains to some extent by localizing them would be a strategic necessity.
3. **Immigration** – again, many developed countries have elected or are electing governments that promise or have a mandate in place that caps immigration which would cut off access to foreign cheap labor and talent.
4. **Debt** – many developed countries are running debt to GDP ratios in excess of 100% and any increase in debt through monetary policy would be a very unpopular opinion among the population

**And the new drivers of the Inflationary Regime?** 

1. **ESG** – The transition to Net Zero involves a large negative supply shock and mega capex
2. **Inequality** – the disinflationary regime of the last 40 years worked in favor of the capitalists against the labor, and the monetary policies in place since 2008 exacerbated this inequality. The current inflationary period will put pressure on governments to work on closing the gap in inequality, which will further increase pressures on inflation
3. **Fiscal Policy** – governments are already putting money in the hands of the people so that they can weather the inflation or are providing subsidies. Fiscal policy is proven to be inflationary.

&amp;#x200B;

**As this is an abridged version, I have briefly listed the reasons for my base case of an inflationary regime. I believe that we are currently in a stagflation environment and may either remain in a stagflation environment for a while or alternate between an inflationary boom and stagflation.**

**Having said that, I would like to briefly mention a few of my thoughts or rather, my musings. Will post these musings in a Part 2 Post as this post is already long.** 

**Will update this post with the link to Part 2 when I post it.**",finance,1667584054

As we can see during the first two we were even in a bear-market-rally like situation. It is also surprising that stock markets actually made a lower low during that period of four rate hikes, also did a few other asset-classes. So why did BTC and actually of all of crypto hold it off relatively well?

There is a short answer to this and an eternally-long one. The short one is: Well crypto is not the stock markets so economical events wont be the big driver here but mass adoption or technological updates will. But it’s just not as simple as crypto has been seen to indeed care about more stock market topics like the CPI data, FED and just today the unemployment rates. Over all obviously we still have a correlation to stock markets even if it has declined.

To end it here, Crypto is showing that its not just a copy of the stock market, as we in comparison hold off pretty well against a 3% rate hikes in 140 days, but Crypto is also about its own principles and having a lot of mass adoption even in a bear market is surely a good one.

Let’s say someone had a $600k mortgage at 6% interest and is in the 32% marginal tax bracket. To make it simpler let’s say it’s just one payment a year so that would be $36k interest for the year.  
  
The standard deduction is baseline, but SALT and property taxes will probably already get past that.  
  
For the 32% marginal tax rate and $36k additional to itemize, that’s $11.5k saved on taxes. If subtract that from the payment, we get $24.5k/$600k = 4% effective interest rate.  
  
Actually we don’t even need the loan amount. 6% interest and we save 32% of that so it would be 4.08% effective. This holds through the life of the mortgage. Is this something to consider for early mortgage payments?",finance,1667586119

When I get the money I am going to get I-bonds since the interest rate is so high right now. Also I will not be able to purchase a house till atl least 2027 when I finish residency. I will also need to have roughly 100k loans on med school left because a lot of employers offer that much payback if you have debt. Any advice would be good since I have never had any excess money and this is new to me.,finance,1667587279
CryptoCurrency,I'm no better than the crypto fear &amp; greed index.,"I could’ve bought a Tesla with the money I lost in the last bear market.

I had crypto fever. The future of money was a divine revelation to me. Cryptocurrency had its blessing from all my idols:  Elon Musk, Bill Gates, Tim Draper, and the Google founders. Techno-chauvinism was my church, and Elon Musk my saint. He still is, of course.

The narrative was sexy. Billions are unbanked. Central banks are defunct. People don’t trust the government. Payments haven’t kept pace with digital transformation. I loved it.

I wasn’t a blind convert. I looked at the data and listened to the experts. They had a consensus: Web3 and blockchain were the future. Invest in blockchain now- it’s like investing in the internet in the 1980s. It’s going to explode. You’re smarter than the masses- get in early.

I did. I didn’t have a house to bet, but I had enough cash for a Tesla. If I played the game right, that money could become a house. In the distant future, maybe a private jet. Insanity.

The fear and greed index then? 76. Bitcoin’s price? $39K.

The shitshow began. I spent a hot interval listening to YouTube quacks on repeat. Could this many people be wrong?

Bitcoin went to $68k later in 2021. The fear and greed index went to 84. 

My only regret was that I hadn’t bought more. Wasn’t that line in the movie *The Wolf of Wall Street*? Fuck. It didn’t turn out well for that guy. But do you guys follow him on social? His wife is hot.

Elon loaded Tesla’s balance sheet with Bitcoin and looked like a genius. I loaded my portfolio with Bitcoin and felt the same. My doubts came when Bitcoin tanked. 

“Always ask yourself: how could I be wrong about this?” I recalled an annoying business school professor asking us.  He was chairman of the New York Federal Reserve. Was I wrong about Bitcoin going to the moon?

If blockchain is the future, why aren’t more people using it? Why am I paying 5% fees to Coinbase? Why does it take 10 minutes and $60 in fees to send my Ethereum to my hardware wallet? Warren Buffett calls Bitcoin ""rat poison squared"". The media, never letting a good hysteria slide, fuels whatever flames burn- green or red. 

The fear and greed index sunk to 6. Bitcoin sunk to $18K. My Tesla cash turned into Kia cash.

I was too greedy. I thought myself smarter than everyone else. All was speculation, of course. There’s a difference between sound investing, and gambling, which is about chasing dopamine hits the same way that an alcoholic drinks. 

It taught me that I’m not above the masses’ emotions. I don’t know what’s going to happen with cryptocurrency. I’m an emotional creature like everyone else. 

A simple fear &amp; greed index isn’t going to fix our problems. But the index is a gauge of how the world is feeling about cryptocurrency. This time, I'm paying attention.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: I built an interactive fear &amp; greed index chart on my blog. Check it out:

personalfinance,"Getting a €10.000 government grant soon, parents say to pump it into student debt but I don’t think that’s the right choice?","Hello,

I am looking for advice on the best action. So I’m 22 years old and I still live with my parents currently and I am in my final year as a student. I will receive a 10k government grant soon, and I am not sure what I should do with it.

Once I finish my studies, my debt will be about 30k. This debt can be paid off over 30 years with an interest rate of very close to zero (it used to be zero but changes this year due to inflation). This debt only really has repercussions on getting a mortgage, which I am not planning on getting any time soon considering I’m on my own and since even without debt I cannot get one high enough to afford a house.

My parents want me to just immediately pump this money into the debt. However, as the interest is so low, since I can pay it off over such a long time and since it does not really have any repercussions, is this not just a waste? I do not really need the money at the moment, so I was thinking of just letting it grow somewhere, but what would be the best course of action for that?

Thanks in advance for any advice!",finance,1667589871

personalfinance,Student Loan Repayment Planning Questions,"Hi all,

With  the recent announcement of changes to the federal student loan system  and hopefully lots of forgiveness on the horizon, I thought I would  start planning out my longer term goals for my loans. I'm sure many are  in the same boat as me so I wanted to make a post and ask my questions  to see what the community thinks and hopefully others can benefit from  this post as well.

Mostly everyone  is familiar with the $10,000/$20,000 forgiveness that is pending, but I  wanted to review the rest of the changes and see how that will affect  payments on remaining balances. I have copied and pasted the part of the  announcement in question for reference here (source: [https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement](https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement)):

**Part 3. Make the student loan system more manageable for current and future borrowers**

Income-based   repayment plans have long existed within the U.S. Department of   Education. However, the Biden-Harris Administration is proposing a rule   to create a new income-driven repayment plan that will substantially   reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers.

The rule would: 

* **Require borrowers to pay no more than 5% of their discretionary income monthly on undergraduate loans.** This is down from the 10% available under the most recent income-driven repayment plan.
* **Raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary income and therefore is protected from repayment**,   guaranteeing that no borrower earning under 225% of the federal  poverty  level—about the annual equivalent of a $15 minimum wage for a  single  borrower—will have to make a monthly payment.
* **Forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments**, instead of 20 years, for borrowers with loan balances of $12,000 or less.
* **Cover the borrower’s unpaid monthly interest**,   so that unlike other existing income-driven repayment plans, no   borrower’s loan balance will grow as long as they make their monthly   payments—even when that monthly payment is $0 because their income is   low. 

So my thoughts and questions are the following:

1. How is discretionary income determined?
2. If  the unpaid monthly interest is covered, is it in everyone's best  interest to get the lowest possible monthly payment? Should everyone  apply for the income-driven repayment plan if that reduces their  payments enough that the unpaid interest is covered?
3. For  anyone single person making $30,577.50 annually or less (225% of the  2022 Federal Poverty Level), there will be no monthly payment. Will any  payment they make go directly towards the principle since the unpaid  interest will be covered?  
Federal Poverty Levels can be found here: [https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/federal-poverty-level-fpl/).
4. What are your thoughts on how these changes will affect or should affect how people plan to repay their federal student loans?

Thank you!",finance,1667592321
personalfinance,Buying Bonds Because Yields are High Right Now?,"As I understand it, because of rising central bank interest rates, yields on bonds are running at historical highs, particularly US Treasuries.

I'm relatively young (35) and my risk tolerance is relatively high, but I am strongly considering putting some money in bonds right now because if yields are as high as they are going to get it seems like a reasonable time to lock in some fixed income for a long duration. Baked into this assumption is the idea that I believe that inflation is going to go down in the near future (1-ish years), so that if I buy a bond with a 5-7% yield while that won't beat inflation right now over a longer term it should have yields over inflation.

Put another way: If someone is selling me a 10 year bond with a 7% yield, which is historical stock market returns, that seems like a pretty ROI as long as inflation comes down below 7% relatively soon. Equities might make a better return over that timeframe, but assuming that I can stomach the risk associated with the bond (e.g. the bond holder defaults) it seems like a pretty good ROI to lock in.

Does this logic make sense? Am I thinking about the problem incompletely? Should I be investing in a bond fund rather than a particular bond?",finance,1667593091

solar,Battery economics - can it make sense?,"Looking to get a system installed, and I am being quoted €5,400 for a Huawei Luna2000 5kWh battery.  


My electricity supplier charges €0.32 per kWh, and pays out €0.14 per kWh that is fed back into the grid. So the difference is €0.18 per kWh.  


Let's say the battery is charged and discharged every day of the year (365 x 5kWh = 1,825 kWh).   


So in ideal circumstances, I'd be using 1,825 kWh over the course of a year from the battery.  


Then, multiply that by the difference between self-use and selling back to the grid (1,825 \* €0.18 = €328.50).  


The savings per year would be €328.50.  


So the payback period would be more than 16 years.

Can Anyone help?,"I currently have my solar system installed, but it failed the inspection because the engineer did not have my electrical system listed properly.

Here is my current electrical setup.

-	Main Service Panel - 225A Busbar

-	Feeder Wires - 2/0 CU (Connects Main Panel to Sub Panel)

-	Sub Panel - **No Main Breaker** (it gets fed from the 200A Main Service)

Now that we’ve established that, we’re having issues confirming WHERE the solar needs to be installed in my system.

2.	Option 2 - Main Breaker (200A) &gt; 2/0 CU Feeder Wires &gt; Sub Panel (Loads) &gt; Solar Breaker (70A)

To confirm, the Main Panel and Sub Panel Busbar ratings are both 225Amps. I thought the 70A Solar needed to be added at the furthest distance away from the Main (Option 2)…but the Engineer confirmed it could be installed in the main (Option 1).

&gt; Stocks rallied on Friday, but finished the week lower, as investors drew conflicting conclusions about what the latest payroll numbers mean for future Federal Reserve rate hikes.

&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 401.97 points, or 1.26%, to close at 32,403.22. The S&amp;P 500 advanced 1.36% to settle at 3,770.55, and the Nasdaq Composite rose 1.28% to finish at 10,475.25.
*****
&gt; All the major averages capped off the week with losses. The Dow shed 1.4%, ending four weeks of gains. The S&amp;P and Nasdaq fell 3.35% and 5.65%, respectively, to break two-week winning streaks.
*****
&gt; October’s nonfarm payrolls report on Friday left investors divided, fueling some concern that the Fed will persist with its hiking campaign since the labor market added 261,000 jobs. Others interpreted the findings as a sign that the labor market is beginning to cool — albeit at a slow pace — since the unemployment rate rose to 3.7%.

*****
&gt; Investors in recent days have struggled to decipher comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell regarding whether a tightening pivot may come as the central bank fights to tame rising inflation and a strong economy. Focus also shifted toward next week’s consumer price index report. A drop in inflation could signal rate hikes are doing their job and fuel a potential shift.

&gt; # On the Other Hand

&gt; Harry Truman is famous (among other things) for saying, “Give me a one-handed Economist. All my economists say 'on hand...', then 'but on the other...” And it's true. You rarely will see an economic analysis that doesn't couch one view with an alternative scenario, and you can't fault them for hedging their bets. Predicting the future is impossible, especially when it involves the direction of the world's largest economy.

&gt; This morning's employment report also has a number of hands. At the surface, the report was better than expected coming in ahead of expectations (261K vs 193K). As shown in the chart below, this was the seventh straight better-than-expected print and the ninth in the last ten months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110422-Actal-vs-estimates.png))**

&gt; To illustrate just how impressive this recent run has been, the chart below shows streaks of better-than-expected prints in non-farm payrolls (NFP). The current streak of seven is easily the longest such streak since at least 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110422-Streaks-of-Better.png))**

&gt; While job growth in the US economy has consistently surpassed expectations this year, it is important to point out that the pace of job growth isn't accelerating. This month's print of 261K was actually the smallest monthly increase since late 2020 and is well off the peak readings seen in 2021 when the FOMC was maintaining its zero interest rate policy. To put this trend in perspective, in 2021 the average monthly change in NFP was 562K. In 2022, that average has declined to 407K, and in just the last three months, the average has been 289K. On the one hand, the job market remains strong. On the other hand, momentum has clearly peaked and there has been a trend of deceleration.

&gt; # The Silver Lining of Another Fed Rate Hike

&gt; The Federal Reserve (Fed) just raised rates by 0.75%, taking the federal funds rate to a target 3.75-4.0% range. This is the 4th consecutive 0.75% interest rate increase and comes as the Fed tries to get on top of inflation. The bond market has been anticipating this aggressive pace of tightening, and treasury yields have moved in sync. Short-term yields are a gauge of what investors believe is the path of monetary policy over the near future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yields-vs-FFR-600x800.png))**

&gt; The bad news is that markets don’t think rate increases are done, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell more or less suggested this in his remarks. Investors now expect the target policy rate to peak at 5% six months from now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-implied-policy-rates-601x800.png))**

&gt; # So, what’s the positive news?
&gt; Well, interest rates are higher, and that means you can get a greater yield on bonds. And since the yield curve is inverted, with short-term yields higher than long-term yields, short-term bonds are potentially a very attractive option. They have less “duration” risk, in that they’re less sensitive to interest rate changes, especially if interest rates continue to move higher.

&gt; Extremely short-term bonds are more attractive now than they have been in more than a decade and a half. The 3-month treasury yield is currently at 4.2% and the 6-month treasury yield is at 4.6%, the highest yields in more than fifteen years. These “ultra-short” bonds could potentially be used as a potential cash-like solution, especially if that cash is not needed in the immediate future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yield-curve-shift-600x800.png))**

&gt; # But Which Cash Solution?
&gt; I mentioned above that yields have moved up as the Fed raised interest rates. But yields haven’t moved up in tandem across all the different types of savings and short-term investment vehicles out there.

&gt; Savings accounts at some of the major banks are still paying interest rates well below the treasury yields I quoted above. And as the next chart illustrates, money market funds are also paying much lower yields, currently averaging about 2.9%. On top of that, they’ve started increasing fees. As Jason Zweig at the Wall Street Journal recently wrote, not a single U.S. money market fund was charging more than 0.18% in annual expenses at the end of 2021 – as of September 30th, the average expense is 0.39%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-3-picture-yield-changes-600x800.png))**

&gt; CDs offer better yields and are gaining in popularity once again. However, the best rates (4% or more) tend to be offered by banks to their wealthiest customers, so-called brokered CDs which are purchased through brokerage firms.

&gt; The downside of CDs is that they are illiquid, locking up money for a longer period. Moreover, if yields continue to increase, you could be stuck with a CD that pays out a lower rate of interest. Also, CDs are subject to state and local income taxes, unlike treasuries (and funds that hold treasuries), and you also must pay taxes on accrued interest for each year, unless it’s in a tax-deferred retirement account.

&gt; This brings us to ultra-short-term bond ETFs. Now, you must be careful when picking one of these – being aware of the “duration” risk as well as the quality of bonds in the fund, i.e., “credit risk”.

&gt; I combed through the universe of ultra-short bond ETFs and selected 8 that hold treasuries. The table below shows the expense ratios, yields, and effective duration for these ETFs. (Please note that this is NOT a recommendation to buy or sell any of these securities, and you must do your own research before doing so, given your unique circumstances.)

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/11-3-21table-800x459.png))**

&gt; If you notice, there are 3 different kinds of yields listed above. The first two are the 12-month yield and SEC yield, which are typically what’s shown if you pull up a site like Morningstar. These are both backward-looking yields. The 12-month yield is the sum of the ETF’s trailing 12-month interest payments divided by the last month’s ending share price (net asset value) – which is not helpful because interest rates were much lower over the past 12 months. The SEC yield is slightly better since it’s a little more recent – it divides the income received during the 30-day period that ended on the last day of the prior month by the share price on the last day of the period. The problem is the income received can vary from month to month, and it’s still backward-looking.

&gt; The yield you want to focus on is the “yield-to-maturity”, which can be found on the issuer websites, and is best reflective of the future expected return. The average effective duration can also be found on the issuer’s website, and as you can see, these ETFs all have extremely low duration. This means they have very little interest rate risk, even as they offer very attractive yields. And since these ETFs hold treasuries, there is no credit risk (unless the US government defaults). There are plenty of ultra-short ETFs that I didn’t list here which have much more attractive yields, but they do tend to stretch more out onto the credit risk spectrum.

&gt; A couple of interesting ETFs at the bottom of the table (tickers: TFLO and USFR) have practically zero duration risk. These hold “floating rate” treasury bonds that seek to take advantage of rising interest rates – they mature in two years, but the interest rate resets every week when the US Treasury auctions the 13-week treasury bill.

&gt; We believe all these ETFs are fairly attractive options that can be used as potential cash solutions. Ideally, you can tier your cash to maximize the yield – with money market funds used for immediate liquidity needs (say, a week or two) and ultra-short treasury bond ETFs like the ones listed above for longer-term needs.

&gt; The silver lining of an aggressive Fed is that now you can put your cash to work.

&gt; # Typical November Trading Usually Bullish

&gt; After a big October for the record books the first two days of November have taken it on the chin as the market hoped for more dovish comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell. Initial bullish reaction to new dovish remarks in the written statement were countered by tough talk from Powell in the presser. Looked like war of the algos today. Let’s wait for the dust to settle over the next few days to see if November begins to live up to it’s bullish reputation.

&gt; Being a bullish month November has seven bullish days based upon S&amp;P 500, with four occurring on the first four trading days of the month. Although historically a bullish month, November does have weak points. NASDAQ and Russell 2000 exhibit the greatest strength at the beginning and end of November. Russell 2000 is notably bearish on the 12th trading day of the month; the small-cap benchmark has risen just ten times in the last 38 years (since 1984).

&gt; # Best and Worst Performing Stocks Since Rate Hikes Began

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 is down a little more than 12% since the close on March 16th after Fed Chair Powell hiked rates off the zero bound for the first time of this cycle. We've seen 300 basis points of hikes so far, and today we're set for another hike of 75 bps.

&gt; Looking at the S&amp;P 1500, which includes large-caps, mid-caps, and small-caps, the average stock in the index is down 7.1% since the close on March 16th after the first rate hike. As shown below, Real Estate stocks (REITs) have been hit the hardest by the rate hikes with the average stock in the sector down 20.6%. Communication Services stocks are down the second most with an average decline of 18.4%. Consumer Discretionary stocks have averaged a decline of 13.1% since 3/16, while Technology stocks are down 10.6%. On the upside, we've seen two sectors average gains since the Powell rate hike cycle began: Energy and Consumer Staples. Consumer Staples stocks are up an average of 5.6%, while Energy stocks have averaged a huge gain of 24.8%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/avgsector.png))**

&gt; Below is a list of the stocks in the S&amp;P 1500 with market caps above $2 billion that have done the best since rate hikes began back in March. PBF Energy (PBF) is up the most with a gain of 135.99%, while CONSOL Energy (CEIX) ranks second with a gain of 114.49%. Other notable stocks on the list of big winners include First Solar (FSLR), Constellation Energy (CEG), Shockwave Medical (SWAV), Enphase Energy (ENPH), Lamb Weston (LW), H&amp;R Block (HRB), TreeHouse Foods (THS), Exxon Mobil (XOM), and Albemarle (ALB).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/bestperf.png))**

&gt; On the flip side, below is a list of the stocks with market caps still above $2 billion that have fallen the most since the rate hike cycle began. Leading the list is portable generator maker Generac (GNRC) with a decline of 62.45%, followed by two more stocks down more than 60%: Scotts Miracle-Gro (SMG) and Neogen (NEOG). Other notables on the list of rate-hike losers include Under Armour (UAA), Align Tech (ALGN), Meta Platforms (META), Carnival (CCL), Kohl's (KSS), Expedia (EXPE), Cleveland-Cliffs (CLF), VF Corp (VFC), AMD, Paramount (PARA), and Yeti (YETI).

&gt; Stocks usually bottom before EPS, jobs, and GDP start to improve. Time after time we've seen it (but note it didn't work during the Tech bubble). The bottom line, stocks sniff out better times and rally in the face of bad news.

&gt; # Record Decline in Mortgage Apps

&gt; As mortgage rates continue to press higher with Bankrate.com's 30 year national average for a fixed rate loan hovering well above 7%, high frequency housing data continues to show no signs of relief. The latest mortgage purchase reading from the Mortgage Bankers Association released this morning showed the lowest level of applications since the start of 2015. As we mentioned in today's Morning Lineup, that would imply further significant declines in new and existing home sales data to come.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-1.png))**

&gt; Refinance applications are even worse. Given homeowners would be refinancing at some of the highest rates of the past few decades, refinance applications were up modestly week over week, although that is far from enough to lift it off of the lowest levels since August 2000.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-2.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, purchases tend to peak in the late spring followed by a gradual decline through the end of the year. While mortgage activity has fallen off of a cliff this year, the drop has followed the usual seasonal pattern. What is amazing about this year is just how large of a drop that has been. Whereas 2022 started with purchase apps coming in at some of the strongest levels of the past decade for the comparable weeks of the year, the opposite is true today.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-MBA-3a.png))**

&gt; Although purchases have followed their seasonal pattern, the chart above does not do justice in showing how large of a decline it has been off of the annual peak. It has been nearly half a year (25 weeks) since applications hit their seasonal high, and in that time, purchases have been essentially cut in half. Relative to the 25 weeks after each other annual high since 1990, 2010 was the only other year in which there was a similar decline. However, that year comes with a caveat that the expiration of special homebuyer tax credits lent to a particularly strong home-buying season. Similarly, a change in mortgage disclosure rules in the fall of 2015 resulted in a seasonal peak occurring unusually late in the fall of that year, so 25 weeks later extended out to the following year. Given that, purchases were actually higher in the 25 weeks later; the only year in which that is the case. In other words, caveats aside, no other year in the history of this data has seen as sharp of a decline in homebuying/mortgage origination activity as this year.

&gt; # Large Cap Growth Underperforms Everything

&gt; The past year has been a rough road for equities, but growth in particular has certainly seen its fair share of underperformance. The past month especially has been a notable microcosm of that underperformance. As we approach the one-year mark of the last all-time high in growth-oriented indices like the Nasdaq (discussed in today's Chart of the Day) or S&amp;P 500 Growth index, large-cap growth's relative strength has broken down versus equities broadly, as well as growth and value across various market cap ranges.

&gt; As shown below, S&amp;P 500 Growth relative to the S&amp;P 500 steadily moved higher (upwards trending lines indicate S&amp;P 500 growth outperformance) throughout the post-Global Financial Crisis era and absolutely took off in the early stages of the pandemic. After peaking in November of last year, the relative performance of growth has been on the downswing and erasing most of its earlier pandemic outperformance. In fact, following the historic weakness of mega caps on earnings (which we discussed in last week's Bespoke report) that has continued into this week, and the relative strength is now at the lowest level since the end of February 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-VG-1.png))**

&gt; Large-cap growth has not only underperformed other large caps, but it has also dramatically underperformed its mid and small-cap peers. From the post-Dot Com Bubble years through the Global Financial Crisis period, large-cap growth serially underperformed growth stocks of both the mid and small-cap varieties. The past decade, however, erased much of that underperformance. In fact, the 20-year relative strength line of S&amp;P 500 growth versus S&amp;P 400 growth actually turned positive briefly earlier this year in February. In other words, after almost two decades the performance of large-cap (S&amp;P 500) and mid-cap (S&amp;P 400) growth was finally near equal. Since then, the relative strength line has pivoted sharply lower and is now testing the uptrend line that has been in place since 2016.

&gt; Relative to small-cap growth, large-cap growth was much weaker in the first half of the 2010s and didn't really begin to turn higher until the past five years. With that said, it also peaked far earlier (September 2020) than the relative strength versus mid-cap growth and is not quite testing its multiyear uptrend line yet.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110222-VG-2a.png))**

&gt; Where the more dramatic underperformance of large-cap growth has been is relative to value stocks. As shown in the first chart below, relative to large-cap value, large-cap growth generally remains in its longer-term uptrend although most post-pandemic outperformance has been erased. Moving down the market cap chain increasingly worsens that picture through. The relative strength line of S&amp;P 500 growth versus S&amp;P 400 value recently hit a new low for the post-pandemic period, nearing the flatline in the process. In other words, large-cap growth has almost erased all of its outperformance versus mid-cap value, not only since the start of the pandemic but over the past 20 years. As for small caps, that outperformance is now gone entirely gone as the relative strength line now registers negative readings. Both versus mid and small-cap value, large-cap growth has definitively broken its multi-year uptrends that had been in place since late 2016.

&gt; # Record Inflow into High Yield (JNK)

&gt; High yield bonds proxied by the third largest ETF tracking the space, the SPDR Bloomberg High Yield Bond ETF (JNK), went on a solid 3% run last week. That ranks as the fifth best performing fixed income ETF in our Trend Analyzer. That resulted in the ETF to close above its 50-DMA for the first time since late August. Today, the ETF has reversed those gains and is hovering slightly back below that moving average.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/10/103122-JNK-1.png))**

&gt; Although from a technical standpoint that could mean Friday's breakout was a pump fake, the move was backed by near record volumes hence a record single day inflow. As shown below, roughly $980 million went into JNK on Friday, surpassing the previous record of $774 million set this past January. While total assets have been on the downswing for the past couple of years leaving plenty of room to go until the ETF is back up to its size from its peak in the summer of 2020, that single day inflow did put an impressive dent in those recent outflows.

# Risk Analysis - Statistical Analysis

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 2002 to 2022, we have the following data:

|Expected Minimum Return|0.16%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|0.26%|
|Standard Deviation|5.07%|

Taking in count the stock's price movement from 1st December 2021 to Today, 5th November 2022, we have the following data: 4739

|Expected Minimum Return|1.09%|
|:-|:-|
|Variance|1.72%|
|Standard Deviation|13.11%|

&amp;#x200B;

Statistically Speaking, investing in GME has a high probability to give you a return around -5 and 5%, with 43.46% of the data population between -5% and 0 and 45.94% between 0 and 5%.

This gives us a 10.60% chance to get an outlier return from the historical data. 

Standard Deviation suggests a 13.11% to ride on a price movement higher than 5% or lower than -5%. In the long run the chance of getting outlier is reduced to 5%.

# Final Comment

With its current amount of Cash &amp; Cash Equivalents and without any drastic changes in the company structure and business model, GME is expected to burn is cash within 35 Months. Taking in mind receivables and other liquidity, it still have 39 months remaining in operation.

The company can avoid this by taking more loans or selling parts of the company and other assets.

Company doesn't pass Acid Test, and it is in a dire financial struggle to survive.

Still expecting negative income and cash flow from operations for 2023.

Debt is not critical, this shall allows some room for a possible long term loan.

Current Cash can cover only 94% of current liabilities. The company should be able to cover it with receivables.

ROE, ROA, ROIC and ROC terrible.

ROE is in recover, so GG

ROIC worsen and ROA is stable

This suggest that, yes the management is trying to fix the company, with some positive outcome, but they are struggling a lot right now.

Income quality getting away from danger zone, but still in bad situations.

Gross profit margin worsened. Company cannot manage well costs, this is probably due to inflation and macro.

There are ""***Strategic and Operational Risks Related to Digital Asset Initiatives""*** *that can have huge positive impact as well as dire outcome if it fails. This is a huge risk factor.*

In the mid term, 1-2 years, the company shall gradually trade down from current price to $15 with possible spikes due to external factors. Expect (90% chance) movements between -5% and 5% cause historical price action with a 10% chance to cash in or go tits up.

Fundamentals point toward bankruptcy, but as for now, if the management play their card well there is a possibility to recover.

With current balance sheet, market  health and macro, the company is fucked up.

bonds,buying t bills from Treasury direct,"when I signed up for an account at Treasurydirect.gov I went to the buy page. and on the buy page there was a chart for which week of the treasury that you want to buy, the duration, and the amount you want to buy by dollar amount.

so for example you could choose a 4-week treasury bill, that goes on auction on November 10th, 2022 (to be issues November 20) and the dollar amount is self-enter, so you can put down like $10 or $100.

i didn't hit enter because i wanted to know what happens next.

if I tried to buy this particular treasury bill, with let's say $100 worth. what actually happens next?

I am expecting that my bank account would be deducted $95 or something immediately, and then it would be put back with the full $100 4 weeks from November 20th. is that correct?

also, why do they call it an auction? it doesn't let you put in a bid. in fact, it doesn't even show you the interest rate. from what I can gather, you have to look at what people are paying for treasury bills previously in order to guesstimate what you might get.

investing,It's been a costly endeavor to find financing in the speculative grade bond market,"“Carnival Cruise Corp. recently completed a $2 billion high-yield bond offering at a 10.75% yield. Single-B rated Carnival used 12 of it's vessels, with a total appraised value of more than $8 billion, as collateral backing the debt. ""Without the ships, I don’t believe that they would have access to  capital at a price they would have been comfortable with,” John McClain,  high yield portfolio manager at Brandywine Global Investment  Management, told the *FT*.

""Indeed, it’s been an expensive proposition for companies looking to  finance themselves in the speculative-grade bond market. Borrowers that  have come to market this month have paid an average all-in yield of  12.25%, data from LCD showed yesterday, the highest since 2009. All but  one of the eight deals that have priced in October featured double digit  yields, a 87.5% share, compared to 31.4% during the third quarter and  just 1.4% in the first three months of the year.""

Private equity companies, large suppliers of debt financing during normal times, have begun funding buyouts as large as $2 billion through strict equity deals with no debt financing in place. Richard Farley, partner at law firm Kramer, Levin, Neftalis and Frankel, told Bloomberg that ""They don’t want to be locked into very expensive debt if they think they  are going to have access to the debt market at more attractive rates in  a short period of time.”

""What if markets don’t cooperate? Private equity-sponsored firms account  for roughly 80% of the single-B-minus rated cohort of speculative grade  credits, Moody’s analyst Christina Padgett found back in May. That  ratings category represents a quarter of the broader sub-investment  grade universe, double the pre-crisis population. More broadly, 60% of  junk bonds and leveraged loans are rated single-B and below, compared to  about 40% during the previous buyout boom’s peak in 2006."")-*Almost Daily Grant's 10/20*

While private equity can have positive impacts on firms profitability, growth, and capital expenditures during normal economic times, can they exacerbate market downturns? Given that PE sponsored firms account for nearly a quarter of all sub-investment grade credits, had deal-making during the time of rock-bottom interest rates gotten sloppy? 

A quote from a paper titled ""Private Equity and Financial Fragility During the Crisis"" written by professors at Northwestern finds the following, "" Looking across multiple market cycles and geographies, Axelson and co-authors (2013) explore one of the above considerations. They show that the use of leverage in buyouts has little to do with the underlying characteristics of the companies themselves, but rather are driven by changes in credit conditions in the broader economy. These periods of high leverage are associated with higher transaction prices and lower subsequent returns, suggesting that private equity investors over-leverage and overpay when access to credit is readily available. Moreover, the increased level of activity during booms may translate into an inability to effectively monitor and fund their portfolio firms during economic downturns, as witnessed by the lower relative rates of productivity growth by private equity-backed firms during these periods (Davis, et al, 2014).""",finance,1667618807

investing,The market used to be uncorrelated with interest rates. Now it is inversely correlated. What changed to make interest rates almost the sole determinant of the market's trajectory?,"I would like to understand the relation between the stock market and interest rates. It used to be that the stock market was independent of interest rates. When rates increased, the market could rise or fall. When rates fell, the market could rise or fall. Since 2008, however, it seems that the only thing that determines the direction of the market is the trajectory of interest rates. If rates fall, stocks rise. If rates rise, stocks fall. Stocks *cannot* rise if rates are rising. And they *cannot* fall if rates are falling.

Why?

Why can't the market ignore the Fed and trade normally? Why don't we have more normal trading days where 30% of stocks rise, 30% of stocks fall, and 40% of stocks don't move?

Can we return to a time where stocks can rise in a rising rates environment? Can we return to a time when stocks can fall in a falling rates environment?

I'm not disappointed that stocks are down YTD. I think most stocks are still overvalued.

But aren't individual stocks supposed to be traded based on investor sentiment and the fundamentals of the underlying business, not just interest rates?

What happens if the so-called ""pivot"" doesn't come? What if the Fed keeps raising rates by 25, 50, or 75 bps for years? A decade? Can investors learn to live in an environment of permanently high rates and see equity gains in such an environment?",finance,1667621755
investing,"Outside the United States, a 2008-style housing related insolvency crisis looms","I am not a doomer, but I am a Canadian and I know that countries outside of the United States of America do not usually have fixed rates for mortgages for any term beyond 10 years. If they exist, the rate is very far above shorter mortgage terms. In Canada, 10 year fixed mortgage rates have doubled (from 2.99% to 5.94%) from the lows in 2020 to the current rate. 30 year rates are almost unheard of. [The only 25 year fixed mortgage is offered by the Royal Bank of Canada and is currently quoted at 9.75%.](https://www.ratehub.ca/best-mortgage-rates/25-year/fixed)

Because of a long term downtrend in interest rates between the early 1980s to 2021, personal finance subreddits like r/PersonalFinanceCanada as well as people in real life have recommended for decades that borrowers choose variable mortgages. Those mortgages have rates that fluctuate based on the [Bank of Canada's key interest rate, which has gone up repeatedly in 2022.](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/core-functions/monetary-policy/key-interest-rate/) Mortgage contracts require that all borrowers must pay all of the interest due even if the principal is not being paid down at all. When interest rates rise substantially, the amount that a borrower is paying may not be sufficient to pay off the interest and as such, payments go up, sometimes by [$2000 a month](https://vancouver.citynews.ca/2022/10/26/surrey-man-home-high-rates/). Unless a borrower was very frugal and has very high income, this is a financial disaster.

Now, we know that inflation is very high in a lot of countries (except China and Japan, in bot cases due to severe population aging and for China, draconian lockdowns severely curtailed economic activity). [Despite wages going up nominally, they have not kept pace with inflation.](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221104/dq221104a-eng.htm) In 2008, it took only a small segment of borrowers defaulting to bring down the housing market in the US, and in 2023, it will also only take a very small number of borrowers defaulting in the [fastest rate hiking cycle in nearly 50 years](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/comparing-the-speed-of-u-s-interest-rate-hikes/) to bring down multiple housing markets and clog up the court systems with personal bankruptcy cases.",finance,1667623619
personalfinance,What should I do with my saving ? Investing or Down Payment for Mortgage,"Hello everyone. I would love to get some help from this community about my future purchases. Here is quick explanation of my situation. 

- I been able to saved up $35k by working at the restaurant and being frugal for a year. I stay in rental property, it’s a studio unit and I pay for $1100 monthly. Its only me but place is very small for me. I need a bigger place tbh for my business that I want to grow (i will explain more about my business in second paragraph) 

-I have my online business going on for over a year. I’m doing very good on that, my sales and profits are good I have customer base already to shop with me so its really time to slowly grow on that business. 

-I have a decent credit (close to 800) and been pre-approved for mortgage of $250k. Im looking for smaller condos/townhouses with 2 BR with garage. My budget on that is $100k-$175k. With the higher interest rates, hoa fees and other expenses, Im looking at $1300-$1500 monthly payments everything included (of course, this is without any maintenance expenses for home) 

Which option makes more sense in my situation, you guys think ? 

Option 1 : Putting 30k down for a mortgage and get myself a bigger condo, keep working hard at other job and being frugal some more and grow my business at the end.

Option 2 : Rent myself a one or two br apartment, and put my most savings for my business (buying more products for my inventory and spending on marketing)

ethereum,Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing,"Ethereum is notorious for being prohibitively slow and costly. At the height of cryptocurrency's most recent hype cycle, something as simple as exchanging one token for another on the blockchain could have cost upwards of $40.  


It's no surprise that L2 protocols have grown in popularity, so there are layer 2 rollups for those who want to keep their transactions within the Ethereum ecosystem, and there's a reason why Metis and other L2 solutions have become so popular.  


Layer 2 rollups have special systems in place to ensure that transactions aren't spoofed or altered before being sent back to Ethereum's main chain, which is pretty cool.  


In what L2 protocol do you believe the most, and what fascinates you about it?  


Did you know that the total value locked in Ethereum's Layer 2 networks has surpassed $5 billion? Ethereum's Layer 2 ecosystem is undeniably growing.  


Although the Ethereum Merge was the second-most anticipated blockchain update this year, Ethereum supporters have long hoped that Layer 2 growth will help the ecosystem achieve mass adoption by lowering costs and making the network more accessible.

CryptoCurrency,The NY Fed's Statement Shows It Is LYING and DESPERATE To Push CBDC's Over Crypto In a Losing Battle,"The NY Fed [latest statement](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/04/cbdcs-could-reduce-fx-transaction-speeds-to-10-seconds-ny-fed-says/) shows it is absolutely desperate to have the next step of finance be supported by CBDCs and not crypto. And their desperation shows they know they are fighting a losing battle. The Fed said that CBDCs could reduce forex transaction speeds to 10 seconds. To determine this they tested the speed of FX transactions using distributed ledgers. Now we **know** CBDCs are centralized as that's what they ""C"" stands for, yet they say they tested the system using a distributed ledger. We *know* that the Fed plans to hold absolute power over the ""ledger"" so there's no way that they would actually implement a truly decentralised ledger, so I don't know what the point of this test was, if only to beguile the masses into believing they are doing something that they are actually not. *Conveniently*, the Fed did not provide many details about how the simulation was conducted or how they confirmed transaction settlements.  They even outright state that the project is intended to research the benefits of wholesale CBDCs .We should also note that ""transaction speeds"" are very far from transaction clearing or settlement which actually determines the transaction validity and accepts it into the payment system.

This is analogous to the White House crypto report where they admitted the failures of the banking system, such that around 31 million Americans are left out and then they go on to announce the FedNow system which is an interbank clearing system which has absolutely nothing to do with getting more citizens into the financial system. It's a constant game of smoke and mirrors, ploys at gaining and retaining control with no tangible benefits for the people. And again that cross-border payments perform horribly but a system to solve this exact use case like Ripple's is actively crushed through the judicial system by the SEC and given no notice or second glances.

With the absolutely massive wave of adoption and coming regulation the government will have no choice but to accept crypto, and probably insodoing, the fall of fiat as well that strips away much of its power and control. And we'll all be here for it.",cryptocurrency,1667658443

We bought a house a year or two ago (30 years, historically low interest), and we pay ~30% more than required monthly. We bought a car and also pay about ~30% over monthly payment.

Our savings:
I opened a savings account and started to put some money aside, but the interest rate is hilariously low.

We have an emergency fund that will sustain us for a couple of month.

We both pay the retirement thing with our employers (sorry, have no idea what it’s called), and we set the % to what they are matching.

Our financial situation:
In the end of the month, if we didn’t have any extra spending (something unexpected or some big purchase), I have about 3k left.

We both work full time and our free time is fully devoted to our kid (1 yo), so any financial advice that will require actively handling money won’t really work in our setup. I also believe the recession will happen soon, and we need to prepare somehow, but I really don’t know what to do about it. Any advice is welcome, and US specific options will be highly appreciated",finance,1667662382

personalfinance,I need help with Regions Bank…,"Recently, it appears that Regions Bank has modified their accounts for customers who have not changed anything or given permission to make such changes on their accounts. 

To speak about this specifically, Regions used to have 3 options to waive fees on their accounts, even if it was only 1 type. 

First question, 
Does anyone know what type of account this was called? Any online document as proof? 

The options were, have 500 or more in your account for any month, make 10 transactions, or have direct deposit set up. 

It appears they have done a scum bag move in the sense that, they have removed the multiple options, from their accounts. 

The phone staff will not admit to such changes, &amp; even lie about how long they have been working for Regions, as if their false claim is to overrule a person’s own lives experience. 

What kind of help I am looking for, besides the above question, is to find proof of the old policy online, as I mentioned above. 

I would also like to know what avenue I have available to me, including disputing monthly fees &amp; such charges, &amp; the like. 

I also want to know to which Federal agency do I report such violations to with regards to Regions? Like, I want to get them in trouble, &amp; force them to reverse their changes, to which their representatives will not admit to. 

I’m looking for help in proof, that my account with Regions Bank, was changed, from the policy it had for years, to be changed with out my knowledge. I want to make them regret their choice to fuck over customers in this way. 

I am aware of the recent court decision against Regions. I highly expect that the court ruling is what made the changes to Regions Bank accounts. As a way for them to gain some of that money back.

CryptoCurrency,Can your favorite cryptocurrency work in a degrowth economy?,"Recently I have been watching some videos from anti-capitalist anarchist Andrew Sage, including the recently released [How Degrowth Can Save The World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQrI2GBvn5Q).

If we are talking about reduced energy use, Proof-of-Stake is often advanced as a solution. However, the POS reward system has perpetual growth baked into it's [very design](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/rewards-and-penalties/). Stakers are always rewarded some percentage or their stake, ostensibly to compensate them for securing the network. (I feel it is a payment for holding capital.) The only way to ""win"" as a non-staker is to invest in some venture that will yield a return on investment; perpetuating economic growth. I will get into why the stakers may not actually come out ahead below (See ""Capital intensive Layer 2"" discussion).

Many Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies have a tapering coin emission schedule that is roughly supposed to emulate the expense of mining minerals. A deflationary cryptocurrency should be ideal in a degrowth economy. Unfortunately, many of the popular ones have an extremely constrained transaction capacity. This means that any drops in hash-power have to potential to disrupt the network: with long confirmation times and high fees. ""Big Block"" forks of Bitcoin do not have this problem. Notably XMR has an automatically adjustable blocksize (miners give up a portion of the ""tail emission"" if larger blocks are needed).

Capital-intensive layer 2 protocols, like the Lightning Network, may not be helpful in a degrowth economy. If FIAT ever becomes deflationary^1 , the relative interest rate of the capital needed to hold open lightning channels may skyrocket. You may see large hubs closing down in order to invest the capital in FIAT currencies instead.

personalfinance,Should I move from Current Bank to Huntington Bank?,"Context below, but I put a TLDR just in-case cause it ended up being a little lengthy...

Right  now I am using Current Bank (Choice Financial Group) and for awhile  have enjoyed the service. But today, I have hit a snag that points out a  very glaring issue with Current. They have terrible customer support,  and zero phone number to call. You either use the app, or email them,  and wait...

I have been  considering going to Huntington Bank for awhile now that I am back in  Ohio and live less then a mile from a decent branch. Also, for context, I  have been getting my life back in order. I am a recovering addict who  is now finally starting to become stable and actually making a somewhat  live-able wage ($22/hr salary) the past couple months with an extremely  great job with lots of potential for me to finally start living  independently. At the beginning of the year I started working IT for an  Auto Group, but they paid me garbage ($13/hr) and didn't wanna give me a  raise and let me go because the owner didn't like paying the IT team.

The  director let me go as a favor because he knew it wasn't gonna go  anywhere so I could find a better job at an MSP. Well, I did, but at the  time I had signed up for Current Bank because they offered $100  overdraft without fees and encouraged its use. I saw it as a tidbit of  credit I still can't get because I have a terrible credit score that I  am only now finally having the ability to start working at.

Between  the time I got let go and was looking for a new job, Current disabled  my overdrive. Completely understandable and fair. No direct deposit, no  overdraft bonus; however, starting mid September I got my new job and  have got consistent Direct Deposits back on the account literally  depositing near TWICE what I made at my previous job. So, a few days  after my first DD, they confirmed eligibility and re-activated my  overdrive. GREAT! Now I got a buffer while I pay back my parents, my  behind car payments and insurance, so forth. But today out of nowhere,  they disabled it saying I am not eligible until ""I make a direct deposit  of at least $500 within the next month"". WHAT?! I already have been  making direct deposits exceeding $1,500 for the past almost two months  now, and was already approved back at the beginning of October and  haven't had a problem since, making consistent bi-monthly direct  deposits.

I decided to contact  support and ask them what's going on. All I get is the boiler plate  response I quoted above, and when I pointed out I have been making  consistent direct deposits for almost two months now, the agent tried  saying I haven't made a direct deposit since June 16, 2022 (This is  wrong, my last deposit until getting laid off was June 20th, 2022). This  is wrong because my last deposit was three days ago.. So I provided  them with screenshots and copies of all the direct deposit receipt  numbers since the end of September to confirm I have absolutely been  eligible and making direct deposits since then, but then they back  peddle and try to say I need to have been making direct deposits since  July - September and haven't made a deposit since then, telling me I  need to provide proof I got deposits then, ignoring my current direct  deposits.

Every time I corrected  them and requested elevated support, they would give me the boiler plate  response and ask me if there is anything else they can help me with. I  am so beyond fed up that I couldn't at least speak to someone directly  or speak to someone who actually has any ability to help. It made me  realize if this is how it's going to be, I would rather move back to a  real bank I can actually speak with a human being over the phone, or an  actual branch in person to discuss issues. Not get copy-n-paste  responses ignoring all the facts. I enjoyed my overdrive service because  it helped protect me, but I am realizing it is a terrible cushion to  depend on anyways and just encourages me to overspend...

TL;DR  - Should I move onto a real bank like Huntington instead of neobanks  that offer overdraft services without fees? I like the no-fee overdraft  with the ability to spend over my balance, but this is probably a bad  habit right?

retirement,"For Buy and Hold Investors, what was the alternative to Bond Funds during 2010-2022 when interest rates were near 0?","My family member retired early this year just as the markets tanked. Not only did his stock ETFs get slaughtered, but his ""safe"" bond fund ETFs also fell 10-15%. All the bond funds were those typical total market bond funds the experts recommend with durations of 5-7 years.

In retrospect, it seems to me somewhat silly that anyone would have invested money into bond funds with medium/long duration during the 2010-2020 timeframe, given that interest rates were near 0. My assumption is that interest rates could only go up, and when they did, the bond funds would would only go down. I suppose it is possible that interest rates could have gone negative, which would have made bond funds go up. It's happened in other countries. 

It seems to me that back in 08-10, when the Fed announced it was going to drop interest rates, it might have been smart to start moving out of these medium/long duration bond funds and to park the money somewhere else. Such as cash, short term CDs, short term T-bills, or short-term bond funds.

Of course, you would now have the opposite problem today, interest rates are rising and you have to figure out how to time the market to move your money back into medium duration bond funds.

I'm a buy and hold investor. I don't really like the idea of timing the market or making changes based on market conditions. But I suppose I might include interest rates as somewhat of an exception. I don't really know.

I suppose I am not very sold on these bond funds. It seems to me a 5 year treasury bond ladder would be a simple solution instead of risking major losses in a bond fund ETF when interest rates rise.

personalfinance,CD Ladder or Recast Mortgage?,"Hi All-

Curious what others would do in my situation.  I bought a new primary home and now about to sell my current place and move.  The new mortgage is at 3.25% interest rate (bought it in 2021 and have been renovating).  My current place will yield $600k (after taxes).

I plan to replenish/increase my emergency fund with $200k.  And the remaining $400k I had always planned to use to recast the mortgage.  This recasting would save me about $1800 per month in cash flow. 

Question is whether it makes more sense to hold onto the cash for a bit, earn nearly 3.25% or more in interest  or investment income for the next year or two and see how things pan out with my income, of which more than half comes from a performance bonus.  I guess I am a little nervous about my earning potential in a recession.  That said, long-term, I am optimistic that my income potential will grow.",finance,1667685558

So far, I have yet to directly pay taxes to any source; I receive my income via direct deposit, and my district payroll always automatically withholds the federal income tax amount before completing the deposit.

investing,I know nothing. How is Carvana not a buy here?,"I am no investing genius, but I have been in the automotive industry for 30 years.  Supply and demand seesaws back and forth.... finance rates go up and down... but more people, more drivers, and demand to replace vehicles that eventually will age out will ultimately push both new and used car sales back up.  It is inevitable.   Supply chain issues will be resolved, manufactures will keep pumping at new inventory,  then when they are sitting on overstuffed lots they will need to offer rebates and financing deals.  So maybe new car sales surge again and for awhile used car demand drops in favor of new....etc... but that assumes buyers can afford new car prices in the long haul even with special rates and rebates.  I believe as the middle class continues to vanish, wages stay flat and new car prices keep soaring... used will still be big business in the long run.

CryptoCurrency,Canada: Credit Card (VISA &amp; Mastercard) Surcharge,"For fellow Canadians that may be unaware, Canadian merchants processing payments through VISA and Mastercard are allowed to charge a surcharge to customers. The fee already exists in [many US states](https://financialpost.com/fp-answers/fp-answers-surcharge). The fee can be [up to 2.4% of the purchase cost](https://www.cbc.ca/news/credit-card-surcharge-faq-1.6610356). This can add up quickly - if you buy $1000 of ETH a surcharge could see you spending $24 just for using the card.

While it’s not guaranteed that you’ll pay 2.4%, if you pay using a premium credit card, then the fees can be on the higher end.

Of course there aren’t many Canadian crypto exchanges, now - but that will likely change in the coming years. [Binance is improving their standing with regulatory bodies](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/12/29/binance-to-continue-operating-in-ontario-after-cooperating-with-canadian-regulators/) and it’s a [matter of time before a wide variety of options are available to Canadians](https://cryptopotato.com/cryptos-rapid-growth-pushed-canada-to-speed-up-regulations/). Additionally, official opposition at the federal level is lead by pro-crypto Pierre Poilievre, so the next election cycle in 2026 will see crypto having a dominant part in debates. However, sooner still is the reading of [Bill C-249](https://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/bill/C-249/first-reading) to see that Canada takes a central role in crypto markets.

Using Interac (has lower fees than credit cards) or buying crypto when your exchange has 0% fee promotions could be very useful in maximizing you money into crypto.

So, all indications are saying that crypto will have a more dominant role for Canadians, regulations are being developed quickly, and using a credit card can see that you’re paying more in fees (more than you might already pay). Seek out the lowest cost options (of course) and utilize promotions to DCA.

As such, I’m leaving most of my cash on the sidelines expecting (hoping) for things to crash even more.

It got me thinking though, defi and NFT mania kicked off the last bull run along with the money printer going brrrrr, so it lead me to wonder- what will spawn the next bull?

Will it be a play to earn like Stepn or Sweat? Will it be layer 2s exploding due to increased TVLs and way cheaper fees? Will it be increased adoption regardless of where we are on the regulatory front? Or will it just be time? Just having the patience to sit back and wait since we know the Fed isn’t going to stop jacking up rates anytime soon?

Personally, I think the layer 2 roll up narrative will drive the next bull and I’m looking forward to how coins (including ones not out yet) like Matic, OP, Arbitrum, Zksync, Metis, and others perform. I got into crypto in the beginning of 2021 and got excited for how easy it was to make money. Then learned how easy it was to lose it by not taking profits.

My first bear mistakes are hopefully out of the way and I’m ready to do better next time around!

stocks,$ASTS DUE DILIGENCE | HUGE LONG TERM POTENTIAL | DECENT SHORT TERM POTENTIAL,"Hello everyone.  


I'll cut to the chase.  
100x by 2030.  
2x by May 2023.  


Lets start.

# BREAKDOWN

&amp;#x200B;

**WHO –** Avellan Space Technology and Science.  
 

**WHAT –** Building satellites that can connect to unmodified cellphones and other IoT devices.  
 

**WHERE –** Technology is being developed in Midland Texas but services will be available all over the world where regulators permit.  
 

**WHY –** Cell towers are profitable for population-dense areas, many places do not have enough population density or infrastructure for cell towers.  
 

**HOW –** ASTS satellites will operate as relays or cell towers in space.  


# RISKS

&amp;#x200B;

1. Technology does not work - If ASTS Blue Walker 3 (BW3) final demonstration satellite fails to unfurl or connect to devices on the ground then the company will be in deep trouble because they wont be able to test their technology.
2. Unfurling of the satellite - Expected to unfurl around the 10th of November. If the satellite fails to unfurl then the technology cannot be tested.
3. Backhaul antennas do not work as intended - Technology cannot be tested.
4. Funding runs out - I'll get into this later.
5. Low level competitors - Oneweb, Project Kuiper, Iridium etc. They all need dishes or special equipment and will not be able to provide the level of service ASTS will be capable off and therefore they are not a concern.
6. High level competitors - Starlink (NOT SPACEX), Apple, lynk etc. They are planning to do something somewhat similar but they claim that their technology will only be capable of doing text messages and perhaps voice calls in the future.
7. Regulatory risks - Sorted out by ASTS partners, the MNOs (Mobile Network Operators).
8. Legal battle risks - ASTS has a patent moat and there's been an increase in the amount of competitors joining the race. Patents are insured by lloyds of london.
9. Newly signed MNOs do not have exclusive MoUs.  


# STRENTHS AND OPPORTUNITIES

&amp;#x200B;

1. First mover advantage.
2. 2400 patent and patent claim moat.
3. Expert Board of Directors.
4. Cult-like investor following.
5. 1.8B+ potential subscribers under MNO MoUs (Memorandum of Understanding).
6. High margin business - Expected margins expected to be 90-95%.
7. No need to own spectrum - Spectrum is super expensive.
8. Bigger satellites than the competition - Physics dictate that better = better if you want to connect to normal phones on the groun.
9. \~25 MNO partners - Competitors dont have this.
10. Classified mission upon completion of commercial testing of BW3 (Private DD suggests defense use case).
11. 50/50 Revenue split - MNOs do the billing, customer acquisition etc. ASTS just sells bandwidth with a wholesaler model. 

   10. BW3/ BB1-5/ BB6+/Starlink Gen 2 sizes in meters.  
7x9/7x9/20x17.8/5x5  

Okay so we've got facts, now lets get some analysis done.  


If the technology doesnt work then ASTS should have enough funds to launch its Blue Bird satellite and conduct some testing on that.  


The satellite is partially unfurled already and that unfurling happened when some very specific factors all happened at the same time. Namely a spy satellite within range of the BW3 satellite, over a gateway among some other factors.  


Backhaul antennas look like they use a motor or servo so there shouldn't be any issue with them.  


Funding runs out - I WILL GET TO THIS LATER I PROMISE.  


The competitors - Starlink is a competitor to traditional MNOs which makes it unlikely for them to receive many partnerships, they need partnerships for the spectrum.  
Apple has a deal with GSAT for an emergency text service but apple can't face MNOs head on because the MNOs will promote android instead.  
Lynk - poor and crap but their satellites connected to phones on the ground. They wont be able to compete against ASTS once ASTS is up.  


ASTS has a first mover advantage in this space. Their satellite is in space.  
Huge patent and patent claim moat, this is a roadblock to those competitors.

Their board of directors, I cant post images but there is an infographic that really shows it well.

Cult like investors - Check your twitter and the ASTS subreddit if you dont believe me.

Lots of **potential** subscribers under the MoUs. Important thing to note is that a lot of potential customers aren't subscribers because there is no coverage where they live. It will take time to get those customers signed up and using the service.   
Not all potential subscribers will sign up for the service, primarily those that live in cities.

MNOs have to buy spectrum so ASTS wont need to.

  


# FUNDING

ASTS has around 200m in cash, is burning around 40m per quarter and expects to pay \~16m per satellite.  
They need 20 satellites to finish their phase 1 constellation.  
I estimate that they need 400-500m in financing.  


Below is separate DD I conducted into ASTS financing which was specifically written for people currently invested in ASTS  
Q2 ER part of a transcript below.

*Griffin, Scott here. I'll take that one. So I think first off,* ***we continue to believe that we qualify under a prospective 5G for America FCC fund****. Details on that have not been released, but still in process, but we continue to believe that we qualify for that based on the rule making from a little while ago, and that's an opportunity for us for sure.* ***And globally, there are similar types of funding available****. We haven't talked about those specifically. But generally speaking, I'd say our message and our story has been pretty well received. And there are -- apart from grants, there's also* ***government-supported debt that's available.*** *And so I think* ***our story continues to resonate well with governments, with regulators.*** *And importantly, as we get closer and closer to a launch, and we delivered a satellite to Cape Canaveral, seeing that satellite,* ***seeing the tangible milestone has been very powerful with a lot of different audiences.*** *But we continue to believe we qualify for that prospective FCC fund, but we're in a wait mode there.*  


 1. Management believes they qualify for the FCC rural 5G fund. I'm not sure when we will receive information whether ASTS will be awarded any funds from that.   
 2. Globally there are similar types of funding and interestingly enough ASTS has offices all around the world including within the EU. I'll be nice though and assume we dont win any funding or grants.  

3. Government supported debt. There is debt available.  My guess is as good as yours but I assume this debt depending on the interest rate will be available if BW3 is a success. 

 4. ASTS story resonates well with governments and regulators (plural). Remember this is cutting/bleeding edge technology. ASTS needs to prove themselves.

 5. Stakeholders want to see BW3 work, they want tangible results. Why bother with more risk when you can get less risk? Why help ASTS when they still have to prove their tech works when you can just wait to see the tech working. 

 6. Updated S-3. If ASTS was planning on diluting to finance the first phase of their constellation then why bother filing a new S-3 which gives the company significantly more flexibility when it comes to funding? 

 7. Dilution hurts Abel more than anyone. Dilution hurts the CFO making these decisions re: financing. Nobody in the company wants dilution.  

8. Strategic investors/MNOs. AT&amp;T's CEO has stated that they believe they're ahead of all competitors. I'm not sure if he meant  Whether it is just the technology that is taking them ahead or if they're completely ahead in the sense that they believe they will be first to market but it is still important. 

 9. Multiple ASTS MNO partners have started selling of tower assets. Perhaps this is being used to pay down their own debts or perhaps some of it will be available to ASTS. Remember that those companies have to do what is best for their investors. 

 10. It is in the best interests of the MNOs partnered with ASTS to ensure that ASTS survives. If ASTS is making 5B then that means the MNOs are also making 5B, this is not chump change.   

11. Some MNOs have great views on how the technology is progressing.  If those MNOs who have engineers helping ASTS, those same MNOs that will be conducting testing WITH ASTS dont believe the tech will work then it was all a pipe dream. But we don't believe that because we have no reason to. 

So my message to all those who are worried about dilution, take a chill pill. If the company does dilute, my estimates put dilution at 15-50% of the current float.  50% of a 100x is a 66.67x. Does that sound like a good deal to you? 

&amp;#x200B;

There is honestly so much more information but I cant fit it all in here.  
I have a link to much more comprehensive DD.  


Alternatively feel free to simply ask a question and I'll do my best to answer it.  


To those who think it's too risky to invest in ASTS.  
Come back in April, by then testing should be complete and financing secured.

CryptoCurrency,Why all roads lead to Bitcoin and why fiat yield farm investors will be exit liquidity for central bankers,"The US currently has a debt to GDP ratio of around 130%. Historically, the risk of default if debt to GDP of a country is above 100% is 98%.

That means the US has a 98% probability of default.

If you don't believe this check this out:

(You can't fight gravity)

[https://i.redd.it/96sby0ax60b71.jpg](https://i.redd.it/96sby0ax60b71.jpg)

[https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1575132870418567170](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1575132870418567170)

There are two roads to default.

A) Official default. If that happens the global financial system would collapse. In such a case you absolutely want to hold portable, hard to confiscate assets with no counterparty risk. Road A leads to Bitcoin.

B) Unofficial default, a smarter road to default. In this case the Fed and other central bankers suppress interest rates below the rate of inflation while debasing their currency. This is also called financial repression. In this case bond holders/creditors never get their original investment back(after adjusting for inflation) even though the US did officially not default on their debt. The US will likely choose this option.

In that case you don't want to hold fiat yield farm coins(government bonds) while the Fed dumps USD on you Terra-Luna style (their size really is size).

Don't forget that Terra had to print always more of their coin to support their yield product UST. In this case the US dollar is Luna and government bonds are UST, the unsustainable yield product.

1 USD will always be 1 USD so it can't lose it's peg unlike UST but it will lose it's peg against all other goods when the government has to print like crazy to continue to pay out yields to USD debt investors. The dollar will be sacrificed like Luna to support the government's yield product but investors will still lose a lot of their money after adjusting for monetary inflation.

Boomer governance tokens(stonks) might be a much better option but they are already overvalued and if there is sustained high monetary debasement the economy will hurt and so will stonk earnings.

What you want in that case is an asset that can't be debased and that is not a fiat derivative. Road B also leads to orange coin.

Alternatively, the unproductive yellow rock that needs a bigger fool buyer (gold) also looks attractive but if it does really well our digital tulip banker poison² coin would likely do much better.

Central banksters will of course hope that people hold on to their fiat bags as the bag holders help undo the mess they have created losing their personal savings. That's why they will want to convince people that gold is a terrible investment and bitcoin is going to zero while they gradually devalue the dollar towards zero.

They will also want to convince people that all problems are socio-economic, geopolitical or whatever but never due to monetary policy itself.

Many will fall for it because government bonds are presumably risk-free and some entities will have no choice as they will be required to hold bonds in their funds or on their balance sheet.",cryptocurrency,1667730971

We are now debt free amd have excellant credit. Family, especially my father, have been pushing us to buy a house in our low-medium COL area. We haven't had luck finding anything that will keep our total housing expenses (PITI, utilities, etc) under 25% of our gross without eating up money with repairs. My father insists that buying a home is a ""part of building wealth"" and so an adjustment to our ratio leading to slightly less savings is NBD. Other advice we've received is even with interest rates where they are, rent will keep increasing and at minimum a fixed rate will stay the same with the (far-fetched at the moment) option to refinance to get it lower. I think all of this advice ignores what we can afford.
On a feelings level, I want to agree with them. We're sick of renting. In our area rentals are generally bad or expensive. There isnt a medium. At the same time feelings don't save money and we need to be aggresive to catch up. So who is right? Everyone on some level?

bonds,Questions on Timing the Peak of Interest Rates,"Let's say you had a lump sum of cash that you wanted to invest in bonds, not stocks, and a crystal ball that could predict the future. The best course of action is to wait for interest rates to peak and then invest in the longest duration bonds you could find.

But you don't have a crystal ball. You do however have the Fed. For the last year the fed has been telling us that it will continue to raise interest rates until inflation has been reduced to the 2% target. 

Let's say the fed came out tomorrow and said ""ok inflation has been defeated and the economy is now in a recession so we are going to start dropping interest rates"".

What happens to yields on bonds as soon as the fed says that? Do they immediately plunge, or do they just start to move down slowly?

My guess is that they start moving down pretty slow. At that time you can invest the lump sump into bonds, which would essentially be the peak.

Am I totally wrong? Do yields plunge immediately when the fed comes out and says that they will lower interest rates? I assume everyone else has the same idea as me and will start bidding up the prices/lowering the interest rates. Will this happen to such a degree that interest rates will immediately plunge?",finance,1667751052

What year did you find out about crypto? 

How has it changed your view on the world? Finances? Economy? 

Do you speak about crypto openly?

Would love to hear your stories for better or worse.


Personally I’m known in my circle as the crypto guy since 2013. 

Bitcoin changed the way I look at my money, finances, inflation, monetary supply, governments for the better. In school we aren’t taught about money and finances. 

In western society we are for the most case privileged compared to 3rd world countries who had governments for the most part destroy purchasing power through central bank debasement. People are waking up due to Covid and history is a good teacher. Betting on bitcoin is buying long term puts on the Fed continuing to print money and devalue it over time. It is the best asymmetric bet for all of society.

I’ve sadly learned not to speak about crypto unless someone brings it up, or can have a mature conversation about practicality, use cases, finances, economics, currency and more. 

In bull runs “friends” connect with you and in bear runs they run away and some may even scold you. 

I always encourage those that may be interested to do their own research and take the time to understand each project.

I personally lost large sums of crypto back in 2014 (Crypto exchange owner fled) and 2022 (Celsius). It can happen to veterans in the space. Not your keys not your crypto. Losing that crypto and opportunity cost has effected my mental health. However I am to blame and will rebound from my mistakes .

The most important person you can trust is yourself and cold storage (and even then implement good security and don’t get careless). 

We’ve all been impacted in some way with crypto. The most important thing is sticking with it during the good and bad times. Especially the bad times such as now to add for the future. The best thing is to have a plan and take profits during euphoric phase. To combat even our own greed. 

I still believe in crypto to revolutionize the world and transition us into the digital age. We are still incredibly early, and in 5,10 years you will be rewarded with your patience and fortitude.",cryptocurrency,1667753193
investing,Lets take a look at cash / savings statistics,"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT

On the average, the typical US Citizen saves 7%. However, COVID19 caused a massive change in behavior, causing savings rates to skyrocket to 20+%. As we come out of COVID19 however, the savings rate has overcorrected and collapsed to under 4% the past few months.

I'm not quite sure what this bodes for investors. But it just seems very odd to me in general. I understand the savings rate coming down from the 20%+ ridiculousness, but 3% is near the absolute lows in our history.

------

I also was looking into savings accounts / MMFs, to try to get a sense of how much cash is sitting out there.

* https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TLAACBW027SBOG

* https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MMMFFAQ027S

* https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-investments-by-fund-category/

We can see the big jump in savings in March 2020, as COVID19 happened. I guess the good news is that as a society, our banks are pretty stuffed still. But I guess I was expecting more savings / more cash to be held as interest rates rose, and the stock market dropped by 20%.

------

I'm not sure if I'm going anywhere with this, aside from it all being somewhat unexpected to me. Given all the tech layoffs and recession talk, I guess I was expecting ""more fear"" in the market. But I'm barely seeing any at all. It could be that some of these statistics are a bit slow to report (the MMFs is quarterly and last reported Q2 2022). But the savings accounts / savings rate is also lower than I expected.",finance,1667753869
personalfinance,How to calculate investment using borrowed funds?,"Earlier when fed rates were still low I locked in a fixed 20yr loan at 2.50%

The money has been sitting in short term treasuries.

We already max out our ira, 401k, hsa, have a 2 yr emergency fund, did I Bonds out to 2024, and have no debt besides this loan and a 15 yr mortgage at 2%. 

My idea was to take out the loan (done), hold it, and if treasuries went to a certain rate (undecided) then I would invest the total amount. 

We are two incomes and live off the lowest income. We will work for another 14 years.

On treasuries I read interest isn't compounded, and is paid out every 6 months. I believe dividends are taxed as ordinary income.

How do I calculate what the 20 yr treasury rate needs to be for this to be worthwhile? What is this calculation called?

Is this a dumb move if yields are high enough? Something else I can do that is low or lower risk?

personalfinance,Is it worth it to move EF to a different HYSA for a slightly better rate?,"Currently my EF is about 33k in a HYSA at Discover Bank. Chose them originally because I have a Discover CC (that I pay off every month) and online service is quick and easy.  Like most, they have been increasing rates every month lately and just moved up to 2.75% APY for Nov. But, I've seen other banks at 3%, or I think it was Ally offering an additional 1% if you open a new account? Wondering if it is worth it to move the money for an increase of 0.25%?

I am hoping to buy in late summer of 2023 at the earliest so locking funds in for a year does not make sense. My only concern is when I go to purchase a home or if interest rates change, are there fees associated with closing the account? There is no minimum balance required so I suppose I could leave the balance at zero, but in your experience are there hidden fees like this when you go to close the account? I have banked with a credit union my entire life and I've always been skeptical of corporate banks.

stocks,Economic Events This upcoming week,"**Tuesday Nov 8th, EIA STO Report**

The Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) provides the U.S. Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) near-term perspective on energy markets. Each month, the STEO provides forecasts through the end of the next calendar year for consumption, supply, trade, and prices across major fuel types. In addition, the STEO provides in-depth market analysis for crude oil, petroleum products, and natural gas markets. Although its emphasis is on U.S. energy markets, the STEO also includes forecasts for certain international liquid fuels markets. 

Here's a snippet of the last STO report giving us guidance on gasoline prices. Yes they did know about OPEC + production cuts by the time this report came out.

**Wednesday Nov 9th, 10 year note auction**

This is important because the 10 year notes are most closely associated with mortgages and consumer loans and economic sentiment. Higher yields generally mean less demand for these bonds.

To get a look at how these rates have been moving, here's a picture for you.

Initial Jobless Claims measures the number of individuals who filed for unemployment insurance for the first time during the past week. This is the earliest U.S. economic data, but the market impact varies from week to week. 

So as long as this number stays low, you can argue the job market is still strong. The picture shows the trend based on the last few months, and it's really been going down from June to August numbers

Friday Nov 11th, Consumer Sentiment Report

Consumer sentiment is exactly what it say it is. It's a measure of consumer sentiment done by the University of Michigan and they essentially create an index number that is measuring against a base year. In 1966 of Q1, the index number was established at 100. As these index numbers decline, it means consumer sentiment is falling.

So why is this important? Well what is the key component in GDP? GDP is made up of four segments: Consumer Spending, Business investment, Government spending, Net exports

Here's a picture showing how much consumer spending makes up in relation to GDP

[GDP Q3 2022 Unchained](https://i.postimg.cc/fWXDRcLb/image.png)

If you look at the right side at the unchained dollars (adjusted for inflation)  20.021 trillion in GDP and of that amount, 14.149 trillion was consumer spending. So yes, consumer sentiment is important.

CryptoCurrency,Most people underestimate how much money they need to retire with crypto. But I did some calculations.,"Some people underestimate cost of living and overestimate value medium amount of money (few hundreds thousands dollars) have. For most of us $50k or $200k are a lot, but they wouldn't visibly change our lives that much in long term, even if we like to pretend otherwise.


For the sake of  my calculations I mean person in the age of around 25/30 years old, someone who graduated college or university just few years ago and is still single, with no kids, renting with no own home yet, maybe with some cheap car. Person that after retirement would need money not for 10 years, but rather 50 years. If you are already 60, with adult children, wife, car and home you will obviously need less to retire than someone that just start their life journey.

Average student debt in US in 2022 is $37.358 according to US federal reserve. In 2021 average british student debt was £45k, so even more. Not everyone have student loans, but many people here do, especially since Reddit  community is in big part american. To retire you obviously need to pay your  average ""$30 or $50k"" student loan, maybe even few times more if you decided to be a doctor or engineer especially if you chosen some top uni. But that's not all. What about your second half? If you marry their debt concern you too. And your future kids? You obviously want also to  pay  for their education. That mean x2 or x3 times more money.

Obviously almost everyone here want their own home too. Average house price in US is $348k in 2022, average house price in Great Britain in july 2022 was £292k and in  France in 2022 €270k. Ofc home or apartment in expensive state as New York or California or some european capital like Paris or London can cost few times more. Even if you don't want your own home rent is expensive too. Average  rent of two bedroom apartament in US cost $1295 and average rent of family home $2495. Add renovations, taxes and bills and that's  $1k or $2k monthly more...at least. Especially with rising energy prices. Not even mentioning other expences like new fridge, washing mashine or some furnitures every few years.

Phone and computer. Average person use phone 2 or 3 years ( on average 2.5 years according to some semiofficial data) That mean 20 or 25 phones  more you will buy for yourself in your life. Few less if you are not using phones much, few more if you are known for often broking phones accidentally. Computer can live bit more, 5 maybe 7 years, but still you will need 5 or 8 new computers. Multiple  both phone and computer  numbers of you want kids.

Rising one kid for 18 years cost $310k according to calculations of US Agriculture Departament from 2022. That mean two kids cost $620k, not counting college or university and some money for better start in the life than we had.

Travels? Everyone want to travel especially after retirement, week or two every year is at least $1k or $2k yearly if you travel alone and localy. Much more if you travel 2 or 3 times a year with whole family all around the world.


Health insurance, if you retire you either pay it yourself or possibly pay crazy money in case of medical emergency.


Hobby? Being retired and doing nothing is boring. It also mean social  death of many people especially if you are still young. You like painting, playing golf, reading books, building LEGO constructions or watching stars? Average hobby  will cost few k a year if you are financially responsible.


Car? Average new car price is $47k in 2022 in the USA. You can buy used car, but still it is $10k or $20k for good quality car. You change car every 5 to 15 years depending on conditions. That mean 5 or 10  more cars in your lifetime with one car in your family. Two cars mean double expences.


If you are 25  or 30 years old today, you will need $40k (student debt) +  either between $400k and ~$800k ( for house) or $1mln ( for rent for next 50 years)+ $800k ( bills, taxes and house renovations for  next 50 years) + $40k ( phones and computers for next 50 years) + $620k ( rising 2 kids) +$100k ( college for 2 kids) + $100k  ( some savings for 2 kids) + between $100k and 300k ( yearly travels for next 50 years) + $150k ( health and otehr insurances for 50 years) + $250k ( hobbies) + $300k (cars) + $300k ( fuel and repairs for 50 years) + $100k (for some unpredicatble expenses)

Overall  between $3.3 ml and ~$5 mln  to retire and live 50 years as higher working class or lower middle class,  depending on you needs and expences. Before you will slaughter me in comments let me tell you average american earn $2.7 mln during their life time according to 2018 calculations. 

Ofc lifetime mean a lot of changes. Compare life of person that started working in 1960's that is close to retirement today. How much world, economy, prices and everything changed? A lot of shit can happen in next 10 - 20 years not even mentioning 50 years or more. Also  my math ignore both inflation or reinvesting your money. You could  retire today with $1 or $2mln and reinvest them in  smart way to have more than $5 mln in 50 years. A lot of possible changes, but this post is just to question your point of view a bit not to make 150 pages of exactly calculated data cause it would be simply impossible.


Just check your portfolio value and compare it with your goals, are they really realistic? Or maybe you underestimate amount of profit you need to get from crypto to retire or change your life. Easy to say $50k or $500k would change everything in your life. But only really brave fool would retire at 30 with just their 3 or 5  years salary with no plans for anything in long term.

personalfinance,Buying parents a house. Is this crazy?,"My parents have rented their entire lives. Financially speaking, they are comfortable but will likely need to work beyond retirement age.

I am fortunate to be in a secure, high-paying career. I want to put them in a house to eliminate their monthly rent expense, accelerate their savings, and help them get ahead.

**My plan:**

* I would get a traditional 30-year mortgage, and cover the upfront costs (20% down, closing, etc.)
* I would contribute a fixed amount to the monthly mortgage payment, so that the remainder is in-line with their current rent expenses
* Part of my annual compensation is a significant performance-based bonus. I would direct most of that into an aggressive lump-sum payment to reduce the mortgage as quickly as possible.

Saving that payment for the end of the year gives me a safety net in case we have a bad year, or run into the risks outlined below. By my quick estimates, we could have the home paid off in 3-5 years. If something goes wrong, we could just extend the payment timeline.

**I have two questions:**

* I know we're entering a period of uncertainty in the market. There are a couple benefits I could see for delaying the start of this plan - lower home prices, better interest rates. But if my goal is to pay the mortgage off as quickly as possible to eliminate that monthly expense for my parents, how much advantage is really to be gained from waiting (beyond just access to more properties in my budget)?
* I've considered various risks / opportunity costs associated with this plan.  

   * **Risk:** I or my parents lose/change jobs in the next 3-5 years.  

      * **Answer:** This is nominal, but a risk that I accept. In the worst-case scenario, we are back to our current position.
   * **Risk:** The market crashes, the value of the home could sharply decrease.  

      * **Answer:** I plan to keep the house and ultimately rent it out, so this is not as much of a concern.
   * **Risk:** The opportunity cost of putting that lump-sum payment into equities / down payments on additional investment properties.  

      * **Answer:** Helping my parents now matters more to me than the potential compound interest gains down the road.
   * Are there other major risks / opportunity costs I'm not considering?

I understand that this isn't the most profitable investment strategy. It's being driven by emotion/love - (""what's the point of having money if I can't use it do what matters most to me?""). My hope is that you can help me view this objectively.

# Methodology

We will compare three growth model:

1. \-5.70% Earnings' based growth model, with not legalization projected to 2026, perpetual growth
2. Arbitrary growth rate of 5% counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, perpetual growth
3. Arbitrary growth counting in legalization in 2023, projected until 2026, gradual growth of 5%, 7%, 10%, 15%, with averge annual perpetual growth of 12%

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

# Evaluation Methods

In this post, **three evaluation methods are used** to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of -5.70%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE from 2019 to 2022 of -5.70%.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2022 reported Free Cash Flow and its WACC based discounted rate of 9.62% and its Growth Rate of \[*scenatio 1; scenario 2; scenario 3*\]% to determine a fair value of:

1. $0.10
2. $0.37
3. $0.77

Note: the Scenario 2 and 3 is computed by using the assumption that the company will have positive free cash flow by end of 2023 as the managment planned, we assume a FCF of 10 milion

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated in the three scenarios.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.17|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of

1. $0.45
2. $4.19
3. $6.63

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.45%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|\[Scenario 1; Scenario 2; Scenario 3\]|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|611,402,300|

This model gives us a price tag of:

1. \-$3.22
2. $1.12
3. $4.97

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

||Fair Value|
|:-|:-|
|Scenario 1|\-0.89|
|Scenario 2|$1.89|
|Scenario 3|$4.12|
|**Average of the three scenarios**|**$1.70**|

* **Rented Property**: A significant proportion of the property that Tilray Inc owns is rented rather than purchased. It has to pay large amounts of rent on these adding to its costs.
* **Low current ratio**: The current ratio that shows the company’s ability to meet its short term financial obligations, is lower than the industry average. This could mean that the company could have liquidity problems in the future.
* **The company has low levels of current assets compared to current liabilities**, and this can create liquidity problems for it in operations.
* **Cash flow problems**: There is a lack of proper financial planning at Tilray Inc regarding cash flows, leading to certain circumstances where there isn’t enough cash flow as required leading to unnecessary unplanned borrowing.
* **Integration**: Tilray Inc's current structure and culture have resulted in the failure of various mergers aimed at vertical integration.
* **Market Research**: Tilray Inc has not conducted market research within the market that is serves since the past 2 years. As a result, it is making decisions based on years old data, while customer needs may have evolved over time.
* **High employee turnover rates**: Tilray Inc has a higher employee turnover rate compared to competitors. This means that it has more people leaving the job, and as a result, it is spending more on training and development as employees keep leaving and joining.
* **Quality Control**: Tilray Inc has a lower budget for its quality control department than competitors. This leads to lack of consistency and the possibility of damage to quality across its various outlets.
* **Lack of legal experience** and legal department employees are not highly qualified.
* **A few products have a high market share**, while most of the products have a low market share. This reliance on a few products makes Tilray Inc vulnerable to external threats if these few products suffer for any reason.
* **The workload is a high per worker** as there are fewer workers than the actual work required. This puts workers under psychological stress and is likely to be less productive.
* **Worker morale is low due to company culture** and politics that have grown in recent years.
* **Competition and qualified employees have been leaving** the organisation in recent years, which could mean a shortage of good talent for the company in the upcoming years.
* **The decision making is highly centralized**, and decisions by teams need to be approved by certain officials. This reduces efficiency in operations by making them more time consuming. It also leads to reduced innovation.
* **The performance appraisal is not in a systematic manner**. People are often not appraised for their performance. This leads to lower work morale and lack of promotion opportunities for employees.

## Opportunities

* **Internet**: there has been an increase in the number of internet users all over the world. This means that there is an opportunity for Tilray Inc to expand their presence online; by using the internet to interact with its customers.
* **E-commerce**: There has been a new trend and a growth in sales of the e-commerce industry. This means that a lot of people are now making purchases online. Tilray Inc can earn revenue by opening online stores and making sales through these.
* **Social Media**: there has been an increase in the number of social media users worldwide. The three social media platforms; Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, have shown the greatest number of increase in monthly active users. Tilray Inc can use social media to promote its products, interact with customers and collect feedback from them.
* **Technological developments**: technology comes with numerous benefits among many departments. Operations can be automated to reduce costs. Technology enables better data to be collected on customers and improves on marketing efforts.
* **Population**: the population has been growing and is expected to grow at a positive rate for the upcoming years. This is beneficial for Tilray Inc as there will be an increase in the number of potential customers that it can target.
* **Green government drive**: this provides an opportunity for Tilray Inc for the sale of Tilray Inc's products to federal and state government contractors.
* **Transport Industry**: the transport industry has been flourishing in the past few years, and shows growth potential in the future. This has reduced the costs of transportation, which is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will lower its overall costs.
* **Tax policy:** the governments’ reduction in tax rate is beneficial for Tilray Inc as a lower amount would be expensed out as a tax.
* **Tourism:** growth in tourism is beneficial for Tilray Inc as it will provide new potential customers that it can target in order to gain market share.
* **Skilled workers:** increase in education and training by numerous institutes has increased the amount of skilled labor available within the country. This means that if Tilray Inc is able to hire skilled labor, it would have to spend less on training and development, therefore, saving costs.
* **A number of new niche markets have opened up that are growing**. Tilray Inc can sell products in these markets and take advantage.
* **Globalisation**: Increased globalisation does not restrict Tilray Inc to its own country. It can extend its operations to other countries, entering into these markets and making use of the opportunities that lie in these markets.
* **Consumers within the industry are becoming more conscious of health, and this is a segment that is growing**. Tilray Inc can take advantage by manufacturing products that are beneficial to customer's health.
* **Trade barriers have been reduced on the import of goods**. This will reduce the costs incurred on inputs for production.
* **Regulations have loosened in recent years** making it easier for businesses to carry out their operations.

## Treats

* **Technological developments by competitors**; New technological developments by a few competitors within the industry pose a threat to Tilray Inc as customer attracted to this new technology can be lost to competitors, decreasing Tilray Inc’s overall market share.
* **Suppliers:** The bargaining power of suppliers has increased over the years with the decrease in the number of suppliers. This means that the costs of inputs could increase for Tilray Inc.
* **New entrants:** there have been numerous players that have entered the market and are gaining market share by gaining existing companies’ market share. This is a threat to Tilray Inc as it can lose its customers to these new entrants.
* **Increasing competition**: there has been an increase in competition within the industry putting downward pressure on prices. This could lead to reduced revenue for Tilray Inc if it adjusts to the price changes, or loss of market share if it doesn’t.
* **Exchange Rate:** the exchange rate keeps fluctuating and this affects a company like Tilray Inc that has sales internationally, while its suppliers are local.
* **Political uncertainties** in the country prove to be a barrier in business, hindering performance at times and making the business incur unnecessary costs.
* **The fluctuating interest rates** in the country do not provide a stable financial and economic environment.
* **Consumer tastes are changing**, and this puts pressure on companies to constantly change their products to meet the needs of these customers.
* **Substitute products available are also increasing**, which is threat collectively for the whole industry as consumption of current products decrease.
* **The rise in prices of fuel** has increased in the input costs for Tilray Inc. These costs have also increased as other industries that provide inputs for this company also have suffered from increasing fuel prices, thereby charging more.
* **Increased promotions by competitors** have been a threat for Tilray Inc. On most media, there is more clutter than ever, and customers are bombarded with multiple messages. This reduces the effectiveness of promotional messages by Tilray Inc.
* **Constant technological developments require the workforce to be trained** accordingly as the inability to keep up with these changes can lead to loss of business for Tilray Inc.

# Final Considerations

**What is its future potential?**

Without Legalization, the company is destined to fail. It is burning its cash at a 2.09 rate, leaving it only 25 months of life expectancy (take in mind that this is an assumption cause obviously in those 25 months the company will have sales and other operations bringing in cash, the life expectancy is calculated on the assumption the company will not have further sales or other income of cash, so take this data as indicative).  If we assume a recover of macro data, consumption shall growth in other segments in which the company operates, cause marijuana is not its biggest nor main revenue stream. The company is well diversified of even without legalisation we shall expect to see it aroun in the next 5 years.

With Legalizaion, it is moon time baby. Its fundamentals, at the most conservative assumptions, prices it around 4$ but we all know that hype will push it further that price level bring it to be overvalued. Retailers and institution will surely try to cash in the hype so beware of speculative plays.

With the legalization scenarios, we can expect two outcomes:

1. The Management do not manage to contain costs and improve efficiency, making it growth slow
2. The Management manages to cut cost and boost efficiency, making Tilray grow

There is potential, but risk is very high

**What are the risks?**

Observing statistical data about Tilray's price movements, we can except a 7.72% risk rate. The Stock's return distribution is concentrated around negative numbers. If you want to invest for long time expect a miminum retuern rate of 0.12% and a 44% chancge of getting a daily price movement between -4% and 0%

**Is the company a Buy or a Sell?**

This is hard. It all depend on legalization in the USA, and if it happens, it depends on when it happens. If legalization comes in 5 years, welp, this company is going tits up, but if it come next week, well, you know the drill.

Personally this stock is a Gamble, cause its fate is determined heavily by politics.

Are you a Gamblerer?

personalfinance,How to invest for house in 5-10 years?,"Hi. My general goal is to save up money for a house (as close to a cash purchase as possible) in 5-10 years. (meaning I want a house but can not afford it at all. I also think that it would be a better ROI to pay for it in cash than to have a mortgage factoring in financial stability in case I lose my job. I'm still a young professional, so I don't fully know what my salary will be or what job I'll want to be working.) I want to buy a house in cash because my partner earns 35k per year, and if I lose my job, I want to be able to afford home payments in our area for the type of house we want on just his salary. Interest rates on any decent-sized mortgage are so insane in terms of what they can do to monthly payments that I'd rather just save up in cash and wait to buy.  


My goal would be to continue saving money throughout the 5-10 years. I am hoping to start at 20-30k per year.  


""For any time frame under 3 to 5 years, you should just use savings or money market accounts. If the idea of low interest rates is too much to bear, you can also consider using I Bonds or a CD ladder.""

I'm new to investing, but would opening a government-sponsored retirement account (separate from my 401k) be a terrible idea to use for saving cash? Or should I use ""I Bonds or CD ladder""? I was thinking that if there is leftover money after withdrawing for a house purchase, it could be used to continue that retirement account. There could potentially be investment options that are worth the penalty compared to other options. I'm not sure though since I am new.Which one of these is the best option and why?",finance,1667770637
CryptoCurrency,U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) may police social media content that undermines trust in financial systems,"*tl;dr DHS considered countering disinformation relating to content that undermines trust in financial systems.*

It's no secret that many people in the cryptocurrency community are highly critical of government financial systems, everything from how they are created and managed to regulation and enforcement.

I found an interesting article by [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/) about the DHS and their aspiration to monitor and counter disinformation online. One of the parts that caught my eye was the mention of countering disinformation around financial systems.

&gt;In June, the same DHS advisory committee of CISA — which includes Twitter head of legal policy, trust, and safety Vijaya Gadde and University of Washington professor Kate Starbird — drafted a [report](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23131362-june-22-2022-draft-cisa-report) to the CISA director calling for an expansive role for the agency in shaping the “information ecosystem.” The report called on the agency to closely monitor “social media platforms of all sizes, mainstream media, cable news, hyper partisan media, talk radio and other online resources.” **They argued that the agency needed to take steps to halt the “spread of false and misleading information,**” with a focus on information that undermines “key democratic institutions, such as the courts, or by other sectors such as the **financial system**, or public health measures.” 

Source: [https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/](https://theintercept.com/2022/10/31/social-media-disinformation-dhs/)

Taking Argentina, for example, had [three different](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/why-70percent-inflation-is-just-one-of-argentinas-problems/2022/09/02/9d6e8dd6-2ad5-11ed-a90a-fce4015dfc8f_story.html) economy ministers between July and September. Moreover, people distrust the financial system after years of inflation, which has significantly worsened this year and is turning Argentinians to crypto. People in many countries are sometimes led to distrust the government's ability to manage the economy and financial systems, to the point that they turn to cryptocurrency.

How do you feel about DHS countering what it deems ""false and misleading information""? How might this impact content that critiques institutions such as the Federal Reserve and their handling of inflation and interest rates? Or what about critiques of government regulation around crypto? What about voicing support for the use of crypto as an alternative to FIAT? Who decides what misleading or false information is?

I'm not trying to raise some big alarm bell, but I wonder how this move by the DHS might impact cryptocurrency users on social media. What if talking about crypto get's your posts labelled/flagged in the same manner as, for example, anti-vaxxers?",cryptocurrency,1667770909

We have lived in our house for a decent amount of time and have seen quite a rise in value over that time. We are trying to break up amicably right now so we are trying to figure out what to do with the house. We have looked at three options. 

1) sell the house and split the money (we are in a no cause/equitable state). Market is a bit flat and mortgage rates are rising so we are not getting a he value we would have gotten this past summer. 

2) one person tries to buy out the other person and keep the house. This is for the sake of our three girls who have lived here from day one. I don’t think either of us could swing this due to our current individual yearly salary and mortgage rates steadily climbing. One of us would have to drain our savings to do this to even make it remotely possible. Possibly take from our 401k. 

3) we each pay off the rest of our mortgage equally and one person lives in there. That person would only have property taxes and other ancillary costs at that point. The person that does would then pay the others person’s apartment fee until the kids are both in college and then we sell the place at that time and spit the value. This would be happen in the next seven years. The house would increase in value over that time, hopefully interest rates come down, and the kids would not be disrupted as much. 

The third option sounds a little pie-in-the-sky but we have talked about it a little. It seems like there are a lot of what-ifs in the third scenario. Is there a clear and better choice here? If we sell now with a bit of a flat market we would not get as much as we possibly could.

For my new car, I want a subcompact sedan. I like very small cars with good gas mileage. My old car was a 2010 Toyota Yaris, and I loved the thing. Whatever it is, it has to be reliable. I live in the middle of nowhere (30mi from work) and there is no public transportation here. I want to move closer, but I don't have the money to move yet. 

My details: 
I'm in Ohio, female, and over 25, if it matters. 

Credit Karma says my score is 750. 

In the bank: $4,000

Monthly disposable income (after tax, all insurance, utilities, groceries, etc. This is going to go down a little due to a new phone and car insurance plan, and of course, the new car payment.): ~$800 

Totalled Car Payout: $7,600 

I will probably get a little more in insurance money, but not much. I don't know amounts yet. 

Credit Card Debt: $4,500 (I usually buy everything on CC, then pay it off monthly. No interest. 2021 messed me up, and I was digging myself out of debt. Would have paid it off %100 before the December payment was due and started building my emergency/moving funds again, but the accident ruined that.)

Dad's Opinion:
Buy a new car such as a Kia Rio S or Toyota Corolla. It'll have a warranty, it will be reliable for many years to come, and have good resale value. Prices around me seem to be around $22-23 thousand. $20 if I'm very lucky, but I don't have the time to wait for 20. Use the full $7,600 as a down payment. 

My Opinion: 
Buy a used certified car, which has a 7 year, 100,000mi warranty. Stay under 50,000 miles, one owner, and no accidents on record. That would be around $16-18 thousand. Combine my savings and the car payout ($11,600) to pay off the CC debt entirely, save $1,000 for emergencies, then dump the remaining $6,100 into a down payment for the used car.

Edit 2. Thank you for all the responses! New won by a landslide and the reasoning is sound, so that's what I'll do. I'm still miffed I'm going to have a car payment again when I was so close to being debt free, but such is life. Thanks again for all the advice!",finance,1667782068

personalfinance,New grad looking for mortgage,"Hi all,

Just finished my engineering degree and now got a job, a car and a student loan to pay. Still at my parent's but looking to buy my place, I prefer the idea of paying a mortgage then a rent for obvious reason.

Curent situation :

* 19k student loan @ 6% interest rate (freezed at 0% until march 2023 due to Covid, thanks Trudeau)
* 15k car loan @ 6% interest rate
* 12k in savings (SPY wich is going -6% per week now l.o.l.)
* Salary is 3.5k net /month, wich 2k can go to saving/paying off debts

From what i've discussed with real estate broker, the student loan does not come in the equation for mortgage amount and only personal loan, such as car loan. Therefore if the goal is to buy a place the main concern is to pay off car loan, get a higher cashdown and salary.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 1 : Put all savings in paying off car loan. Do minimal payment on student loan for 15y (wich result in paying 10k interest in that time period) and build back a cashdown at a 2k/month pace.

&amp;#x200B;

Scenario 2 : Put 2k/month in student loan until march 2023 (before interest start)(result in paying 3k in interest overall). Then pay the car loan 2k/ month for 8 months. This scenario pay the least amount of interest and I dont use my saving. Could also put savings in car loan.

&amp;#x200B;

Question is :

Should I prioritize paying off student loan debt quicker, since it reduce my total amount of interest paid OR focus on building a cashdown and reducing my car loan so my profile is better mortgage wise?

Bitcoin,"For privacy-focused Bitcoin users, what are your thoughts on Chainalysis and Elliptic?","Most exchanges and payment processors in the United States are reluctant to accept Bitcoin that have been applied to CoinJoin since it is too expensive to trace the incoming Bitcoin back to a wallet that was issued by a KYC exchange (or KYC wallet/exchange system).

investing,Question about Treasury Bills and the auction market.,"Hey I am considering building a T-Bill ladder with relatively long projected maturities (thinking about 17 week and 26 week maturity levels).

I know there is an option to sell your T-Bills prematurely, but you are at the whim of the secondary market to put a price. This leads to caution being thrown that your T-Bills could be worth less if interest rates go up.

I feel like this correlation is a bit too simplistic. Shouldn't the value of a T-Bill be also proportional to how much it has matured? A T-Bill close to maturity is worth the $100/$1000 value so even if rates go up after purchasing, I find it incredibly hard that it loses more value to sell at a loss.

It feels like the loss function would be: \[TIME REMAINING\] x \[most analogous T-Bill maturity rates\]. So for example if I had 4 weeks left to mature on a T-Bill, I would be selling it at \[1 month\] x \[current rates for 4-week-T-Bills\].

Can someone explain what situations are realistic for auctioning T-Bills at a loss?",finance,1667788012

As of now I'm split 50/50 between the S&amp;P and a dividend cover call ETF. However, I'm hesitating because the economic conditions outside the US are deteriorating. Here're my current concerns:

* The continued rise of interest rates and the continued strengthing of the dollar will continue to hamper the economic growth of countries, especially developing countries. Sri Lanka is said to be the first domino of many.
* Food scarcity is getting worse globally. China, Ukraine and others have banned fertilizer exports. India, China, Egypt and a mayrid of other countries have banned exports of wheat, cereal, and/or other commodities. Mulitple countries have had sub par harvests as well. Argentina, India, etc. While we don't have data, I'm sure China has suffered as well due to their ongoing drought.
* China is continuing to have economic headwinds, which is especially concerning considering that they're the biggest player on the block from an international standpoint. Xi, in his infinite wisdom, is bringing back a planned economy, essentially returning the country to the days of Mao. I probably don't need to tell you how this is affecting the mindset of the country's rich and entrepreneurial. I personally don't see China surviving as it exists today by the end of the decade.

* Employees are on edge after the bank began cutting workers in April and internal projections point to more departures.

Mortgage volumes at Wells Fargo slowed further in recent weeks, leaving some workers idle and sparking concerns the lender will need to cut more employees as the U.S. housing slump deepens.

The bank had about 18,000 loans in its retail origination pipeline in the early weeks of the fourth quarter, according to people with knowledge of the company’s figures. That is down as much as 90% from a year earlier, when the Covid pandemic\-fueled housing boom was in full swing, said the people, who declined to be identified speaking about internal matters.

The U.S. housing market has been on a roller coaster in recent years, taking off in 2020 thanks to easy-money policies and the adoption of remote work, and slowing down this year as the Federal Reserve boosted rates. Homebuyers have been squeezed and the pace of refinancing has plummeted as borrowing costs surged to more than 7% for a 30-year loan from about 3% a year earlier. And rates may climb further as the Fed is expected to boost its benchmark rate again Wednesday.

The situation has pressured the home loan industry, particularly firms like Rocket Mortgage that thrived on loan refinancings, and is expected to lead to consolidation among newer nonbank players that rushed to serve customers after most U.S. banks receded from the market.

Among the six biggest U.S. banks, Wells Fargo has historically been the most reliant on mortgages. But that has begun to change under CEO Charlie Scharf, who has said that the bank is looking to shrink the business and focus primarily on serving existing customers.

# Early warning

In October, the bank warned investors that the housing market could slow further after saying that mortgage originations fell nearly 60% in the third quarter.

“We expect it to remain challenging in the near term,” CFO Mike Santomassimo told analysts Oct. 14. “It’s possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the Q4 when originations are seasonally slower.”

Employees are on edge after the bank began cutting workers in April and internal projections point to more departures. Local news outlets have reported when Wells Fargo offices have been required to disclose impending job cuts in a municipality.

The ranks of mortgage loan officers, who mainly earn commissions from closing deals, is expected to drop to under 2,000 from more than 4,000 at the start of the year, according to one of the people. Many salespeople haven’t closed a single loan in recent weeks, this person said.

Another person said that most of the exits have been voluntary as bankers sought other opportunities, making departures and staffing levels hard to predict.

“The changes we’ve recently made are the result of the broader rate environment and consistent with the response of other lenders in the industry,” a Wells Fargo spokesman said in a statement. “We regularly review and adjust staffing levels to align with market conditions and the needs of our businesses.”

The bank said last month that its total workforce shrank by about 14,000 people in the third quarter, a 6% decline to 239,209 employees.

Wells Fargo shares are down about 2% since the start of the year.

4. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue.  In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

Banking,Does Average Daily Balance apply if I don't owe any money on my credit card?,"I'm still trying to wrap my head around average daily balance. Most examples online mentioned a previous balance. If I don't have a balance, I'm assuming average daily balance is irrelevant to me, right?

Below is taken from [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/averagedailybalance.asp).

&gt;**Average Daily Balance Method Example**  
&gt;  
&gt;A credit card has a monthly interest rate of 1.5 percent, and the **previous balance is $500.** On the 15th day of a billing cycle, the credit card company receives and credits a customer’s payment of $300. On the 18th day, the customer makes a $100 purchase.  
&gt;  
&gt;The average daily balance is ((14 x 500) + (3 x 200) + (13 x 300)) / 30 = (7,000 + 600 + 3,900) / 30 = 383.33. The bigger the payment a customer pays and the earlier in the billing cycle the customer makes a payment, the lower the finance charges assessed. The denominator, 30 in this example, will vary based on the number of days in the billing cycle for a given month.",finance,1667818650

MachineLearning,"[D] Do you think there is a competitive future for smaller, locally trained/served models?","Increasingly large/deep models for Sound/Image/Language/Games are all the rage (you know what I'm talking about). This is concerning on some level:

1. Focus shifts to amount of data, instead of curation
2. Require more (expensive) hardware to train, out of reach for many
3. API-ization of functionality leads to large scale monitoring by centralized providers

Lets take OpenAI Codex / Github Copilot as an example: Disregarding the licensing questions for a bit, amazing as this model is, there are some drawbacks observed when using it:

* It can generate outdated code or API calls, especially for evolving languages
* Known vulnerabilities observed in generated code [e.g. MITRE weaknesses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub_Copilot#Security_concerns)
* No local use of the service, unless replicated and self hosted (expensive)

Now my questions are these:   

Do you think there is a case to be made for smaller models fed with higher quality data?  Can we substantially reduce number of parameters if we do better with the input?     
For example a Codex-like model for a single language only.

Or do you think that the pre-training of large models and then refining to task (e.g. GPT or maybe programmer -&gt; specific language) will continue to dominate because we require the amount of parameters for the tasks at hand anyway?

stocks,The US Northeast Is Hurtling Toward a Winter Heating Crisis,"(Bloomberg) -- In the most densely populated corner of the US, temperatures are about to drop after a stretch of unusually warm weather. And the signs of a winter crisis are already multiplying.

Heating oil delivered to New York is the priciest ever. Retailers in Connecticut are rationing it to prevent panic buying. New England’s stockpiles of diesel and heating oil — the same product, taxed differently — are a third of normal levels. Natural gas inventories are also below average. A Massachusetts-based utility is imploring President Joe Biden to prepare emergency measures to prevent a gas shortage.

Add some cold to the mix, and in the best-case scenario, Northeast consumers will shoulder the highest energy bills in decades this winter. The Biden administration, under pressure to tame prices ahead of the midterm elections, is considering ways to stash more diesel and gasoline in New England. In the worst-case scenario, a cluster of states with a combined economy bigger than Japan’s will run out of fuel to keep the lights on and heat homes and businesses. 

“It’s going to be pretty bad,” said Marcus McGregor, head of commodities research at Conning Inc. “Diesel, heating oil and natural gas prices are through the roof. When you’re on a fixed salary, how does it impact your overall budget? It has to be bad.”

The Northeast is no stranger to fuel constraints. Its dearth of pipelines and refineries means the shale fields of Texas and Pennsylvania might as well be on the other side of the world. But now, a global supply crunch intensified by the war in Ukraine is putting the region at risk of an energy disaster to rival the one menacing Europe. The Northeast will compete with countries across the Atlantic and around the world for fuel to generate power, fill up trucks and keep the cold at bay.

Rocky MacDonald, a father of three and realtor in Stoneham, Massachusetts, expects to pay over $500 for heating oil to keep his three-bedroom ranch house warm this winter.  That’s about 20% more than last year. To save money, MacDonald and his wife are cooking dinner at home more often. When they do go out, they skip the bottle of wine.

“I just can’t believe it. The monthly expenses are crazy amounts,” said MacDonald. “I’m trying to hoard every penny.” His family’s total spending has climbed to $10,000 a month from $8,000 last year, and he’s worried that rising interest rates will trigger a housing-market slump, eating away at his income. 

For Rocky and other consumers grappling with historic inflation, the outlook is increasingly dire. Americans are poised to spend the most on heating in at least 25 years this winter, government estimates show.

In the Northeast, a typical family is expected to pay $1,094 to keep warm with natural gas this winter, 23% more than last year, the Energy Information Administration said. Homes that rely on oil for heat — primarily in New England and the Mid-Atlantic — will be hit even harder, with an average bill of $2,354. Northeast households using propane will spend about $1,970. Low-income consumers will suffer the most.

 “Some of the most at-risk people of suffering when heating fuel runs out are immigrants and refugees,” said Jeffrey Thielman, president of the nonprofit International Institute of New England. “We are very concerned about the coming winter.”

That creates a tricky political calculus for the Biden administration. US energy exports have surged amid pressure to help European allies replace sanction-hit Russian supplies. But Biden is also facing calls to curb such shipments to help consumers at home. For Republicans, inflation has proved to be a potent political weapon: A press release announcing a Donald Trump rally in Pennsylvania this month noted the state’s surging heating oil prices. 

So far, the Biden administration is using one of the few tools it has at its disposal to tackle high pump prices: It’s releasing unprecedented amounts of crude oil from the nation’s emergency reserves. But that can only go so far. US refineries are already running flat out, and without excess capacity to process the crude into usable fuel, the extra oil releases don't do much good.

Of course, much depends on Mother Nature. Meteorologists are predicting relatively mild temperatures for Europe and the Northeast this winter thanks to the weather pattern known as La Nina. Gas prices for next-month delivery have tumbled on both sides of the Atlantic as a warm autumn curtails demand. But in late October, the UK’s national weather service said the country’s chances of a colder-than-normal winter are increasing.

At the heart of the Northeast’s energy squeeze is natural gas. Even after Pennsylvania’s shale boom brought abundant supplies to the region’s doorstep, constraints have persisted. 

That’s because New England and the Mid-Atlantic are more reliant on gas than ever. Coal-fired power plants have shut in droves, falling victim to environmental opposition and competition from cheap gas. Wind turbines and solar farms haven’t sprouted up quickly enough to replace them. And that bounty of shale gas in Pennsylvania? Concerns about climate change have scuttled plans for pipelines to bring it eastward. The Northeast’s dilemma reveals how the energy transition, at least in the short term, is ratcheting up the pain for consumers. 

Almost half the electricity generated in New England and New York comes from gas. In extreme cold, heating may take priority over running power plants, which keep the lights on.

“The New England region has been on a lousy carousel ride for about a decade now trying to address the risk that comes each winter because of its over-reliance on a single fuel source,” Allison Clements, commissioner for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said in an interview.

Heating oil and diesel are also part of the equation. The number of Northeast households that use heating oil has ticked lower as more switch to gas, but that’s little comfort to the almost 20% of homes there that still rely on it. The East Coast, the one US region dependent on foreign imports, has to vie with countries struggling to replace Russian supply.  Refineries from Virginia to New Jersey have shut after failing to compete with larger Gulf Coast rivals.

A diesel shortage, meanwhile, can have devastating economic consequences.  The bulk of consumer goods moves on trucks and trains powered by the fuel, which is also used in manufacturing and food production.

The Northeast isn’t entirely isolated from oil and gas pumped from other US regions. It can pull supplies from pipelines snaking up from the Gulf Coast and other points west. Heating oil and diesel are also delivered by truck and train. In rare cases, they come by sea, though the law requires that only US-built ships deliver fuel within the country — and there aren’t many of those. 

But in a deep freeze, the Northeast will need more supply from abroad. The bulk of it will come from Canada, and some will come from Europe, a region that will be hard-pressed to export fuel with its own energy security at stake as the continent pivots away from Russia.

Other supplies will arrive from overseas. Cargoes of liquefied natural gas set sail each winter from Trinidad under a long-term contract and arrive at a terminal outside of Boston. Shipments to the East Coast have also come from Nigeria and a handful of other countries. 

On peak days in the winter, as much as 35% of New England’s natural gas supply comes from LNG cargoes, according to New Hampshire utility Unitil Corp. And the US will find itself in competition with buyers from the UK to Japan.

That’s also true for so-called distillates like heating oil and diesel. Last year, more than a fifth of the East Coast’s supply came from abroad.

Eventually, the Northeast may be able to wean itself off foreign fuel by ramping up renewable energy. But in the short term, there’s little relief in sight. 

“It’s not gonna be pretty for the consumer,” said Robert Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA.

investing,Annuity vs long term treasuries,"Hello,

I don't know anything about annuities but I was wondering what the advantages/disadvantages they have over long term treasuries.

I think what I'm considering is a ""fixed"" annuity??  I don't know the terms, but I am interested in paying a large lump sum now to be paid later over the course of 20-30 years.  I don't want life insurance but rather just an investment product.  

I'm in my 40s and in general I am pretty conservative.  I've always said if I could get a 5% gaurenteed return via fixed income, I would do it.  In recent years, that was very difficult but with the increases in interest rates, this has become more possible. 

With 30yr treasuries over 4% now, I am considering buying 30 yr bonds monthly.  Maybe $1000 per month indefinitely??  

Are there fixed annuity products out there that are better?  It's hard for me to find a clear rate on an annuity without talking to a salesman. 

Sorry if this is wordy but thanks in advance for your help!",finance,1667836762

In Canada the federal government is pausing all Twitter ads in the wake of mass layoffs at the company.  

Cossette, which is the government's ""media agency of record,"" issued guidance Friday to ""pause activity immediately and monitor the situation over the weekend"" due to ""unknown continuity plans for moderation"" and a ""heightened risk of brand safety,"" according to an internal document seen by CBC News. 

Twitter has laid off 50% of it's staff following Musk's takeover.  15% of the team responsible for moderation and safety was affected although Twitter is adament that their core moderation capabilities remain in place.

This raises a giant red flag for a lot of users who view twitters success as being linked ot the future of Dogecoin, a crypto payment method that Elon Musk is supporting.  Numberous companies such as General Mills, General Motors, Pfizer adn Volkswagon have all put their advertising on hold in the wake of these recent developments.

personalfinance,Combining homes - What seems best? Any tips or things to look for?,"Here's a run down. My partner and I (both around 40) are hoping to live together soon, but doing so is going to mean making a few decisions regarding properties we currently own, as well as obviously some financial and legal agreements regarding anything we purchase together (unmarried). Unfortunately we are also looking at this at a time where interest rates are high and home prices have not yet fallen. We're workshopping scenarios currently that allow us to live together within the next 6 months, in a way that is the most financially advantageous.

Currently, I own a small (1,100 SF), 2 bedroom rowhome in a major city. I brought about 14 years ago, when home prices had fallen quite a bit (but interest rates were pretty high), in an area of the city that was generally lower income. My (at the time freshly renovated) home cost me about $100k. I put down 20%. I refinanced down to a 15 year loan at a much lower rate around 2020. The home needs some repairs, if I am to rent it, which would likely run about $10,000 - $12,000. Market rent for the home once that is done is around $1,400 per month. My payments prior to utilities (taxes, mortgage, insurance) are a little under $800 per month. I have an estimated 70% equity in my home, which is now worth about $175k in its current condition, as my neighborhood is gentrifying rapidly. It would sell for $280k+ with about $40k worth of repairs/renovations/updates. 

I have 2 pet cats (this is relevant to our scenario), under 10k in debt outside of my mortgage (some recent medical bills and other emergency expenses I'm paying off), about $30k I could easily access towards a down payment, and my credit score is in the mid 700s. My income is somewhat variable, but should be between $90K and $110K annually. 

 My partner owns a larger than me, but still not large (1,400 SF), row home that he purchased about 3 years ago in a more established area of the same city. His home cost was about $300k, and he put 20% down. His interest rate on his loan is low, and I think his total expenses (mortgage, taxes, insurance) are about $1,400 monthly. Readying his home for rent would require a fresh coat of paint and not much else. Market rent for his house would be about $2,000 per month. Considering the current real estate situation, the relatively stable home value in his area, and the short length of time he has owned his home, selling it now would likely be a loss. 

My partner has 1 cat and one dog, who for now are kept separate (One has the upstairs and one has the downstairs), little to no debt outside his mortgage, great credit, and an income at least double mine. He has more in savings than I do, however, most of it is invested. Now is not a great time to pull any of that money, especially for a down payment in inflated market, and we'd prefer not to immediately.

Neither of our current homes is large enough for both of us and our pets to live in. Selling his house now would come at a loss. Selling mine is letting go of a property that has great long term investment potential. Our thought is that even when we cohabitate, we'd like to hold onto one of these properties as a rental/investment (especially if our new home is outside the city). 

One stop-gap option we are considering is that we put the work in that it would take to rent my home ($10-12k), and then ""rent it"" short term, fully furnished for a small maintenance and utility fee, to a live in pet-sitter (so essentially, their rent would be covered, as payment for daily care of my cats, they'd just be paying a $300-$400 a month utility/maintenance fee, and I'd be able to stop in to see and check on my cats within guidelines/keep a bed and and a few items in the smaller bedroom, so I could stay there if the tenant/house-sitter is away). I'd move into my partner's house temporarily, and hopefully, within 6 months interest rates go down a bit or home prices fall a bit, as they're too high for where current rates are, and we can buy a home that is more suitable long-term, without feeling like we're doing something financially stupid. I'm not even sure that scenario is possible. 

The other alternative (outside of continuing to live separately for longer than either of us ideally wants to) is that we rent both our properties for a year, rent a home together that is big enough for both of us, and look at buying after that time. Regardless, the question becomes which of our houses do we keep after we purchase one together?

Unless something changes, selling mine to a developer/rehabber would fund most of our down payment on a new home. Selling his would be a break even at best (more likely a loss), and getting it ready to rent would require very little. That said, in this scenario, we've already maybe put the money and work into getting my house in rental shape, the rental income on my house would be about equivalent to the rental income on his house, the home values and rental rates in my area are increasing more rapidly than in his area, and with some careful planning, barring unforeseen disasters, I could own this property outright in less than 5 years.  Long term that has potential for decent investment income, and a good lump sum from a sale to invest/retire earlier. 

Monthly expense split on any combined home purchase will be based on income percentage, contribution towards down payment, etc; as would equity share. This will be spelled out via a legal document, that may down the line be rolled into a prenup. If my partner contributes money towards getting my house into rental property shape, that contribution will be returned back to him as equity in that property. If I move into his space temporarily, with a house-sitter living in mine, I will continue paying the expenses for my house, and he will continue paying for his. Groceries and household supplies will be split up.

So, which property seems best to keep and how?",finance,1667839565
investing,Does fidelity calculate your rate of return accurately?,"So I started my full time job out of college this year and interned with the same company starting in January. 

It says my rate of return is -21% which is not good lol but not much different than the market right now.

My thought process is that this is just a flaw in how they show the rate of return. My rate of return should really be the precent difference between my cost basis and the current price of the fund. 


The fund is fed freedom 2065k. The current price is 9.98 and my cost basis is 10.12. So that means I’m real only down (1-9.98/10.12) which is about 1.3%.

If the taxes due are not paid by the estate, what happens to the executor of the estate, or anyone funds are distributed to? It seems to me the family would be open to a range of IRS related problems, but the tax attorney was adamant that there will be no future liability for anyone other than FIL.

personalfinance,Would appreciate help validating/critiquing the options I'm considering for buying a new home in a hot Texas market with today's higher interest rates...,"Hi! I'm a regular contributor here but don't want to expose all my finances tied to my regular account so here I am on this random username Reddit made me.

My family bought a house about 5 years ago and have refinanced a couple times; it's now worth about $835K and we owe $390K on a 30-year at 2.875%. Pretty great situation and hard to walk away from. But... we *really* would like more space for reasons related to our family growing and my spouse and I now both working from home.

We'd like to move into something around in the $1-$1.2 million range. We gross about $300K/year with no car payments or other debts. Our only atypical expense is $30K/year for private school tuition, but we probably make up for a huge chunk of that with our general frugality. We have healthy savings, 401Ks/IRAs, HSA investment accounts, etc., and in theory I'm not opposed to decreasing 401K contributions somewhat since we do have some other real estate and business investments. But, I'm trying for the most part to just focus on the scenario at hand.

Right now, our PITI is about $3,000/month in our $835K house. Moving into $1 million would bring us into up to like $7,000 I think. Pretty crazy. Property taxes are about 2.1% and I'm budgeting $5,000 for insurance.

So in theory, the $445K from our current house is available if we want to use it to buy something new and just decrease our principal. Or we could look at buying down the rate on a new house. But, I also hate the idea of walking away from having $390K at 2.875%.

One possibility I'm considering is renting out the current house at maybe $5K/month (I've been a landlord before and happy to do it again) and seeing if I can use a 2nd mortgage to get at some of that remaining equity that's locked up in there in a way that will keep the old house breaking even and building equity while allowing me to still contribute more to the new house's payment; in theory I think I can get $348K out of the current house at an 80% LTV of the current equity.

But...not sure what I'm not considering here. Ultimately I've just been playing the waiting game and building up reserves while enjoying a $1,675 P&amp;I on an $835K house, and obviously the longer I can do that the better.

personalfinance,Check my logic on UTMA/UGMA account vs. just putting money in my name,"Background:  
We have a 2 year old who has a savings account with our bank (for the random money he gets from Grandma) but I was considering opening a full blown investment account for him. My husband disagreed with me (his logic, we should save the money ourselves and determine how we want to dole it out in the future).  


After some research, I'm in agreement with him. This is the email I sent him and I'm curious if you think I'm missing something:  


&gt;If we open a UTMA/UGMA (Uniform Transfer to Minors Act and Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account the money would be $REDACTED'S as soon as he comes of age (either 18 or 21). Downside is if he’s an absolute ding-a-ling and we just gifted the kid $30K that he can do whatever with. Another downside is this would be counted against him since it’s an asset if he applied for financial aid.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;The current federal gift tax limit is $17K in one calendar year, so if you wanted to avoid taxes you’d need to give below that in a year. That obviously might change in 30 years, but that’s what it is today.  There are also ways to avoid this if you get fancy with taxes.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;So with that said, no Roth IRA right now. We should def get our kids to open one when they are earning money. UTMA account doesn’t really make sense either because why does $REDACTED need money in his name, we can just save our own money (like you suggested) and gift to our kids as we see fit.  
  
&gt;  
&gt;TL/DR: No action required! If a family member randomly gives $REDACTED $500+ I think I would put it in a  UTMA account so that it can grow vs. his savings account but I am not going to proactively open the account. It doesn’t make sense for us right now.

personalfinance,Is now still a good idea/time for home renovation? Looking for reassurance on what I'm doing.,"Disclaimer: this question is more about making sure I'm thinking clearly and managing anxiety more than it is about the specific financials.      

I own a home in a wealthy area that is a bit of a tourist destination. (I am not super wealthy)       
      
We are doing a home renovation that will add some square footage to the home and building an ADU (Accessory Dwelling Unit).     
     
We bought the home for $1M a year ago.  The cost for the renovation and building an ADU is ~$650k + ~$20k in loan fees. I am borrowing $400k and paying the rest in cash. The post-construction appraisal (i.e. what an appraiser expects the value of the home to be with more square footage and a rentable ADU once construction is complete) is $1.9M.     
      
The simplified version is that I'm paying $675k to make $900k - that seems like fairly straightforward math. I know it's unusual for value to go up that much, but as mentioned I live in a touristy destination that is extremely wealthy, and just happened to get an inexpensive small house on a large lot (for reference, the AVERAGE home price in this location is $6M).     
     
My question is mainly around timing and interest rates.      
      
I'm borrowing $400k at 7.5% interest on a construction loan. This rate is adjustable DURING construction (which is expected to take 6 months, though I'm assuming 9) and once construction is complete it will stay at a flat rate of 7.5%. During construction only interest payments are required, and after construction the monthly payment is about $3000. It is a 15 year fixed loan amortized over 30 years with a balloon payment at 15 - I plan to pay more than the monthly payment in order to avoid a massive balloon payment after 15 years...or more than likely I will refinance whenever interest rates drop down again.      
      
Additionally, I have a cousin who said he could rent the ADU for $2500/month if we let him live there, though the average rental price in our area for a unit the size of our ADU is $3500-$5000/month. During tourist season people do vacation rentals on similarly sized units for $3000-$5000 per week. We'll likely rent it to someone other than a cousin, but wanted to mention that to show that we'll have AT LEAST $2500 covered each month.
      
Everyday, I see in the news more information about housing costs, interest rates, etc., and am not totally sure what to expect as I tend to get a lot of anxiety and honestly cant think clearly when it comes to investing my own money.  However, at the end of the day I keep coming back to the idea of paying $675k to make $900k.

This week has seen articles on mastodon in general and on how to get set up in [wired](https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-twitter-friends-on-mastodon/), [wired2](https://www.wired.com/story/join-mastodon-twitter-alternative/), [the guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/media/2022/nov/01/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk-takeover), [time](https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/), [nytimes](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/07/technology/mastodon-twitter-elon-musk.html), [bbc](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-63534240), [thejournal](https://www.thejournal.ie/what-is-mastodon-and-how-do-i-join-it-ireland-5912976-Nov2022/), [sz](https://www.sueddeutsche.de/wirtschaft/mastodon-twitter-netzwerk-dezentral-1.5574623), and so many more.. 

The trigger for this has been the turmoil at Twitter. But whatever the cause, and whatever you think about Elon Musk making Twitter his personal property, I would have expected this community to be excited about a mass movement to Mastodon, and actively encouraging it / joining in. Surely this community understands that a decentralised social network in which moderation is local/opt-in, in which you can move your account to another node at any time and keep your followers, in which you can run your own node, that this is an extremely valuable thing in itself, and that it opens the space up to so much more development, improvement, and experimentation.

Instead, I find that among my followings, everyone except the crypto crowd is trying to decentralise while this community just shrugs.

It might not be a web3 utopia, but its a lot better than one privately owned network. Here is a chance to move things in the right direction... and yet ..

Why? 
Shouldn't we give it a go? Try it out? 
It's open source. Adding ENS authentication is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). Adding IPFS/Swarm support is [one PR away](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon). We can even [host our own instances](https://docs.joinmastodon.org/user/run-your-own/) to experiment while still being connected to the wider network.

I'd love to see you all over there!

personalfinance,How would a monthly car stipend change outlook on vehicle purchase?,"This became long, thanks for reading. 

Question is above but let me layout some background. 

**Background**: My wife (30) and I (30) purchased a home last year ($230,000) LCOL area 2.8% interest rate, have two cars completely paid off, and no debt outside of our mortgage. Unfortunately, one car (188,000 miles 2013 Subaru forester) is beginning to show signs of age and I want to become prepared for when it goes. Our other car (120,000 2014 VW) is getting up there but has plenty of life left. I am just about to change jobs which requires a much higher rate of driving, higher salary, and car/gas coverage. 

**Finances**: We currently make a combined $150,000. I just accepted a new position which I will be starting next week which puts our earning potential closer to $225,000-$250,000 (sales, so more of a range). I will use $90K for monthly income as this was my previous salary and my new base which I would like to keep COL below. This job also pays me a $500/month stipend for car payments + all gas covered. Our total savings/investments are $200,000 pending the markets and we live on under $70,000/year (increased this past year with new home expenses and updates which we planned for, so closer to $50,000-$60,000 as we get back into a normal rhythm). We save/invest 60% between 401K, ROTH, HSA, and other investments. Have $25,000 cash emergency fund and about $10,000 cash account preparing for new car purchase. 

**Monthly**: income  $12,500 before tax/investments, so lets say $6,200 spending after tax/investments. Mortgage $1,400. Food $800 (roughly), insurance $160 (home and auto), and $350 bills/utility (gas, electric, phone, internet, subscriptions).

**Questions:** As mentioned, one of our cars is towards the end of life. My wife has a 3 hour commute two days/week and works from home the other three days. I will have a large increase in driving with my new job. the way I am looking at it is have my wife begin to driving the VW (115,000) and purchase a new car which I would drive. Given how markets are I am leaning towards new, around $30,000 (we like VW and Subaru and these are the average prices of models we like at current). Then drive the VW as long as possible (hopefully markets will calm down) and replace that car when needed.

My main question is, would the $500 stipend change your outlook on how to purchase a car or how to strategize finances? I normally would look at lightly used cars, pay for in full or pay off early, and drive until it cant drive anymore. With the increase of driving for work and the monthly stipend I am now thinking buy new for safety features and total longevity for the price. $500/month pays a 60 month loan on $30,000 so I should just let that ride as long as I have this perk. 

Second question, pending the above answers, would it then make sense to cycle through cars quicker? Putting higher mileage on a relatively young car with the company paying it off provides higher down payments when trading back in and covered monthly payments over the for seeable future or as long as I stay in this role.

The last piece I will add is that I completely understand and subscribe to only purchasing things we can withstand if jobs are lost and not overextending on a car because we want it. 30K would not necessarily overextend us but would be a little more car than I would go for without this role (new vs used) and car stipend. But we also need to play the cards of the market we are dealt and right now we are about to need a new car. We could easily cover the expense or sell the car if the worst happened but given the amount of time I will be in the car, my curiosity wanders... 

Thanks for any feedback!",finance,1667854714
personalfinance,What to do with Universal Life Insurance?,"I am relatively uninformed when it comes to personal finance and investing. One of the few tenets I think I ""know"" is Term Life insurance over Whole Life insurance/Universal Life. 

&amp;#x200B;

However, my (relatively) new job has a benefit for paying for a Universal life insurance policy for me. The job pays the premiums and I just pay taxes on the premiums as it is considered income. Under normal circumstances, I would not purchase life insurance at this time in my life - I have no dependents.  I enrolled when I was overwhelmed in the onboarding process and this was made to sound like a great deal. 

&amp;#x200B;

What am I supposed to do with such a policy. They tout taking a loan against the cash value but the interest rate is 8% on a loan. They tout an investment on a tax deferred basis but none of the investment options are anything I would choose on my own (I am strictly in low Exp Ratio index funds - VT, VTI, VXUS, BND). Currently the ""cash value"" is sitting in the fixed rate account earing 4% interest which is only a little more than my savings account emergency fund. 

\-How do I make the best of this policy? 

\-What are scenarios that I might benefit from the cash value loan or withdrawal? 

\-Is there something I'm missing about Universal Life policies that make them desirable?",finance,1667855183

My vet asked what I fed but never asked about changing it so im assuming its fine it just has me so confused on which food to go to. In the end I would like to do cooked raw with farmina possibly or just a fully cooked raw diet since I know some studies had concerns of salmonella.

bonds,Bonds pricing 101,"Hey r/bonds,

I'm fairly new to bonds and trying to understand how pricing works...

**Buying Bonds**

If I buy a 10-year bond at an interest rate of 5% for $10,000, I will receive $500 a year (paid at whatever interval) for the next 10 years, at the end of which I'll receive my $10k back, too (so $15k total).

What I don't understand is why a bond would go down or up in value. If I sell my bond at 5 years, the value of the bond is still $10k @ 5%.

I saw a clip on Bloomberg which talked about changes in interest rates being the primary cause: e.g., if 5-year bonds were 6% when I looked to sell the remaining 5 years on my 5% then the price would adjust to a fair market value = $10,000 \* 1% \* 5 = $9,500.  Is this the case?

Would the bond, therefore, go up if current rates were 4%?

Is there anything else that would affect the market price of a bond if sold before maturity?

This all seems fairly straightforward, own through maturation and everything would end as expected (assuming the company honors it's debt and isn't bankrupt), right?

**Buying Bond ETF**

What I am most confused about is bond ETFs.  If we look at the ticker BND, it shows an avg maturity of 8.9 years and a yield to maturity of 4.7%.  Using my same theory as above, if I bought $10,000 of BND today in 8.9 years, I would have my original $10k and have been paid $4,183 in yield over those 8.9 years.

Yet, had I bought BND \~9 years ago, I would have paid $80.89 (let's say 123x = $9,949.47), and today it's worth $69.63 at a value of $8,564.49.  I, therefore, wouldn't get original face value, despite holding through maturity.

&amp;#x200B;

Does this make sense? Am I off-target here? I just don't understand why anyone would buy BND and hold for 9 years when the price goes down; why wouldn't I just go and buy a bond at a similar yield for that period and be able to get the total face value back at maturity?

personalfinance,Should I stick with my HDHP?,"My company is offering a new plan this year that is awfully tempting, but my math is saying the HDHP plan still wins. We are a family of 5 with 3 boys, 10 and under. AKA high users of health services. We have a few specialists we see between us. I get labs done 3-4x a year. Someone is hurt a few times a year. We are firmly in the 24% federal tax bracket.

**Option 1 (current plan, although deductible and premiums are increasing for 2023)**

* HDHP, $3k/$6k deductible; OOP Max $3,425/$6,850
* 0% coinsurance after deductible (so I would think hitting the OOP Max would be difficult)
* Monthly premiums $334.86, plus company contributes $300/month to HSA
* Estimated OOP expense on this plan is somewhere between $5k and the OOP Max 

**Option 2 (New plan, EPO)**

* $0 deductible, $2k/$4k OOP Max
* Most things are free (labs, xrays, etc.) or have a small copay ($15 for all doctors, $100 for ER, etc.)
* Monthly premiums are $668.56
* Estimated OOP expense on this plan per year is around $1,000

Completely ignoring tax savings:

* Option 1 would cost us $4,018 in premiums PLUS $6,850 in OOP expenses (assuming we max out) MINUS $3,600 in company HSA contributions = $7,268 a year, and I'd have $4,150 in my HSA from my own contributions.
* Option 2 would cost us $8,023 in premiums PLUS $1,000 in OOP expenses = $9,023 per year. I would put roughly $1,200 in my FSA (excess would be used on glasses or OTC or whatever).

&amp;#x200B;

Given these numbers, is there any way for the EPO to make sense? I was playing around with it and it seems even if our usage goes way down, the HDHP is still the way to go (especially due to the 0% coinsurance).",finance,1667865143

I'm making plans to move overseas in summer of 2024 for a 1 year grad program, so we would only need the 2nd vehicle for 1.5 years. Does it make sense to buy used now with the current market? I have enough savings to buy a used vehicle with cash, however, I'm unsure if it'd be wise to buy with the current market and run the risk of going through savings while I'm trying to save for said move. On the other hand, not having a car is limiting my ability to get around. Do I buy used now and just sell it before moving, in the hopes of making back some of my money?

Single male about to become a home owner of a 3 bed, 2 bath house.  My best friend and I (since 7th grade) have always wanted to move in with each other so we could game and just be homies and support each other.

He plans on joining me once he handles things on his end.  I should have the house before then.

Initially he wanted to go 50/50 on  the house buying process, but based on our current locations and situations, I deemed it as a terrible idea.  We're not homosexual, so we'll never be married to each other, and buying a house with someone you aren't married to sounds like a terrible idea if one person experiences a life changing event and needs to move.

So I went ahead and bought the house and I'm just going to charge him rent at a homie discount to live with me.  The purpose of the rent is solely to help me with the mortgage, as interest rates have made monthly payments a doozy.

My question is: Should I create my own LLC and treat him like an ordinary tennant?  Or should we just do everything as is with promises of rent being paid?  He IS my childhood friend and I have no doubt in my mind that we'll ever come to some sort of quarrel, but there's a voice in my head telling me to do this officially.

That being said, how would you all handle renting to someone but also living in the same house? Should I just print a blank rent agreement from online and have him sign? Should I open up an LLC?

I plan on charging a flat amount for the room (with the homie discount) plus 50% of all utility bills, since we'll be using that equally.  Is that fair?",finance,1667870912

personalfinance,I Need Loan Advice *Urgent*,"Thank you in advance for giving this post the time of the day, because God knows I am in quite the predicament and could use some wisdom.

I am going to be pretty vague regarding the specifics in respect for my privacy. Basically, here’s the situation:
I am in my young 20’s, graduated college recently and accepted a pretty good job in sales with about 85k OTE. I have been building my credit for years, take investing serious and I am very disciplined with my budget. I am relatively frugal and have been able to build my credit to roughly 740.

A close loved-one recently suffered a sudden and border-line disabling injury. As a result, that loved-one, who has helped me out an endless amount of times while I was growing up needs, help. They are behind on all of their bills and running out of mine all while having a family to support. Until they are able to get approved for disability and get back up on their feet they need help. That help is co-signing on a personal loan for $10,000. This person can not get a personal loan because their business went under as a result of this injury and they have no proof-of-income until their disability comes in (which will only be ~$2,000/mo).

Now, is quite literally, one of the WORST times in history to get a personal loan. I have worked tirelessly to keep my debt to a minimum. My net worth not that much higher than the loan amount right now (just getting started in life don’t judge me too hard).

Now to the point of this post:
How do I NOT get screwed on this loan? Anything I can do to protect myself? Any way to prevent a significant hit to my credit (roughly $20k line as of now)

More importantly, I have an idea. I can borrow roughly $4,000 from M1 finance at 5.75%. Unfortunately, this rate is variable and I am not entirely sure what will happen to it when my M1+ expires in April, as I have no intention to renew it, and how much this interest will actually end up calling me.

I’ve done a bit of research online and found some interest rates as low as 10%. Should I do the $4,000 at 5.75% and $6,000 at ~10% for 36 months, or should I just do it all at ~10% for ease of payment/interest calculator. Are the potential savings worth the money?

My roof isn’t great for solar. It’s south facing, but there’s an awkward dormer because it’s a cape. Trinity told me they could squeeze a system that would do on average, 290 kWh each month onto my roof. This is 55-60% of my usage, which will only increase, as we’re shopping for a heat pump.

Trinity won’t give me a number for how much this would cost yet, as they’re pushing a PPA and saying they don’t know the real cost (I know this is BS). When I put these numbers into Tesla’s calculator, they said I could buy a system from them that would do this for about $15k before credits.

CryptoCurrency,Algorand: Bit of a Deep Dive,"The Marshall Islands is a country with a population of around 50,000 dispersed over a thousand different islands in a remote portion of the Pacific Ocean. The country is strongly reliant on cross-border trade and finance and the systems intricacies can make it difficult for individuals to obtain certain goods and financial services in a timely manner. The federal government of the Marshall Islands has adopted a digital currency named SOV. SOV is actually powered by Algorand and cryptocurrency experts believe that this move from the Marshall Islands will help curb high transaction costs, making it easier to comply with international partners and safeguard them against inflation. 

So what is Algorand and what made the Marshall Islands decide to accept it for their own currency?

Algorand is a decentralized network designed to solve the blockchain trilemma of speed, security, and decentralization all at the same time. It was created by a team led by Silvio Micali at MIT. 

The Algorand project is designed to be a blockchain similar to Ethereum, but with faster transactions and with a strong focus on achieving near instant completion. 

Algorand uses a pure proof-of-stake (PPoS) protocol built on Byzantine consensus. Each user’s influence on the choice of a new block is proportional to its stake in the system. Users are randomly and secretly selected to propose blocks and vote on block proposals. All online users have the chance to be selected to propose and vote. The likelihood that a user will be chosen, and the weight of its proposals and votes, are directly proportional to its stake.

Algorand’s PPoS approach ties the security of the whole economy to the honesty of the majority of the economy, rather than to that of a small subset of the economy. The system is secure when most of the money is in honest hands. In Algorand, it is impossible for the owners of a small fraction of the money to harm the whole system, and it would be foolish for the owners of the majority of the money to misbehave as it would diminish the currency’s purchasing power and ultimately devalue their own assets.

Algorand has recently upgraded its blockchain to have the follow specifications:

Transactions per second: 6,000

Blockchain finality in \~3.7 seconds

Bullish. 

Algorand recently introduced State Proofs for trustless cross chain communication. Blockchain ecosystems are like cities: each one provides value that draws people to visit — business opportunities, community, entertainment, infrastructure, etc. As crypto matured, people will have more reasons to visit different ecosystems, driving more value into cross-chain applications. In order to access your source blockchain in new ecosystems (I.e. I’m visiting Ethereum chain from my source of algorand), you need a reliable way to verify its ‘state’ (snapshot of account balances and transactions) in the new environment. This trustless infrastructure is currently missing from the market, so people have turned to trusted intermediaries, like bridges, to handle their assets. Algorand State Proofs are a new interoperability standard that extends trustless interactions beyond a blockchain’s native ecosystem (very cool!). Through light clients (software that tracks blockchain state), they provide a simple, trustless interface to build powerful applications conditioned by multiple blockchains’ events. State proofs can be implemented on all proof of stake chains and will accelerate the path towards true decentralization! Bullish. 

Algorand is a quantum resistant blockchain. To be entirely fair, I still don’t understand this point, so I won’t comment on it. Just a buzzword that I read everywhere, even on Algorand’s official site. 📷 

Algorand does not fork (so there are no two ‘legitimate ledgers’ that can exist in parallel). This avoids double spending and backwards compatibility issues. TLDR; forks are bad and because Algorand doesn’t fork, this is good. 

Tokenomics and the Great Inflation of ALGO

The supply of ALGO is capped at 10 billion with Algorand Inc and Foundation holding a total of 25% of all ALGO (2.5 billion). Not the most decentralized crypto, but gives Inc and Foundation enough incentive to ensure the healthy growth and development of Algorand. Crabbish?

Inflation of Algorand over the last year was staggeringly high. This likely has a strong influence on why the price of ALGO has been suppressed. This was due to early completion of accelerated vesting, an initiative by the Algorand foundation to encourage early backers and node runners to help get the ecosystem running. With the end of this vesting program, inflation is set to be MUCH lower in the coming years. 

Algorand also has additional factors like partnerships with FIFA, their hands in funding all sorts of blockchain-related research teams at universities, government adoption, etc… but that’s less about the technology of Algorand. 

Overall, I’m quite bullish on Algorand. The one area that has me concerned is the lack of developers on the chain. While there are many dApps in development (a recent number I heard was over 2,000), I’m never one to rely on the hopes of development \*cough\* Lookin at you, Charles \*cough\*. 

Please let me know if I missed anything in my analysis. I know I’m not a crypto genius, so please comment if I misrepresented something or if you have anything to add! 

Another argument against Algorand I have heard is that Algorand foundation decides to which relay nodes information is sent. In my own searching, I wasn’t able to find anything related to this info, but I’d be happy if anyone could send a source on it! 

Cheers!

Edit: I tagged the post 'pro-arguments', as I mostly found positive things about the blockchain, but this search was intended to be an overall view of Algorand.",cryptocurrency,1667875594
CryptoCurrency,How is everyone feeling after the SEC v LBRY ruling?,"Many of you are likely aware that the SEC won its case against LBRY today. For those that don't know about LBRY, LBRY, is/was a blockchain-based file-sharing and payment network that powers decentralized platforms, primarily social networks and video platforms. LBRY's creators also created Odysee, an open-source video-sharing website that uses the network, and that was split into a separate company on October 1, 2021. Odysee was basically a decentralized youtube that allowed people to tip content creators.

The SEC sued LBRY last March and won its case today. The following information is from the SEC's press release on the case: ""\[t\]he SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and civil penalties. The SEC's complaint alleged that, from at least July 2016 to February 2021, LBRY, which provides a video sharing application, sold crypto asset securities called ""LBRY Credits"" to numerous investors, including investors based in the US. The complaint alleges that this was an offering and sale of securities under the federal securities laws, and that LBRY did not file a registration statement for the offering. The complaint further alleges that by failing to file a registration statement, LBRY denied prospective investors the information required for such an offering to the public.""

This case is relevant because it puts most of the cryptocurrency market/ industry in the SEC's crosshairs. It is also relevant because the SEC will most likely use the LBRY ruling in its case against Ripple Labs, and probably the Coinbase employees that were charged with insider trading too. While it should be noted that LBRY relied on the fair notice defense, and Ripple Labs is arguing that XRP fails the Howey test, this really wasn't great news to hear.

One of the SEC's main arguments was that LBRY pre-mined its tokens, and kept a portion of those tokens for itself, and also that the LBC token did not have a use case when it was first created. How do you think centralized exchange tokens like BNB , CRO, FTT, Gemini dollar and others will be affected by this ruling? What about Tether?

I think that each coin/its founders will have to argue that their token fails the Howey test, or that fair notice was not given. I don't think that the LBRY ruling will act as a blanket ban on the cryptos we know and love. I do think that the cryptocurrency industry will continue to feel uneasy while current and additional SEC cases are litigated. I think it is annoying that the SEC can say ""you didn't give prosepctive investors information required for such an offering"" when no one knows shit about fuck. Being more serious, it's annoying that while the SEC is arguing securities laws were broken, it is ultimately the hodlers of the tokens that are harmed by the decrease in price that inevitably results from a crypto being deemed a security.

It's my opinion that bitcoin is probably the most safe (as everyone has been saying) from the SEC. For the short-mid term, that's what I will be focusing my DCA on.

So, what are everyone's thoughts on today's ruling? How do you feel? Are you buying more, keeping your DCA, or holding off until more news? Wen Lambo?

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR: SEC won its case against LBRY today. How are you feeling about it?

Edit: updated information about the Coinbase employees the SEC charged with insider trading.",cryptocurrency,1667876232
CryptoCurrency,Bring out your Crystal Balls,"Hi everyone,

Obviously there’s a lot of drama going on in crypto right now and there has been throughout this bear market.

We’ve seen the collapse of Luna, Celcius and other exchanges getting rekt. Also, now FTT is tanking and everything seems to be a mess. To those of you who are still here, congrats! Maybe our lives will be changed in the not so distant future.

Anyways, the reason for my post. How far through this bear market do you all think we are? It seems the FEDs are still hawkish but could they be pivoting soon ish? When do you think a reversal could come? What needs to happen for a reversal?

I’m of the opinion that obviously once interest rates come down that a reversal will start there. Just my opinion and I very well could be wrong due to macro economic uncertainty.

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!",cryptocurrency,1667881453
personalfinance,"WWYD, offered deal on car, wasn’t planning on purchase yet.","Situation:  I sold my old beater a few months back and have been borrowing my mothers car, at her urging. She gets a vehicle through work, but that will be going away in the new year. The company is giving the employees first choice to buy the cars at a reasonable price. My mother is asking if I want the deal on the car. I wasn’t planning on buying a new car yet because my partner has a car that we could share if it came down to it (this is what we were planning on anyway once my mom wanted her car back). 

The car: 21’ Subaru Forester, 20,900 miles AWD great condition. Not sure on the trim package, my guess is like base/low end sport?  

The Deal: They are selling for $14,900. KBB is around $24,000, Carmax would purchase for $18,000. 

I wasn’t planning on buying a car because I have been saving pretty aggressively for a house and although I have around 20% as planned, with interest rates and all the rest I wanted to keep my DTI as low as possible. It does seem like a good deal tho and I didn’t want to miss out on an opportunity and the thought did cross my mind to try and flip it for the extra cash. 

Edit: My financial situation would allow me to purchase the car for cash or finance. As I have been saving around $2000/month for the house and although I have met my goal, the current economic climate continues to slowly move my goal posts so I was going to prioritize saving if nothing came up. 

So PF WWYD?

CryptoCurrency,Here's a crypto conspiracy theory,"Crypto is no different (in its current life cycle) to any other financial or political instrument that the less than 1% of people control and manipulate to make ordinary people poorer and less able to get ahead for themselves and their families. 

I don't believe any of the crap that Elon Musk talks, he intentionally pumped and dumped doge. His ' plans ' for crypto is to just manipulate it to grow his own financial standing and power among those less than 1% of people that rule over the rest of society.

It's all a puppet show, if you learn to read between the lines you can make yourself rich with it, does that make it wrong? I'm not personally complaining, but I'm under no illusions as to the bullshit that this space lives and feeds on to stay afloat. 

This whole Binance and FTX thing is also bullshit, do you really think 2 billionaires really give a single shit about morals or ethics? Neither of these dudes ' care ' about crypto and any person that falls for this pick a side crap is just feeding into the never ending maelstrom of shit and manipulation that the few in the know use to line their pockets a little harder each time.

Every single time there's been large drops in the market recently, there were several months of hints in news articles about monetary policy or some other scare tactic that made it obvious the market would drop. Then they post a random thing like the FTX dump to make you think that the crypto market is some ' decentralized ' entity that operates separately and has its own reasons for pumping and dumping by the billions each day. The fact that so many people don't ask the most basic question, like how many billionaires are there and how many people can actually manipulate the market is scary. 

How do some people think this FTX thing isn't all theatre gearing up to 2023 when the markets are really going to dump much much harder than now. I've warned in several old posts and got downvoted each time. Learn to play the game of crypto, because that's all it is until the space matures.",cryptocurrency,1667884878

CryptoCurrency,Bitcoin is a solution to the problem of American Hegemony,"Everyone keeps saying ""Blockchain is a solution in search of a problem."" It's not.  


Bitcoin solves one very big problem for some, but for a certain few others it doesn't seem like a problem at all: United States Dollar Hegemony.  


The United States of America is the only country in the world that gets to print as much (or in the current case, as little) money as they want, and *the rest of the world has to suffer the consequences*. We are seeing this happen right now.  


Obviously, this isn't a problem at all if you're the United States Federal Government (notice I said ""government"" and not the people: because there are some serious structural problems \*within\* the United States, but that's a discussion for another time).  


The Feds / The Fed (because ""technically"" they're not even the same institution) feel justified in wielding this power. Hell, they won World War II for this power. They deserve this power. And the overarching narrative is: this is good for us all. The world has seen unprecedented peace and prosperity ever since the United States acted as a global guarantor of trade. The United States SHOULD be the ""World Police"". ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtJJC0nWs9s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtJJC0nWs9s) )  


Until of course, 2008, when the Feds bailed out the banks, and in response Satoshi Nakamoto made Bitcoin.  


The problem is that this very clear cut answer to why blockchain technology could revolutionize the world (and remember it seems very clear that anything that facilitates trade generally forces the parties involved to be *non-violent* to each other, such is the core thesis of why neoliberal capitalism is a force for good) will ultimately disadvantage even your normal everyday Americans. It's impossible to redistribute financial power in such a radical way without some disruption. It is no less than a radical redistribution  


And of course, there is the very real and undeniable argument that all this could be, at the end of the day, is the trading off of an old traditional finance elite for a new Web3 decentralized finance elite: Alameda, Binance, Coinbase, etc.  


But still: replacing a problematic former elite with a new elite is still solving the problem of US Dollar Hegemony.

The only major difference is that the so called ""degen strategy""( to use Luna as collateral at anchor to get ust, with which you buy more Luna and repeat) is that Kwon let outsiders playing the game(and loosing their money), and the fact that he doesn't touched USD directly, but through the whole market via UDT. Now,it becomes obvious for me that SBF has a very strong joker in the FED, because such manipulation is at the very least what one calls ""money laundering"" and it's probably much worse than just that.

&gt; Investors are awaiting Tuesday’s midterm election results. They will determine which party controls Congress and steer future policy and spending. Market participants will watch whether Republicans take back the House of Representatives, the Senate or both.
*****
&gt; “The financial market reaction to a Republican win should be muted, as the House outcome is already widely expected, and the Senate outcome makes less of a difference to policy outcomes if Republicans control the House,” Goldman Sachs’ Jan Hatzius wrote in a Monday note.
*****
&gt; “A surprise Democratic win in the House and Senate would likely weigh on equities, as market participants might expect additional corporate tax increases,” Hatzius added.
*****
&gt; Wall Street will also closely watch Thursday’s consumer price index report for the latest data on how much the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes have tamed high inflation. This reading could also signal the central bank’s path forward – another hotter-than-anticipated report could embolden the Fed to raise rates aggressively in December.

vet,My cat won't eat much after getting vaccinated,"I'd like to know if this constitutes a vet visit. My 12-week old kitten just had her second round of vaccines this past Saturday, and she's had some side-effects. The first day, she was a bit more timid, but now she's back to her normal self. But yesterday she stopped eating her food. I managed to hand feed her some dry pellets in the morning (only a small handfull), and then i hand fed her some patte mixed with kitty gravy in the evening (i mixed them together because she was licking her normal food, so i thought that maybe she'd be able to eat more of jt if it was more liquidy, but she didnt finish it), and I gave her some of her favorite treats throughout the day(which were the only thing that she ate immediately).



Today, she hasn't touched her food at all, my partner and I are both leaving for work right now, but I'll be back during my lunch break since I work close to home so I can check on her. She's still acting like her normal self, she has her zoomies, and she still drives me insane lol, but I'm really worried about her not eating. Normally she'll scarf it down super quickly.



We also found what I think is throwup at the foot of out bed this morning. I'm not entirely sure, at first we thought it was poop because of how thick it was (it looked like patte mixed with kibble, dried up, and kicked around a bit), but it didn't look like her normal poop, so we think it was throwup. She's perfectly clean though, so maybe she just cleaned herself up really well. It was also the first night that we let her sleep with us, so maybe that was just too stressful for her? I checked on her throughout the night (she slept on my pillow) and she looked like she was sleeping okay, but I mightve missed something.



Please let me know if this requires a vet visit, or if there's anything I can do to help her eat!! Thanks in advance!!



Edit: she also got her leukemia vaccine during this visit, I don't know if that changes anything!!",cryptocurrency,1667916542

The last 2 weeks I have been cutting my cash on hand percentage from 75% to 50%. I do understand that the Federal Reserve is still hiking rates and in previous post, I have warned against speculating on a Pivot. However, I realized that most companies have significantly cut their guidance which allows the market to price in new certainties. Their warning on a demand slowdown should be a precursor to waning inflation. Furthermore, the market has enjoyed relative calmness to the turmoil in Large Cap tech stocks over the past month. This may be a sign that investors are beginning to accept that profits and revenue will be down and that these new slashed stock prices are reflective of their true value and therefore forming protection for further downside.

I take zero credit for the content:,"Crypto ape checking in. From what I understand Sam Bankman fried owns FT. He has been working on federal legislation namely something called a ""bit license"" which would seek to require KYC (know your customer i.e. require a driver's license or passport) for all crypto transactions... even those on decentralized exchanges which don't currently require KYC.

KYC flies in the face of the crypto thesis which is decentralized autonomous transactions.
FTX has been buying up tons of at risk crypto exchanges and has become an absolutely juggernaut in the cryptospace. If FTX and BF were to be successfull pushing crypto legislation they would have a strangle hold on the industry. Also edit to add FTX has deep ties to Blackrock.

Binance didn't like this and moved to liquidate all their holdings of the FTX token causing downward pressure on the price of FTX. FTX had an investment arm called “Alameda research"" who has supposedly leveraged the FTX token for possible sketchy investments. If the price of FTX dips far below its current value of $22.00 we may see serious margin calls and they may be liquidated similar to the LUNA fiasco we saw earlier this summer.

Long story short, the 2 largest behemoths in the crypto space are trading punches and all crypto users will suffer.

One other peice of the puzzle is the SEC won a serious victory over a crypto company called library today and declares that were offering crypto tokens for sale as unregistered securities. This could put ALL crypto currencies in the US in jeopardy of bring deemed unregistered securities which would be potentially disastrous.

personalfinance,Benefits of Bond Index ETFs vs CD/HYSA,"Hello,
As the title states I am confused about the benefits of investing in a bond index ETF as compared to a CD or a high yield savings account.

My HYSA has gone from .8% APY to recently 2.75% APY. I know that this isn't locked in for any period of time like a bond.

CD yields do lock in for whatever term a person is comfortable with and you get diminishing returns as you get past 2 years terms but you get a premium of 1-2% vs a HYSA.

Most Bond ETF face value has dipped as interest rates have gone up, but the yield seems low still.  An example is BND with its face value is down (16.14%). So a person is getting a discount while yields rise, but the coupon is at 2.7% so it yields less than a HYSA. So if rates continue to go up the face value/principle will go down but the yield will go up but not at the premium of a CD. You have more liquidity versus a CD though.

Can anyone clarify what situations would motivate a person to choose this investment option?

I am not sure I understand what the avg coupon is compared to the yield to maturity. I also am not looking for investment advice, rather to better understand why someone would choose a Bond Index ETF vs a CD or HYSA for surplus long term savings.",finance,1667925535

For Prop B, we also want to sell it, but we will 1) not have owned it a full 2 years, and 2) if we rent it out sell later down the line, we will have to pay capital gains taxes as it will be a rental (we would not have lived in it 2 out of the 5 years). 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on this, what would you advise we do with Prop B? Should we rent it out for a while? Should we take a hit and just sell it, and pay the taxes, so we can buy a bigger home in the new state? We might actually not owe that much because we put a lot of work into that house, and it hasn't appreciated much due to rising interest rates the last year.",finance,1667936342
personalfinance,First personal loan help ($4000 for vehicle),"I know Reddit might not be the best place for financial advice, but I’m trying to get a baseline of where to start.

I need a $4000 loan for a vehicle. I’m considering the personal loan route.

What are the pros/cons of using an online service (like Experion, Lending Tree.. I know Experion is part of the Credit Bureau) versus a local bank? Will be looking into Experian first.

personalfinance,How to financially behave right now while building a house?,"Hello, and thank you for reading this post.  


I know we are all in difficult situation right now, yet i do hope a community here would help a noob like me to at least put on a better path for learning, as i feel a bit lost.  


Some BG info: 

Me &amp; my now pregnant wife + 2 kids started building a house earlier this year, trying to avoid putting ourselves in debt as much as possible. 

We scraped all of our savings but still had to get a small personal loan to get to the state of walls + roof. Now we stopped, waiting for our third child.

We live in a small appartment, which is thankfully ours, but we bought it as a couple with no kids, and right now it really starts getting crumped.

We prepared to take a mortage a month ago, but interest rates were enormous where we live. 

Right now it hiked a little bit again and it looks like we'll be paying back around 3 times more than we would lend. The only thing which is good is bank margin which is really low right now, but getting the morgage in hopes that interest rates will fall soon seems like gambling really.

We are considering to actually skip the morgage for now and take more personal loans to finance next building stages / or to just stop building and wait and see where situation the market will be going, but that also makes the risk of interest rates just going up and up until (maybe?) we'll be out of creditworthiness of the bank.

Yet again on the other hand, you hear voices that, due to inflation, the prices of services will skyrocket soon.

On the other hand we could do some installations ourselves and move on as ""bare minimum"" as we could, eventually selling the old property  and using that money to finance finishing of the new house.

I'm trying to follow the financial markets daily to learn as much as i can and get my family in the best position to this situation, and to hopefully, get the the 'moving day' as soon as possible.

I would really appreciate any insings or opinion on, those strategies, and how to educate myself better to get better loan (or to avoid getting screwed over by some really bad deal loan)

Maybe you yourself were in similar position and have some other, more clever strategy to move forward?

I really appreciate your help!

This one takes the cake. From multiple angles, this the most caricaturized microcosm of the problems plaguing surveillance coins. But okay, from the beginning ...

This dude found an error on Silk Road, and was able to keep withdrawing the same funds repeatedly, and lifted 50k BTC off Ross Ulbrict. Like a good maxi, hodled almost all of it. Even dumped his BCH. 

Predictably, he failed (refused?) to wash it through Monero.

Then in 2019, he sent a (separate) stash of 118 BTC to a KYC exchange. In the txn, he received back [get this] ***0.07*** to a change address. Unfortunately, that UTXO was associated with the Silk Road coins he lifted. 

Billions of dollars, gone. Months in jail. Over a ***0.07*** in transaction change. 

This guy wasn't some newb. He's been in it since the beginning. No doubt this maxi knew about security, UTXO managment, etc. *Point is, if this guy can't get it right, neither can 99.99% of everyone else.*

In response to this story, I saw someone say:

&gt; It probably would've taken years to wash it with Monero

Which is literally what everyone says every single time this happens. So let's break this down, a bit. Let's see how ludicrous this notion is.

So these stories are a dime a dozen now: Tens/hundreds of hackers out there over the past decade, each with 10,000 or more BTC, who then get pwned years after the fact. Despite having billions of dollars and a made life, decide that they don't want to endure the slippage of getting into XMR.

Imagine if they had done the right thing (not just morally, but just to save their own asses) ... Imagine if they had dropped even 10% of those funds into XMR, and accepted the price slippage. What kind of social attention (hype), marketcap, additional investment, and of course volumes that the ***collective action*** of these hundreds of individuals would have caused by moving that much BTC into XMR.

Together, they would literally have created the market and conditions for Monero; which would have largely solved literally the only real problem that they had. Which of course is:  ***don't get fucking caught.*** 

But no. They're always like, ""*There's not enough muhnero liquidity to wash my funds. I guess I'll just keep messing around in Bitcoin,  eventually fuck up, and go to prison instead.*""

They had the opportunity to do something truly good for the world, get Monero the attention and price it deserves. They even had the opportunity to save their own ass by just converting to XMR over the years, accepting the slippage, and calling it a day. The 2018/19 bear market was a perfect opportunity for them. It still is a perfect opportunity even now.",cryptocurrency,1667946942

I am new to US and learning about various investment strategies like: CD, I bonds etc.

Means, After 9 months, I should get My principle amount+interest(for 9 months, calculated as 3% per annum interest rate). That's my expectation.

investing,How to derive T-bond price from interest and high yield at competitive auction?,"I am trying to understand how the T-bond price is calculated from the interest rate and high yield during the competitive bidding process. I understand the a single-price dutch auction process is used to determine the yield.

Let's use the [11/08/2022 3 Year Note results](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/instit/annceresult/press/preanre/2022/R_20221108_1.pdf) as an example. IIUC, the important bits:

- Interest Rate: 4.5%
- High Yield: 4.605%
- Price: $99.708904
- Face Value: $100

I am guessing that the price is a function of interest rate and high yield, but do not understand exactly how. I did not study finance in school so I've been trying to pick up things from Investopedia. Let's take the example above and say I buy **1** note. Here's what I understand so far:

- If I submit a non-competitive bid for $100 worth of T-notes, I will be granted **1** T-note at a price of $99.708904.
- Interest on T-notes doesn't auto-compound. So for the example above, I will be paid $99.708904 x 4.5% x 3 years = $13.46070204 in interest if I hold the T-note to maturity.
- I also understand that T-notes pay interest every 6 months. So for the example above, it would really be 6 interest payments of 99.708904 x (4.5% / 2) = $2.24345034.
- Once the note reaches maturity, I am paid the face value. So for the example above, I would be paid $100 at the end of 3 years.
- I will thus earn $13.46070204 + $100 - $99.708904 = $13.75179804 from this T-note if I hold the T-note to maturity.

Since interest on T-notes doesn't auto-compound, I am calculating the annual (not geometric annualized) return as ($13.75179804 / $99.708904) / 3 years = 0.04597315281. This is slightly less than the high yield of 4.605%. If annualized return ($13.46070204 + $100) / $99.708904) ^ (1/3) - 1 = 0.0440080354 is even less.

&amp;#x200B;

# But why?

Beside the huge impact of the fall of FTX and it's token FTT ( and the related Solana dump ) the entire topic is pretty clear : FTX messed up. And when one of the largest exchanges with one of the best reputations falls like that it's a **big hit to the trust in crypto. And I'm not just talking about the investor trust but also the politics behind it**. There has been a lot of bills they tried to push for crypto that are most likely dead now. This is putting crypto in a bad spot and view from governments around the world which is enough for institutions / whales to cash out and move their funds out of crypto.

# What about the future?

As I mentioned above one of the main reason for the dump is the lack of trust. And it is important to keep in mind that the global economics are in a really bad shape. Inflation is still not under control, war, shortages &amp; other factors keep having a negative impact on the world economics.The recession we are in for months starts showing it's impact as well. Bad earning reports for bluechip stocks and lay offs everywhere. And when it comes to interest rate hikes the federal reserve made it very clear that a it is ""very premature to think about pausing"".

Additionally, [CPI release is coming on the 10th november](https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/cpi.htm) that always caused volatility in the crypto markets. The release will most likely have a huge impact on the stock market if not even decide the direction for the next week and crypto will follow it. Safe to say the volatility will be huge.

Today Bitcoin fell through the lowest value of the bear market to a level of 2020. But the support was strong enough to push it back into the $18000 range and even further above. The volume spiked to a new high of  760.367k in a day. Bitcoin dominance remains above 40%.

Generally speaking the support in crypto is still strong even after such a blackswan event. But the next days / weeks will be very important if it keeps holding. Some see it as a fire sale, some take the chance to trade and for some it was the last push to exit the market.

**TL;DR** : It's been a chaotic day and crypto prices took a heavy hit. **The fundamentals haven't changed**. But the next days / weeks will be interesting. It's impossible to speculate if this was another bottom hit and will recover from here or if prices will continue to fall.

Remaining balance is $86,900 on a 3.250% interest rate. When I hit 20% should I call my lender and notify them to see if I’m eligible to eliminate PMI? I’m not sure what to do here and I just want to pay off more principal and get this giant bill off my hands as soon as possible. 

Any help is appreciated.

personalfinance,"How should I save for a downpayment? I work for a big tech company, had rapidly rising pay, and I am majorly paid in stock that has tanked.","Hello.

I am in my early 30s, and looking to buy a home for the first time. For some context on my situation, I went to university, grad school, and dropped out of getting a PhD to join a tech company. I racked up a lot of student loans and personal debt during my college years. I also lived in a very high cost of living area. I graduated with credit card debt, student loan debt, and medical problems that I could not afford to address for both me and my wife.

I have been working for five years, and my pay is high, and has rapidly risen. But I have no cash at all for a down payment, and I feel like starting now is impossible to catch up to what I can ""afford monthly payments on"", especially as my earnings keep increasing (hopefully, more on that later maybe).

During my working time:

* My earnings *rapidly* increased. In year 4, I as making 2.6x more than I was in year 1, and I had doubled it by year 3. But now my pay has scaled back over 35% due to stock reductions.
* We paid off the credit card debt
* Majorly reduced student loan debt (paused that because its at 3% interest and its currently frozen)
* Got a ton of medical and dental procedures to get healthy
* Saved a 6-month ""necessity"" efund
* Have saved \~20% of my total gross earnings in my HSA+IRAs+401k (flat performance as most savings are in past two years, with this year *majorly frontloaded*...sigh...), but I still have $300k in retirement accounts

I made a lot of money through promos and strong stock performance. I aggressively targeted debt payoff, then retirement accounts, but have ignored saving for a home. 

It seems like my options are some combination of:

* Downsize my lifestyle to save for a better one in the future
* Stop contributing to post-tax 401k
* 401k loan ($50k)
* Roth 401k hardship withdrawal (there is only like a $2,000 penalty to take out $100k, because its all after tax money and I have nearly zero gains lol)
* Wait years and hope that my company stock rebounds faster than the real estate market and interest rates do, while continuing to pay rent

How important really is owning a home versus renting? Would I be crazy to dip into my retirement accounts to prioritize buying a home sooner than later if the right home comes along within the next year?",finance,1667978559

personalfinance,Multiple Concurrent Balance Transfers w/ Differing Promo Periods,"Hey all, was hoping to find answers to a situation that I'm currently in. Given multiple balance transfers from the same company with equivalent promotional interest rates but differing expiration dates, how does the company apply payments?

&amp;#x200B;

For reference, I have an existing balance transfer w/ a 0% promo interest rate from 5/1/22 - 5/1/23. I want to avoid paying interest, so I have autopay set to a fixed amount that'll pay off the entire balance before the promo expiration date. For the sake of the argument, let's say the current remaining balance of this transfer is $7.5k as of 11/1/22.

I then applied for a second balance transfer w/ the same company which also has a 0% promo interest rate from 11/1/22 - 11/1/23. For the sake of the argument, let's say the second balance transfer was for $10k.

I figured I could simply increase my autopay amount by a fixed amount that would continue to pay off the remaining $7.5k balance from the first balance transfer by 5/1/23, while concurrently paying off second balance transfer by 11/1/23. However, I failed to realize the company may not apply my payment as I had thought.

&amp;#x200B;

I did some research, but I wasn't able to find anything on my exact situation. Most articles that I found focused on multiple balances w/ different interest rates. For instance, this [article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/how-credit-card-payments-applied) mentions companies must apply any excess payment above the minimum payment to the balance w/ the higher interest due to the Credit Card Act.  
However, this is the exact scenario I'm trying to avoid - I don't want to be in a situation where one balance has a higher interest than the other. I want the interest rates of both balances to remain equal at 0% until they are completely paid off before their respective promo expiration dates.

My main concern is that they'll apply 100% of my payments to the second balance transfer such that the balance of my first transfer remains at $7.5k when its promo period ends on 5/1/23. Is there some FIFO rule that distinguishes multiple balance transfers from a single company by promo expiration dates?",finance,1667986108

CryptoCurrency,"Happy ATHversary: exactly one year ago, today, Bitcoin was touching its ""All Time High"" value at ~U$69,045.00.","Happy ATHversary my dudes, you all made it.

https://preview.redd.it/n8q36v0qfwy91.png?width=948&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=fc37a7be2f8bb63a2063d7e9da87065a9bfce2d3

We're down approximately 69.83% from the ATH values, and generally bear markets see Bitcoin dropping from 80% to 93% before resuming to a depressing accumulation phase.

&amp;#x200B;

* 2011–2012: -93% retrace
* 2012–2013: -80% retrace
* 2013-2014: -86% retrace
* 2017-2018: -84.5% retrace
* 2021-2022: ~~-69%~~ 75% retrace so far

For Bitcoin to do conclude another 80% retrace it would need to be priced at about **U$13,609.00**, meaning a further \~15% drop. Of course the possibility exists the retrace is stronger this time, specially if you consider the FED trying to halt the US economy with rate hikes, which tend to strangulate speculative investments like crypto. It's also possible this is the first retrace that doesn't conclude at 80% and we're seeing the worst right now.

It should also be noted that Crypto has never existed in a ""FED is rising the rates"" environment, as since 2008 interest rates have been kept very low even when the economy was ""booming"" (2016-2020).

&amp;#x200B;

Lastly it should also be noted nobody knows shit about fuck, but if you're buying now you're obviously doing a much more efficient accumulation than the idiots buying at U$60,000.00 rooting for ""100K EOY 2021!"", so good job I guess.",cryptocurrency,1667988773

# [Stock futures fall slightly as control of Congress is still unclear](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/08/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-wall-street-awaits-results-of-midterm-elections.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were slightly lower — following recent market gains — as results of the midterm elections provided no clear answers about who would control Congress yet.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 123 points, or about 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures shed 0.3% and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.3%.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off three-straight days of gains into the election, where Wall Street was expecting Republicans to gain ground and block any future tax and spending plans. The Dow climbed 333 points on Tuesday for its third-straight session of gaining more than 1%.
*****
&gt; But control of Congress was not clear. NBC News was not yet projecting control of the House of Representatives with an NBC estimate suggesting Republicans could win 220 seats, which would be a narrow majority.
*****
&gt; In one of the key races that could determine Senate control, Democrat John Fetterman defeated Republican Mehmet Oz for the pivotal Senate seat in Pennsylvania, according to an NBC News projection. Oz had the backing of former President Donald Trump, whose endorsed candidates saw spotty levels of success across the country. Critical Senate races in Georgia and Nevada were unresolved.
*****
&gt; “It looks like the strong Republican win that was anticipated yesterday did not happen, and that reduces the chance of the Congress and the Senate extremely lowering spending of the President,” said Bokeh Capital’s Kim Forrest.
*****
&gt; While the election captivated market attention, investors may want to move on now as the Federal Reserve raises interest rates to bring down inflation, potentially tipping the economy into recession.
*****
&gt; The political landscape “will fascinate the Washington chattering class, but for the markets, the focus will shift to whether a recession looms, whether the Fed will end its tightening this winter, and whether a truce and negotiations are possible in the Ukraine war,” wrote Greg Valliere, chief U.S. policy strategist at AGF Investments.
*****
&gt; The market’s recent rally occurred at the front end of a strong seasonal period. Historically, stocks tend to rise after midterm elections and the policy clarity it brings, and the final two months of the year are considered a bullish period for investors.
*****
&gt; Shares of Facebook parent Meta Platforms rose 3% premarket after the social media giant announced it will be laying off more than 11,000 workers. Founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said he was too optimistic about growth and now needs to streamline the company.
*****
&gt; One stock that weighed on futures was Disney, which fell more than 8% in early trading after the entertainment giant missed estimates on the top and bottom lines for its fiscal fourth quarter.

\- suptle superinflation of fiat being injected mostly into the financial ecosystem first for a whole decade prior where consumer inflation was muted  
\- enormous amounts of leverge and margin unsustainably collateralizing nonphysical assets  
\- finished with frenzied speculation, monetary tightening to bring inflation down  
\- extremely rapid shifts in the labor market over a short period of time  
\- a pandemic

**While that one took 2.5 decades to recover properly in nominal terms, referencing the dow, it is unlikely that it will take crypto that long because (Its dIffErEnt thIs tImE):**

\- the primary ecosystem is still built on technology adoption for business efficiency, crypto is a decade old, the stock market was already hundreds of years old dating back at least to the EITC  
\- most cities didnt have libraries back then, today everyone has google and gets notifications, back then in order to trade you had to be on the floor or for the highly connected trades often conducted over the phone or through snail mail, today you can trade from your phone in seconds and run bots  
\- we can see where it all is, who has what, in real time, and we can make models to predict their future behavior  
\- commodities were strong during that period as the GD marked a bottom in the commodity index that wouldnt break again until 1990; cryptos can often exhibit enough commodity like properties to create new demand layers, easing pressure on only investors  
\- stocks are usually dilutionary, with rare exceptions like berkshire leading the other way, while cryptos often have decentralized deflation mechanisms and encoded hard caps to make it easier for bulls  
\- crypto is a global market, the stock market was and still is domestic- entire governments around the world are sick of the fed and dollar hedgemony

Bitcoin,FTX' AND IT'S TOKENS? ONCE AGAIN BTC IS NOT CRYPTO!,"FTX AND ITS SHIT COINS DEBACLE WAS CALLED BY MALLARDSHEAD  6 MONTHS AGO.

Bitcoin is not ""crypto"". Bitcoin IS the breakthrough. ""Crypto"" (tokens, alts, all that) are only possible because Bitcoin showed it was possible.

Bitcoin is a network, a protocol, and a system of digital money that made one of the biggest breakthroughs in history - the invention of digital scarcity. It allowed a digital thing to be tied to the real world through quantifiable expenditure of energy (PoW). Bitcoin is a public utility that has no owners, no rulers, no backing of any state or corporation, and a conception that can never again be repeated in history.

""Cryptos"" are ""projects"" that tackle ""use cases"", raise funding, have employees,CEO'S, board members, foundations, and can easily be censored by a state. 99.99% of crypto is created to enrich the creators, with retail as exit liquidity. **All of them will trend to zero against Bitcoin**.

Bitcoin is an alternative to central banking/modern monetary policy run by volunteers and can be used by anyone and everyone. It does not discriminate. It is a public good like the internet is for moving and storing information. The Bitcoin network is for moving and storing value.

""Crypto"" is not much different from fintech companies except they use a slow and expensive database and print their own treasuries at the push of a button. Sure there might be some interesting use cases, but literally all of them can be done without a blockchain.

Understanding that Bitcoin is not crypto is just the first step. The deeper you go into that rabbit hole, the more questions you ask, the more you put Bitcoin under a microscope, the more mind-blowing it becomes.

Bitcoin is **not** ""crypto"".

I see Bitcoin, the internet, remote work, and proliferation of english (the language) composing to distribute away the power centers of nation states, banks, and corporations. Not sometime in the distant future either, rather around the end of this decade we'll see the EU alliance break, DAO's form in smaller African nations, and Palestine's imports match their exports.

It will become a real challenge for government's to levy taxes. I think we're starting to see this begin already. That means even more aggressive money printing and the militarization of tax agencies. It won't work though. Governments will have to incentivize their own citizens to pay taxes. And this will require projects of immense value with transparent accounting. The prestige politicians have enjoyed for so long will fade, as their powers get distributed to the people, and real solutions without symbolic affectation are required to govern.

When the Lightning Network is ready (nodes, liquidity, and user growth is currently parabolic), maybe by 2025, Bitcoin will enter its transaction phase. Whole coins won't be so much a thing as Satoshis or ""SATS"". The law of diminishing returns will have arrived. Gone will be the days of 1000x gains and large volatility. The gains will become smaller and slower. I expect this to begin at .01¢ SATS, which would correlate to a $1M bitcoin which would give the network the entire market cap of gold currently ($11T), still small, and we'll still see large gains until ♾/21M, but they'll be smaller and the dollar peg will fade.

A robust DeFi ecosystem will also be built on and around Bitcoin. That means smart contracts. The Taproot upgrade will kick this off in earnest which will only augment network effects and utility. Bitcoin adoption is growing at a faster global pace than the internet did in the 90s. One reason for this is because the infrastructure is already built. When ""open source"" satellites blanket the world, allowing a transaction in Patagonia or the Arctic as easily as NYC, government's can do what Elon Musk suggested they do when he was asked about regulation of Starlink over Afghanistan: ""*They can shake their fist at the sky.*""🍀

I posit Bitcoin will be man's final money, just as Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be man's final invention.

This is mostly due to the way bitcoin leverages energy, as Henry Ford and Thomas Edison crudely figured out 100 years ago in 1921. What most fail to realize is that the only physical currency in the world is energy. See, energy is required to have a standing military, to start a small business, for nation states to exist, for transportation, globalization, and maybe most importantly to communicate.

Bitcoin then, uses energy to guarantee an individual's property (BTC), and secure its network. This is much different than the approach POS consensus blockchains take. Their governance is a conversation everyone wants to side-step and pivot towards the other two parts of the blockchain trilemma they've solved. MONEY, has nothing to do with TPS, throughput, or tx cost. Those are all features of a blockchain. Many of us grew up under democracy and assume its angelic ideals are best applied everywhere. Well they're not—especially on blockchains aspiring for global adoption. The first problem is there's no way to know how many people own how many tokens, which makes the allocation of voting power impossible and unfair. Another problem is there's no way to curtail collusion. Another is that 50% of the world's population lives in two countries (China, India), and that percentage is only growing. Another is that voting is a skill. And after something is voted on and passed, token holders against the change(s) have no ability to opt-out. We won't even bother going into the tokenomics many of these projects boast.

Bitcoin does away with this nonsense by guaranteeing immutable rights, having fixed issuance, and tethering itself to the physical world by leveraging physical infrastructure, none more important than energy. Whether you have 1000 Bitcoin or 100 Satoshis doesn't matter. There's nothing one can do that the other cannot. There's no voting, no securing the network with staking, no special privileges, no collusion. And on the consensus layer, if a proposal is agreed upon by 51% of the hash, it's optional wether a miner wants to implement it or not, meaning they can opt-out.

Bitcoin's first attraction is greed, but below, it quietly disburses freedom and distributes away the center of power structures. Bitcoin pollutes the environment from an economy of scale (cheap electricity, access to capital), but below, it quietly incentivizes green energy, making it competitive regardless of fossil fuel affordability. The end result of this trojan horse is going to be fascinating to watch, and how fast it degrades nation states or finances sci-fi alternative energy projects might surprise some.

**My judgement, a warning, and if you don't mind, a tinfoil hat.**

All of this doesn't happen without manifesting very real problems during its transition phase, but whatever you're doing in life currently, it should be geared towards acquiring more bitcoin. I'd even suggest temporarily taking on a second job for the task. Now for the tinfoil hat:

As friction (technical difficulty) of wallets and hard wallets collapses, privacy and UI improvements will skyrocket. This means the first thing to break will be:

— World government's ability to levy taxes effectively, which will require an enormous increase in money printing, and the militarization of their tax collection agencies

— The second shoe to drop will be mass municipal bankruptcies, as cities are already crushed under the weight of pension debt which they carry in hopes of getting federal bailouts, because this debt is unserviceable and staring down the barrel of compound interest. With pensions gone, fireman, police, your water, teachers, parks and recreation will become unstable.

— Climate change. How will cities finance the infrastructure needed to combat worsening droughts, fires, and flooding? Much of the entire state of Florida for example (flattest US state) has serious flooding issues nobody wants to talk about. The entire lower half of the state's coastline needs projects totaling over $1T to combat sea-level rise effectively. This will all lead to migration and people on the move. Those global caravans traveling to Europe or El Norte through Mexico will number in the millions weekly.

— Healthcare, Social Security, and all social services collapse.

— The world rearranges itself rapidly, and those with the world's new reserve currency (bitcoin) remake it in their image and likeness.

Don't leave your blood on the streets. Maintain your health, keep a bicycle, buy a concealable weapon, and HODL bitcoin. You'll be fine. Good luck!

**DO NOT BE WORRIED OVER THIS BTC PRICE DROP, IT WAS ANTICIPATED AND ALL WILL BE FINE! HODL ON AND TAKE A WALK IN NATURE.**

My plan is currently in Open Enrollment for coverage for January through December. However, my wife's Open Enrollment is in May/June and her coverage period is July through the following June. Since our open enrollments and coverage periods do not align, if we make changes to our benefits during enrollment then is that a Qualifying Life Event for the other?

I particularly want to know because she started contributing to a Dependent Care FSA account, but during my current enrollment I want to contribute the federally mandated maximum of $5000 for 2023. Since I am doing that, we want to report a QLE to open her enrollment and change her DCFSA contribution to 0.

I know the simple solution is talk to her HR/Benefits Rep but her company is not so helpful with this sort of thing, so I wanted to ask here to see what is ""typical"" or otherwise mandated when spousal coverages do not align like this.

I'm considering 4 quotes while I'm waiting for 1-2 others to come in. Two are from Energy Sage and the other two I found through local references.

Notable things:

* I think the price per Watt is incorrect on some of these - or perhaps they're based on one of their loan prices, but not the financing option I'll likely select?
* These quotes cover putting 12 panels on our roof and 6 on our flat-roof garage, which is only a couple feet from the house and has adequate electrical tie-in.
* Our roof is over 10 yrs old but in good shape, so considering replacement/rehab as needed

personalfinance,Investing CDs from BoA vs Schwab,"hi Folks,

The market is extremely hard to predict this year, our investment on Stocks and ETFs show losses. We understood this is what the market and life is. We are considering to buy some CDs at this moment,  we considered Treasure Bills which fixed the return to 6.89% atm, however, it seems, the maximum is only 10k?  The website [https://www.treasurydirect.gov/](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/) seems really strange. Since we are the clients of BoA and Schwab for years, we are looking into the process of getting some CDs there from our savings.

We found, the 13 months BoA CDs' interest rate is around 2.47% vs 1 year CDs from Schwab are more or less around 4.8%. The list of the CDs from Schwab is actually from other banks, for instances there's CDs from **Synovus Bank GA 4.8% CD**, **Customers Bank PA 4.8% CD**, **Morgan Stanley Bank UT 4.7% CD**...etc., there's a long list on different period of Maturities. I'm not sure if these CDs are reliable, because some of them are issued by some less known institutions. In fact, we don't know which one we should buy, or should we just pick up the one provides the highest return? We also don't understand why BoA CD provides a much lower interests rate either.

We would love to hear your opinions. As you can feel, we are very new on CDs or any fixed income products.

personalfinance,Question about Closing a Credit Card,"This is something I’ve been wondering about for some time, but haven’t found an answer that really satisfies me. 

I am debt free, have an excellent credit score, and two credit cards. One I got in college, about 15 years ago, the other I’ve had for ten years. The college card has a high limit, terrible interest rate, and an annual fee. I never use it except for a small charge once a year or so to keep the account active. The other card I use frequently and pay off every month. It has a good interest rate, no annual fee, and offers rewards. I keep the limit low on purpose.

One thing I'm still curious about is how / if rate hikes affect both of these things.  For example, I'm seeing 17 week T-Bills at around 4.4% and have thought about laddering them (is that the right term for reinvesting at maturity?), but I'm seeing 10-12 month CDs that are closer to 5%.  If more rate hikes seem likely, would it make more sense to buy those 17 week bills in anticipation of rates increasing?  Or is there any advantage to just taking the slightly higher rate for a year and forgetting about it?  Or is it all just a total crapshoot and there's really no actual pattern / connection that exists here?

I know I'm not talking about the difference between making a fortune and massive regret, and I know either way I'll be happy that I'm earning more than in my HYSA.  I'm just curious to learn more about how all of this works.  Appreciate any insight!",finance,1668011734

Of course I thought that some of the CPI prints will be the catalyst for a dump. Folks like Jeremy Grantham suggest around 300-330 SPY being relatively fair value. There's obviously nothing stopping the market overreacting and it going a lot further down, but I thought hey 330 to begin to enter is a decent mental marker.

Anyway we've had some prints, I suspect tomorrow's will still be strong, and the Fed will go with the .5% hike on dec 2nd, and the market will sulk a bit more. Maybe continued high inflation prints into Feb and March will result in the market bottom.. maybe not. 

I'm then wondering about the VIX and will it hit the sky.. And it dawned on me today while browsing tradingview that the VIX might not spike at all. I noticed a token down 40% today .. something like 4 billion dollars in perceived wealth quietly wiped out over a couple days on one out of many many of these things. Property prices might pullback on rates, tokens will collapse, but the S&amp;P ? It's not that far from fair value. Unless something actually breaks in the economy I don't think VIX is gonna spike much.. And I'm not going to look to it. I will just wait for March 2023 to start averaging back in from my 50% cash position. Can't catch the bottom perfectly but I've sidestepped much pain.",finance,1668021091

&gt;Real-estate company Redfin Corp. laid off 13% of its staff on Wednesday and closed its home-flipping unit, saying the operation was both too expensive and too risky to continue.

&gt;The Seattle-based company, which operates a real-estate brokerage and home-listings website, said the decisions were made because it is predicting that the real-estate market is going to be smaller next year and its home-flipping business is losing money. It previously laid off 8% of its workforce in June of this year.

&gt;The closure of Redfin’s home-flipping business, RedfinNow, follows Opendoor Technologies Inc. posting record losses last week. The biggest home-flipping company sold too many homes for less than their purchase price. Opendoor blamed the pace of rising interest rates for throttling the housing market faster than the company could predict.

CryptoCurrency,Is it a Crypto Run?,"Like a Bank Run. 

I'm not as good on the mechanics and structure of crypto (vs say the traditional banking system or US dollar). 

Came by today to read up on the carnage. 

I was bluntly wrong last year when crypto just proceeded to come back higher after it dropped 50%. I think my mistake was the Fed wasn't tightening anything, $$$ was sloshing around everywhere, inflation wasn't high yet, wages were growing up strongly and the speculation hadn't run it's course (in lots of areas not just crypto).

But this feels like a Lehmanish moment. (Maybe it's Bear Stearns and we are still 6 months away from a hard flush?) People aren't in as poor of a $ state as 2007-2008, but inflation is much higher, rates are now higher, and liquidity is not that great. A key difference:

I am currently in a conundrum of whether or not to buy a new car or pay off some debt. The car that we currently have, while currently running well is a 2012 Dodge Caravan and has been nickel and diming us quite a bit in the last couple of years, especially this year. Basically, I am waiting on the shoe to drop for the next major thing to go wrong. 

Used car prices as we know are completely out of control and the difference between the trim model that we want in a brand new car vs a used car is less than $5,000.00. We currently owe $165,000 on our house and have no other debt.  We have a 3 month emergency fund saved up and plan on putting between $15,000.00 and $20,0000.00 down to get the car loan around $32,000.00 at 4 ish percent interest on a 5 year loan. Our current monthly expenses are $5,000 a month.  Our current gross income is around $170,000.00. 

I am hesitant due to the fact that that is still a large monthly payment with insurance and there is talk of a recession around the corner and my job is based on large construction so in a recession that is usually one of the first sectors that gets hit. My question to the group is would you move ahead with the purchase or would you wait for a bit to see if car prices and interest rates go down and hopefully the old car keeps going.

stocks,Amazon Becomes World’s First Public Company to Lose $1 Trillion in Market Value,"Amazon.com Inc. is the world’s first public company to lose a trillion dollars in market value as a combination of rising inflation, tightening monetary policies and disappointing earnings updates triggered a historic selloff in the stock this year. 

Shares in the e-commerce and cloud company fell 4.3% on Wednesday, pushing its market value to about $879 billion from a record close at $1.88 trillion on July 2021. Amazon and Microsoft Corp. were neck-and-neck in the race to breach the unwelcome milestone, with the Windows software maker close behind after having lost $889 billion from a November 2021 peak. 

While technology and growth stocks have been punished throughout the year, fears of a recession have further dampened sentiment in the sector. The top five US technology companies by revenue have seen nearly $4 trillion in market value evaporate this year. 
The e-commerce giant has shed $1 trillion in market value
  
The world’s largest online retailer has spent this year adjusting to a sharp slowdown in e-commerce growth as shoppers resumed pre-pandemic habits. Its shares have fallen almost 50% amid slowing sales, soaring costs and a jump in interest rates. Since the start of the year, co-founder Jeff Bezos has seen his fortune dwindle by about $83 billion to $109 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.

Last month, Amazon projected the slowest revenue growth for a holiday quarter in the company’s history as shoppers reduce their spending in the face of economic uncertainty. That sent its market value below $1 trillion for the first time since the pandemic-fueled rally in tech stocks more than two years ago.",finance,1668037702
Banking,Unexpected Check Hold Question,"I had a check mobile deposited Saturday and received and approved Monday. On Monday, I received an email saying the funds would be held for 5 days (not business days) and would be available the coming Saturday. I can't be certain, but I could have sworn the entire amount was available in online banking on Monday and then went to a hold later that day or Tuesday. It looks like they rounded the hold down to the nearest $100 and released some $10's of dollars.

If I'm looking at Reg CC correctly, at least $225 should be available the same day if there's a longer delay, and the bank is supposed to notify you of a specific reason for the delay, neither of which I got. (The hold email didn't mention the reason.)

I did call the bank, and they said it was the computer based on many different factors, that they didn't have more information, and that my check would be released tomorrow(!?) (Thursday). I also asked about the $225 not being available on the same day, and they didn't have info on that either. Surely this can't be right?

Extra info:

\-account &gt;30 days old, no overdrafts, clean history

\-under the $5525 exception limit

\-I know and trust the check writer. Doesn't write bad checks.

Things that may be going against me:

\-1st mobile check deposit, but the limit is $10k/day, $25k/month, and I'm well under both.

\-4 figure check worth more than all previous account balances combined

But neither of these excuse what appear to be 2 blatant violations of federal banking regulations. I understand the need for security, but it's frustrating to not know whether I can access my cash in a few days versus having to wait a week.

Edit: The hold seems to be released for now (Wednesday evening). (It wasn't earlier this evening.) Hopefully it stays that way. The whole thing still feels really odd though.",finance,1668038212

retirement,the 60/40 portfolio…is it dead or alive?,"Over the last several years, the 60/40 portfolio has been a fool proof strategy to achieving solid investment returns while minimizing risk. The strategy involves investing 60% in broad equity markets (domestic and international) and 40% in broad fixed income markets. Historically speaking, before this year, these asset classes had correlations close to zero and even negative, meaning the performance of each asset is independent of the other. When you combine two assets that are less than perfectly correlated with each other, risk is reduced. This is the concept behind the 60/40 portfolio, that is, smoother (less volatile) returns.

This relationship has been different in 2022 though. With inflation soaring, the Fed has been forced to rapidly increase interest rates to fight it, and has yields rising at a pace not seen since the 1980s. Bonds, which are quoted in yields, have declined in value due to the inverse relationship between bond prices and yields. We have also seen stocks decline during this same period of time which has called into question if the bond/stock neutral relationship we have observed in the past will persist into the future. A 60/40 portfolio made up of 60% ACWI (World Stock index) and 40% AGG (US Total Bond Index) has a performance of -19.88% YTD. ACWI performance is -23% YTD (not including dividends) and AGG is about -16% YTD (not including interest payments). So much for the zero correlation!

In hindsight, the 60/40 portfolio has not been a solid strategy this year. When we look forward though, there are reasons to expect bonds to perform more like bonds. US treasuries which are virtually risk-free offer a 4% yield right now and could be attractive seeing we have slowing growth and could potentially be facing lower than average equity returns for the foreseeable future.

Because I am so interested in this relationship, starting with the month of November, I will monitor the monthly performance of the 60/40 portfolio vs. the S&amp;P 500 and will post it once distribution data is available. Stay tuned…

I'm a new business owner (brick and mortar) that I just started beginning of 2022 and now realizing I bit off way more than I could chew. This is my actual adult career that I've always wanted to do and been working toward while spending years jumping random jobs (mostly service industry, no benefits, no 401k).

I've generally been good at staying on top of my finances, always maintained an above 750 credit score, and have $67,000 credit limit spanned across 5 personal credit cards -- 2 for personal expenses to collect rewards / pay in full every month, 2 that I took on for business expenses with a 15 month 0% APR, and 1 for emergency only. 

I put $30k of my savings into the biz which I thought would be enough to cover startup expenses and offer some padding until I actually started bringing in revenue, but I really should've tripled that # -- an insanely high deposit to secure the lease for my perfect office, rent, equipment and furnishing, liability insurance, inventory, marketing, staff -- it all hit me quickly and even though my doors were open since January, business didn't actually start picking up til May. To make up for that slow period with basically no money coming in I had no choice but to rack up balances on all the cards just to keep the ball rolling. Please feel free to recoil at the interest rates :)

CC1 Bal $13,000 @ 32.15% APR   
CC2 Bal $7,600 @ 28.24% APR  
CC3 Bal $10,500 @ 22.99%  
CC4 Bal $12,700 @ 16.99%  
CC5 Bal $16,500 @ 0% until 04/23, after 20.99%  
\*Total debt = $60,300  
\*Total minimum monthly payments = $1540. ( I generally try to add another $100-$200 more on top of each one but that's not even putting a dent in it at such high interest )

My credit's score's tanked this year down to 593. High utilization + in the chaos of all this I somehow missed one of my car payments and got hit w a ""30 day late payment"" that I haven't missed in my life ever.

As far as my biz goes I'm making anywhere from $5k - $8k gross revenue per month and confident that when I put more into marketing and continue to build my client base, $15k-$20k per month is totally possible within a year. The problem is I'm burning through money NOW -- money that would best be put towards marketing to bring in more biz. I can't invest in those things when everything is going towards debt. My monthly expenses are around $6k (personal &amp; biz).

I recently got off a call with someone from Credit Associates about consolidating 4 of the 5 cards amounting to $43,800 to reduce it all to one monthly payment of $653 over a 4 year period (and if I want to pay it down faster obvs I can) -- this would save me about $600 every month which would be fantastic -- the big catch is that after those debts are settled they would close my accounts and in effect tank my credit score.

I want to hold onto my highest limit CC4 as it still has a 0% APR until next April and I think I can pretty much tackle that one by then and also I don't want to be left with zero credit cards in case something happens.

I've been going back and forth about pulling the trigger on this plan -- I have not been using these cards at all and I know my income is going to significantly increase in the foreseeable future, but it's not happening fast enough and I feel like this debt is just looming over me, I need to do something. Is this the best option to go at this? I tried to apply for an OnDeck loan and didn't qualify, I haven't looked much more into balance transfers cause I've done it several times already and w my current score and utilization I don't think I'd even get approved for any new cards w 0% introductory APR.

stocks,Stock market news live updates: Stocks plummet after midterms as Wall Street turns eyes toward inflation data,"Stocks plummeted Wednesday after three days of gains, as investors mulled over a mixed verdict from the midterm election results and highly anticipated inflation data looms on the docket.

&amp;#x200B;

The S&amp;P 500 (\^GSPC) shed over 2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (\^DJI) fell by nearly 650 points, or roughly 2%. The technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite (\^IXIC) dragged down by almost 2.5%, or 260 points.

&amp;#x200B;

Investors’ optimism during stocks' three-day rally was built on expectations that Republicans would gain ground and create gridlock in Washington. But the Republican red wave failed to materialize in the U.S. midterms. Democrats managed to flip a crucial Senate seat, with John Fetterman beating Mehmet Oz in the Pennsylvania race. As of late Wednesday, both House and Senate control remains in the balance.

&amp;#x200B;

“Going back to 1951, a Democratic president with a Republican or split congress, the two most likely cases this election, has seen an average S&amp;P 500 Index return of over 17% versus an overall average of just over 12%,” Barry Gilbert, asset allocation strategist at LPL Financial, wrote in a note.

&amp;#x200B;

The final outcome of the midterm results may not be known for days or weeks, but Wall Street pros aren’t expecting a big move in markets.

&amp;#x200B;

“We expect the impact of the election to tilt the market positive, partly because we’ll have it behind us,” Gilbert added. “As far as markets are concerned, the policy impact is likely to be small, and market participants will continue to be more focused on central bank policy and inflation.”

&amp;#x200B;

To that point, investors will turn their attention to Thursday morning's inflation report, as the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for October. Economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect headline CPI at an annual rate of 7.9%, down from 8.2% the month before. Even if the report shows prices starting to moderate, core CPI remains far above the Fed’s comfort zone.

&amp;#x200B;

“We are still far above that 2% target,” Rebecca Felton, RiverFront Investment Group senior market strategist, told Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday. “So, we don't believe that the Fed is going to ease up at any point in the near term. And so rates will stay higher for longer and inflationary pressures clearly are likely to stay higher for longer, too.”

&amp;#x200B;

In corporate news on Wednesday, Meta Platforms (META) said the social media giant would cut more than 11,000 jobs, or about 13% of staff, as the company restructures to cope with the slumping digital ad market. Disney (DIS) posted weaker-than-expected fourth quarter earnings Tuesday, with the streaming business resulting in wider losses that offset strong performance at the theme parks. Disney stock shed more than 13%.

&amp;#x200B;

Elsewhere in markets, the largest U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc.'s (DHI) reported fourth-quarter earnings that showed buyers canceled nearly a third of deals, the latest red flag for the housing market. Tesla stock also fell Wednesday following a filing that showed CEO Elon Musk sold 19.5 million shares from Nov. 4-8. The sale came after he bought Twitter for $44 billion.

CryptoCurrency,I’m sorry but if you store your crypto on an an exchange you’re a cabbage.,"Some of you are new and can still be saved. 

When you store cash in a bank, you are loaning that bank money. That’s why you earn interest. 

You feel safe when you store your money in a bank because that bank is “FDIC Insured” (in the US) for balances up to $250,000. That means if your bank goes tits up, the federal government will cove you for up to $250,000. 

Want to store more than $250,000 in your savings account? STOP, punch yourself in the face and hire a financial advisor. 

This takes us to Crypto Exchanges. If you store $250,000 in crypto on the exchange and the exchange goes tits up, there is no “FDIC”. You are just fucked. 

As the exchange dies, they will liquidate everything they have to cover their debts. 

YOU ARE someone they are in debt to because you stored your crypto there, but they DO NOT GIVE A SHIT ABOUT YOU AND YOUR LOAN TO THEM. 

They will pay off debts to people rich enough to sue them. You get nothing. 

How do you protect yourself? 

Buy a goddamn ledger and store your crypto there. Blockchain is forever. Exchanges are not.",cryptocurrency,1668078885
CryptoCurrency,"In all of this Luna, Celsius, three arrows and FTX mess the SEC is still perusing Brad Garlinghouse, Chris Larsen and Ripple. The regulators do not care about investor protection.","I understand this effects ftx international but there is a huge issue with crypto in the US

The regulators do not care about the average investor. Exchanges are not federally insured.

There is no regulatory framework in the United States for crypto. Just think about that, there is NO regulation for the crypto markets in the United States. 

They have absolutely no interest in building a framework in the United States for exchanges and assets to operate in. They want it this way so they can sue and get paid. Instead of providing clear framework and policy they have lodged half baked poorly planned lawsuits. Regulation by enforcement. 

The SEC literally went after Kim Kardashian.

It’s the little guy that gets F%CKED. It’s not Do Kwon, SBF or anyone else. Frankly after this mess if people are to leave the space you cannot blame them. What happened with FTX was pure greed and there was nothing in place to stop them.

CryptoCurrency,"People who arrived here in the last few months would do well to recalibrate their sensitivity to volatility going forward, whatever happens next","I’d been saying the these last few weeks amid the dozens of articles reporting on BTC being less volatile than the stock indexes, that the people who bought in after the Luna crash are likely in for a shock if they didn’t temper their expectations. 

I can 100% imagine what it’s like with this being the your major double digit negative day after the longest slog of relative inactivity I’ve seen in on the charts since I started watching them, getting legitimately excited for a +5% day and legitimately worried after a -15% week. 

Then that nice little run in the last couple weeks is the most you’ve ever seen these things move and you almost feel like agreeing with all the people succumbing to moon boy fever and declaring the next bull run begun… and *you* got in early…

Well guess what? The market tanked, but you still got in early. And at a better time than myself or anyone else who started buying in 2020-21 did. If you started buying after BTC or ETH was -60% from ATH, whether that was a calculated decision, or pure coincidence, you’re already in at *least*  the top 20th percentile here as far as timing markets. 

All you have to do now is not lose your nerve, screw it up, and become another one of us (because we’ve almost literally all done this on at least a small scale) with a story of being invested in something that would have become an extremely good position down the line, but you either sold too early, or outright sold at a loss. The latter of which is particularly painful.

Basically, take this time, and assess why you’re in what you’re in. Even if it’s just “money go up”, why do you think money will go up? If it’s just hype, this isn’t a reason to invest in something long period. If you don’t know a fundamental reason why a thing you’re investing in will be more relevant in the future than it is now, you’re going to be extremely susceptible to panic selling if (and this is *very* likely) this dip keeps going. 

If you decide you’re in over your head and sell, no shame in that, but if you make it through this crash, you’re through the first round if eliminations. I’d just share that I felt that way myself the first time BTC dipped 20% for me. I just decided I was already too deep in it to turn back now, so I went deep  and started learning more about investing and the way these things actually work, and today although I’m not rich by a wide stretch I’m a much more informed investor for it.  

No matter how hard you dun goofed in the last week or so, if you’re still alive it’s *absolutely* possible to turn it around and (assuming they aren’t completely bonkers) make some of your aspirations for success come true in the next few years as long as you learn how to play your cards right. 

Everyone makes mistakes, but some of us pick ourselves up, take a cold hard look at our actions and how they may have contributed to what happened, and start honing our skills towards our goals, and then some of us buy BTC high, sell it low, and then become a denizen of buttcoin and call the whole asset class a scam just because you got scared.",cryptocurrency,1668083517
personalfinance,Spending habits and mortgage approval,"My husband and I are currently house hunting, and we have been pre-approved for a loan from our bank. My one concern for when we apply for the mortgage itself is how monthly spending may affect the interest rate. In general, we are both very frugal (putting aside about 50% of take home pay into savings). However, over the past couple months, spending has been a lot higher as we've booked several trips for the next year. The money used for the trips was all money intentionally set aside for that purpose, but will the fact that the recent monthly spending is so much higher hurt us? If yes, any tips on how we can minimize the impact?",finance,1668083721
personalfinance,Helping my kid build credit - used car loan?,"This might seem like a stupid idea but I'm just throwing it out there.  My kid is 19 and a sophomore at college.  We have an old POS Bronco for him to cruise around town in but he needs something a little more reliable to get to class and work, plus my daughter gets her license in a month or so and she could use the POS here around town.

So we are thinking about getting college boy a cheap used car in the $5-6k range.  Which we can just buy, that's no biggie.  But I had this thought, that maybe we have him take out the cheapest used car loan that he can get, in his name, for like 48 months.

He has no credit history so obviously we'd have to cosign for him.  That's fine.  That's the point of this exercise.

We will even make the payments but the car and loan will be in his name.  He can pay for insurance himself.

My thinking is, when the kid gets out of college, or just anytime down the road, he's going to need a decent car (or probably truck, as he's studying forestry).  He's also going to need a place to live, utilities, etc.  Rather than get walloped on that 23% interest rate on a $30k new(ish) vehicle down the road, he can get that pain out of the way on a small used car loan and then, by paying off that loan to completion, build credit history so that he actually has a credit score when he gets out of college.  Yeah, I know we'll be paying probably $15k for a $10k used car, but that beats paying $50k on a $30k car when you're just trying to get your feet under you, right?

Or am I just looking at this wrong?  Is this a dumb idea?",finance,1668083997

# [Stock futures inch higher as investors watch midterm results, await inflation data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/09/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures inched higher Thursday as investors awaited new inflation data and eyed U.S. election results.
*****
&gt; Futures connected to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 28 points, or 0.1%. S&amp;P 500 futures added 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures gained 0.2%.
*****
&gt; It follows a day of losses with the Dow dropping 646.89 points, or 1.95%. The Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 shed nearly 2.5% and about 2.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The declines came amid uncertainty stemming from U.S. midterm elections. The market had hoped Republicans would take sweeping control of the House of Representatives and the Senate on Tuesday – a situation that would create gridlock in Washington, D.C. Instead, key Senate races in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada remain tightly contested. Indeed, the Senate race between Raphael Warnock, the Democratic incumbent, and Herschel Walker will head to a December runoff.
*****
&gt; Stocks’ suffering worsened late Wednesday after crypto exchange Binance said it’s backing out of plans to acquire its rival FTX. This dragged down the tech sector and pulled bitcoin’s price to lows last seen in 2020.
*****
&gt; Lack of clarity around the election, as well as uncertainty around incoming October consumer price index data and corporate earnings reports were the drivers around the selloff, said Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer at the Independent Advisor Alliance.
*****
&gt; “Those three things are leading to uncertainty,” he said. “And, as everyone knows, markets really don’t like uncertainty.”
*****
&gt; October’s CPI report, due Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is the next focal point for investors. Economists polled by Dow Jones expect that headline CPI rose in October by 0.6% from September, or 7.9% over a year ago. It’s a key report for the Federal Reserve, which will meet again in mid-December.
*****
&gt; Weekly jobless claims are also due out on Thursday morning.

personalfinance,Best Way to Help Someone Pay of 10k CC Debt?,"Hi! So my boyfriend is about 10k in credit card debt. We live together and he's not currently working because he is studying for the Bar Exam. I have recently learned he is 10k in Chase Credit Card debt (because he couldn't really work in law school) and rather than him having to pay the minimum every month and struggle to do so with interest rates and junk, I would rather pay off his 10k myself.

Besides simply transferring him 10k and paying it off right away, is there a better way to do this? I have the 10k ready, I just wasn't sure if simply transferring the money and taking care of it in one go was the best way to go? I personally have never been in debt so this is all really new to me.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: To all those concerned, I appreciate the wariness &lt;3! I've known my bf for 7 years! He is no stranger. I have a lot in my savings, so this 10k isn't going to ruin my life if I god forbid I didn't get it back, obviously the plan is for him to pay me back when he is able to work and I do want the money back. If we were to break-up, I honestly know he would still pay me back and we discussed it. And if he didn't then I'll be the stupid looking one! I just was curious what was the best way to take care of it!",finance,1668087848

personalfinance,Purchasing Parent's home in NY,"Hey, Everyone.

Longtime lurker here, looking to purchase my first home with my wife. My parents who live in NY will be downsizing to something smaller and selling us the family home for $600,000. 


The numbers:

Savings/liquid assets: 150,000

Downpayment: 100,000-125,000

Monthly taxes: 1k(current amount), could be as high as 2k depending on tax assessment.

Income: 250,000 per year combined
10k monthly, after taxes/insurance/401k

Debt: None(yet)

Credit score: 790


While all of these sound well &amp; good. I just want to do a sanity check and make sure we're not walking into a ""house poor"" situation. Just with interest rates being as high as they are, what's considered affordable has undoubtedly shifted.


Doing some napkin math/mortgage calculators and adding in monthly costs(mortgage[7%?]/taxes/insurance/utlities) comes out to about ~5k per month range.


That will be 50% of net income on housing which I believe is within the rules of thumb I've seen. 


The house, otherwise doesn't need much if any work and it's in generally good shape. Will have it inspected before move in just to catch anything that may have been missed. 


How does that all sound? Are there any pitfalls or things I'm not thinking of?

personalfinance,"Should we renovate our fixer to sell, or just sell it as-is?","My husband and I made a mistake, buying a fixer house in Dec 2021 for $800k. We got an incredibly low interest rate and just jumped on it.

We grossly underestimated how much it would cost to renovate (it needs a new kitchen, bathroom, and roof). All in, it will probably be $100k of work. Houses in our area were going for around $900k last year, so we had originally felt like we got a deal for $800k because we could renovate and make it look exactly how we want and it could be valued at $900k after the fixes.

However, with the rise in interest rates, we have noticed home prices decline, and now more fixed up homes are selling for $850k vs $900k last year. This wouldn't really be a problem if we wanted to stay longer term in the house, however, after living here 1 year, we came to the realization this is not a long-term place for us.

We have kids, and we don't feel like we have enough space and it's not really kid-friendly enough for our kids to play outside. We want to move to the suburbs.

So what to do - should we pour $100k into renovations, and THEN sell for hopefully around $900k? Or should we just sell the house in its current state for maybe the same price we paid? In both scenarios, we are probably losing money. :(

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr - How to minimize losses when selling a fixer house. Want to move to a more suburban area.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit to add: We have slightly improved the property from when we bought it. The house has good bones, and all the fixes are cosmetic with the exception of the roof - but the kitchen/bathroom is like a time warp from 80s.",finance,1668099271
personalfinance,Bank/Financial moves to make after new higher paying job(s),"my SO and I (not married yet, 31-32 y.o.) recently are going from making 12-28k/yr each in grad school for several years to making ~90k each per year. Her base pay is 80k with a variable bonus which is probably ~8-15k, and started there in August. I just got a call yesterday, the day after an interview that I'll be getting an offer today or tomorrow for the same position she has but at a different company, so it is likely going to be very similar base pay+bonus but also +stock options. I'll know more in a couple days when I get the offer in writing and accept. Will include low premium healthcare, 6% ira/401k matching (I think 3% after that up to 15%?), etc. In a few years this is likely to increase as/if we are promoted to ~120-160k.

There are a great many things we both have to think about now, but to keep it simple I want to figure out what to do, if anything, about our banking/finances/credit cards. I have bofa for checking and savings, she has chase for both and a credit card. I have thought for a while about moving the bulk of my banking to Ally for the higher interest savings, the app, and, well, I just don't much care for bofa. I basically use the checking/debit card to pay bills and zelle transfer for the odd job I have done/buying shit on facebook marketplace. Also have an REI credit card with a not great interest rate and the perk I don't much use.

She has a weird chase account which is attached to her mom's account which was useful when she was a broke undergrad/grad student but I think it has some weird restrictions on it that crop up every so often. She also has I think a Schwab (I think?) roth IRA investment account set up/given to her by her parents with a worth of ~50k.

We both have pretty good credit scores, mine is 786, I think hers is ~770. No student loan debt. No car payments. I have 5,500 left on a debt consolidation loan I took to refinance and wipe out my credit card debt at a very low rate, like 5%. We plan to try to get married and buy a house in the next couple of years, probably in the 300-450k range. A kid or kid(s) maybe beginning ~3-4 years from now. We could very well get help with the down payment from her parents.

So I guess my question is, should we consider moving our checking/savings to Ally (or similar) for the higher interest rate savings given we will likely have more liquid cash in our accounts in the future, and while we save for a down payment on a house. I think we should roughly be expecting ~8000-9000/mo take home pay together, and roughly 3-3500 in living expenses, rent included (2100/mo, house rental). I figure I could keep the bofa account as well for a physical bank, or move that to a local credit union where we'll be living. I'd also be interested in hearing suggestions or recommendations for credit cards, as I'll transition to using one for most expenses and paying it all down every cycle. I imagine we might take flights (mostly Southwest airlines) ~6-8 times a year to visit her parents and my own, for industry conferences/short courses, and for skiing, which is her passion. And we'll probably eat out at nice-ish restaurants/bars a few times a month for networking purposes in the industry we're a part of (we're both in leadership of a local chapter of a professional society).

I'm not totally financially illiterate, I know I need to pay off what debt I have remaining, finally fix and register my car (2 years out of date, fuck you grad school), set up an emergency fund, get a handle on our monthly budget, set up max matching contributions for retirement to catch up since I have none, etc.",finance,1668099585

Is this normal?  I don't understand because in my head 12% is no where near the amount they're taking towards interest.

But there were literally so many things that its very easy to lose track of, so here is a Rewind of One Year Bear Market, get ready for the rollercoaster:

1. Complete Euphoria (Oct-Nov 2021)

The ride is going up now.  We are back in November 2021, we just got a Futures ETF approved by the SEC and had a glorious Uptober, even hitting a new ATH. But now we have been ranging at about $60k for days waiting to go into Price Discovery mode and obviously we can not forget the infamous PlanB predictions, predicting a $100k EOY Bitcoin, we all love those.

Now we just got the Inflation data in and as its going higher and BTC is a inflation hedge obviously we rise to over $65k and there seem to be no stopping until the legendary $69.420k mark. But whats this? Resistance at $69k is so big we just got rejected.

2. Denial (Dec 2021 - Feb 2021)

Now we have been in a constant downtrend for a few months and even further had made a low at $34k and the infamous PlanB predictions were shattered as we closed about 50% below them at the end of the year. But suprisingly, many still were looking for arguments that we are not a bear market yet but just a bigger than usual bull market correction. Also many were talking about the infamous fifth Wave of the Elliot Wave Pattern yet to happen.

A very high percentage of people actually still were bulls and thought that $34k is the bottom with ultimate fear. Well that did not end well…

Now we come to the time where fear was striking markets for the first time as a war was in the front between Ukraine and Russia and it did happen. BTC dived with stock markets to $34k again as many were expecting us to go way further as fear was high globally. But has Crypto ever done was people say? So instead BTC began what many thought would be the reversal with the last time we saw greed in crypto market. We had a rally to $45k and for many the bear market was once again done.

But even apart from all the prices BTC was also part of something beautiful that time, hundreds of millions of donations to Ukraine that they later even used to fund their military. That was (for me) one of the most wholesome things in crypto as crypto donations were apparently in a “hype“.

4. The End of the World, this time for real (May - July 2022)

This may be the most brutal time in crypto, ever. We jus had a fall from our long standing $34k support as we got rejected from $45k and the FED was now starting to hike rates, that mixed with a very high correlation of us to the stock markets caused a crash to $26k and then up to $30k in about a day.

That was also the period of the LUNA implosion as their so hyped-up algo stablecoin depegged and LUNA was down -50%. But still too many here thought UST would definitely peg again as if it is an unwritten rule. People bought the “dip“ on LUNA and BTC was swinging around $30k in complete fear as the support was technically already broken.

Now the Annihilation, BTC as thought could not hold up and the Do Kwon drama had been exposed now as analyst knew UST would not make it back up and it was all broken now. BTC plunges to $17k in a few days as fear has been the biggest ever with people straight up leaving. The “dead“ of crypto was certain for everyone outside of the few still standing.

5. Aftermath (July 2022 - Now)

Now its basically all been crabbing and crabbing with crypto being the most flat it has been since years. Hopes for a bear market rally come and go but the FED is keeping us down, a lot of false hopes. Just as the anniversary now approached we made another leg down in one of the most intense weeks ever in Crypto with the FTX-Binance drama unfolding and taking a ton of twists and turns, ultimately leaving crypto even more vulnerable.

Conclusion:

Now how has been the journey? Some scenarios and the overall development may be very similar to something we know:

This graph has been often memed about but I think it still showed our situation pretty well. We had Denial, we had anger and we definitively had depression. Where are we now? Who knows, but thats also not important as I think people like us who went through this one year of fear and ultimate fear and more fear, can surely survive longer.

If we have now come this far it would be silly to just turn around. Maybe we have a few months left in this bear or perhaps a few years but the right conviction and patience will get you past it just as it helped you moving until now.

personalfinance,Repayment Advice - Pay my wife's principal down or mine,"Repayment Advice - Pay my wife's principal down or mine?

Looking at best options for paying our loans off quickly once payments resume. My wife and I both work in Healthcare, we graduated in 2019 and started residency the same year. We have not made any payments toward federal student loans.
- I have 120k in federal loans and 28k in private loans
- My private student loan payment is $350 month
- My wife has ≈ 200k in federal loans
- At the start of the payment freeze we were on income driven payment plans which were both $0 per month with interest accumulating. When payments resume we will start again with the $0 due monthly with interest accumulating; my monthly interest accumulation would be $522 and I estimate my wife's would be $900 (before any loan forgiveness occurs)
-The $0 income driven repayment will end May 2024
-After taxes we bring home roughly $13,600 monthly
-Our non-student loan monthly expenses are ≈ $4,100
-In a perfect world I would like to pay $8,100 per month toward our loans

My plan is to pay off my private loans as quickly as possible and then attack our federal loan debt. My questions for the group
1) Does it make more sense to pay my wife's interest monthly and put the remainder toward my loan or vice versa?
2) My job is eligible for PSLF but I never made payments because I had just graduated when COVID started so I am not eligible for the one time 5 year forgiveness. Does anyone know if PSLF will be reduced from 10 years/120 payments to 5 years?
3) I spoke to a representative today who told me that each month of the loan pause during the pandemic will be able to be counted toward PSLF if you were working for a qualified institution during that time. I was so ostensibly I could have 40 payments credited to me already. Does this scenario change which loan I should focus on whether PSLF is shortened or not?",finance,1668105400

CryptoCurrency,I am deeply concerned about government regulation over cryptocurrency eroding its capacity for censorship resistance. Are you?,"Hello,

With all this talk about the federal government in the United States and governments abroad considering implementing various rules and regulations over cryptocurrency, I have grown increasingly concerned that cryptocurrency will gradually lose its censorship resistance. 

While I acknowledge that regulation can improve the safety of cryptocurrency as a mainstream asset class for the average investor, I am also concerned that crypto's mainstream popularity has made a target for increasing government regulation, thus eroding crypto's censorship resistance.

What is censorship resistance? **It is the ability of cryptocurrency users to make irreversible trustless transactions without needing permission from a third party.**

As crypto has grown increasingly centralized though, concentrated in the hands of a few whales and developers, its censorship resistance has been eroding. For example, take the fact that the US Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash several months ago. 

Say what you will about Tornado Cash being a haven for money laundering, it doesn't matter. There are valid and legal use cases for Tornado Cash. 

Even though validators on the Ethereum network could still process Tornado Cash's blocks, fear of the consequences of not following US sanctions have frozen those blocks from being processed on the blockchain by validators. 

Which brings us to Monero. My main fear is that Monero may be the next target for sanctions from US regulators due to its fungibility. Sanctions would effectively make it useless in the US as exchanges would stop transacting it, directing all activity underground and making it hard for the average person to get any Monero unless they mine for it or find a person to buy it from with cash. 

What do you guys think? I think cryptocurrency's mainstream adoption has become a curse. While I know the government has good intentions, these intentions can lead to bad consequences for entire ecosystems in the crypto space. The centralization of crypto is perhaps the worst development in the scene, IMO.

I missed crypto when it was underground and not mainstream.",cryptocurrency,1668106232

They are owned by Justin Sun. Here is a funny part and I could say outright this is illegal. The man just try to reduce his liabilities by f\*\*king his users once more time.

Not only the users was already f\*\*\*ed. This clown decided to f\*\*\* them once more time. Either you got something (4-5 times less than what you own) or nothing. It is like take it or leave it.

This clown just want to reduce his debt and decided to sacrifice his customers.

Who benefits in the end?

1. Sam Bankman-Fried, because he reduces his liability.
2. Justin Sun. He sends his tokens to FTX and sells them who needs to get out from FTX.

Those people are the reasons for outsiders and governments around the world to attack cryptos in general.

Well, let them all die so we could move on.

I mean, what the hell law enforcement in the US is doing? Just allow it to happen?

Let me get it straight: I have no tokens locked up on FTX nor I own any tokens associated with him and Justin Sun. But seeing this kinda action harming the crypto industry and people makes me sick.

I don't know what to advise you guys who have tokens locked up there. Maybe seek advice from your lawyers.

CryptoCurrency,FTX Liquidity Crisis of 2022: Regulation in the Cryptosphere is coming one way or another. Historic precedent demonstrates why.,"For starters, my thoughts are for those traders and account holders of FTX whose funds are frozen due to their exchange's insolvency, and the potential legal mess that would follow going forward. As always, we not only should be reminded of the phrase: ""Not your keys, not your crypto."", but take no chances by moving our assets **off** of exchanges, no matter whether that exchange you choose to park your digital assets is financially healthy today.

As the title suggests, regulation of any industry, both securities and commodities alike is not an absolute solution, but it's a necessary one. Without question, FTX's market valuation proves that it is not enough to let any financial entity self-police itself by maintaining compliance when there is little to no independent agency to oversee the entire company. Worse, any regulatory policy that isn't clear gives permission for several exchanges to determine how they should meet compliance with the market they do business in. In the case of Sam-Bankman Fried, as well as FTX, this perspective couldn't be more alarming when it comes to this nascent market.

Consider Peregrine Financial Group, a lesser-known commodities futures-trading firm that was bankrupt back exactly 10 years ago, which was ran by its now-convicted CEO: Russell Wasendorf, Sr. Unlike SBF, whom he had lobbied U.S. lawmakers to consider policy ideas for the industry (And now, he is considered to be in legal trouble with them too), Russell Wassendorf, Sr. oversaw the company during its nearly two-decade existence until 2012 -- a company that brought futures trading to individual traders through its online platform. But it went into legal trouble over confirmed allegations that his firm mishandled client funds, which brought attention to CFTC and the FBI, and ultimately resulted in both the company's insolvency and his overall demise in [federal prison](https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndia/pr/peregrine-financial-group-ceo-sentenced-50-years-fraud-embezzlement-and-lying).

At this point, the situation is certainly escalating to how FTX will meet its fate at the end of the day. However, any regulatory effort shouldn't be ignored on the fact that without a sound regulatory framework in various parts of the global economy when it comes to crypto exchanges, the crypto market, as we know it today, will not gain its own legitimacy for years to come.",cryptocurrency,1668120821

I [33M] am currently a renter. I did own a home but I sold it last year. I no longer lived in the area, had no interest in being a landlord, and it had doubled in value since I had bought it.

I see interest rates rising. If home values drop enough or if I see something I really like, I may decide to buy instead of renting.

I know that many people who buy homes in a high-interest environment get a mortgage, pay a premium while they wait for rates to drop, and then refinance.

My question is, can you buy all-cash, wait for rates to come down, and then get a mortgage? Does it ever make sense to do this? Are the interest rates different when you put a mortgage on a home later vs when you buy it?

The other thing that's hard to predict assuming this approach is possible is if it's financially beneficial. If I sink $500k into a home while I wait for mortgage rates to come down, how much could I have made in the meantime by parking that money in index funds? How much would I save my not having a mortgage while the rates are high?

personalfinance,8 Month Journey Leaves Stealership In The Red,"TLDR: Got a written contract for a 2023 Elantra Preferred from a stealership, who gave me a “loaner” for 8 months because they were dumb. They couldn’t deliver on their agreement because they were fraudulent, but I had everything in writing. Leveraged into a massive deal saving me thousands of dollars, using a car for free for half a year, and costing the dealership a hefty sum. Got my car for \~20k out the door instead of 35k (mandatory MSRP hikes and addons for new cars), and a reduced interest rate. - [Outline of the Deal - Pic](https://i.ibb.co/rwWYTCX/car-dea.jpg)  


(Alberta, Canada – names of parties left out) This is a car buying story for the ages, where I used every skill I had at my disposal to get more than I ever bargained for and cost a dealership a lot of cash in the process.  


Cue March 2023. I am in the market for a new vehicle as my old beater 2007 Crown Vic was starting to feel a little unsafe, and fuel prices suck. I scour the market for new and used options, due to the used market inflation I really didn’t see a lot of value in buying used. I also had the benefit of not being in a rush as I had a working vehicle, so I settled on doing a factory order. Looked around and settled on the Hyundai Elantra Preferred (SEL) trim as I really enjoyed its mix of styling, value, and features.  


Went to a local dealership and struck a deal, and put a deposit on a 2023 model. At the time they had not started production but I was near the start of the waitlist for new models to be shipped in summer 2023. I was happy with how the negotiation went, basically agreed to MSRP + doc fee and was paying for a couple of individual add ons (mats, block heater, mud flaps) without markup. Since I was patient for a 2023 I didn’t need to fight over MSRP markups and mandatory add ons for in stock vehicles.  


Now here I was with a deposit on a new vehicle, but I still wanted to play the field a bit knowing that I could withdraw my deposit at any time. I connected with another dealership, but this one was more of a broker service. They don’t carry their own inventory but work within the inventory of the greater corporate entity to facilitate sales (they own a lot of dealerships across the country), so basically the lot with the car splits a commission with the broker.  


As I have significant leverage (deal in hand) I get the broker to work for me a bit if he wants to earn my business. This guy says he is new at this dealership and appears hungry for a sale. After some back and forth, our broker friend proposes that he give me a “loaner” from April until the delivery for the 2023 Elantra at “no cost”. This would mean I could flip my Crown Vic and drive something else for a while in the meantime, I like this idea but the deal sounded fishy as there was negative incentive for a dealer to strike such a deal. So he promised me a lot but that I had to “buy” the first car, and then “trade it back” when I get the 2023 at no cost. Alarm bells rang and I could smell the grift coming, but I also smelled opportunity…  


My counter was to ensure that I had everything agreed upon in a written contract that I drafted (that included everything verbally agreed upon), and both parties signed at the purchase of the loaner vehicle. I got a  2016 Cruze to drive around in, it was a nice upgrade from the Crown Vic. The signed agreement was almost 2 pages long and included the agreed upon “all-in” price of the 2023 Elantra preferred for 26306 CAD (MSRP of the 2022 with a doc fee, locked in) with a locked in 3.99% interest rate @ 84mo (promotional as of March 2023). I bought the loaner, and sold back @ remaining cost of loan plus cash back equal to all my payments. Dealer responsible for all maintenance or mechanical issues. If there was a theft or collision, I dealt with my insurance and provided options for the dealer on the vehicle, but they needed to make me whole. And I had a buyback clause I could trigger for the dealer to take back the loaner by Sept 2023 if they had not delivered yet and I needed out. Honestly, it was crazy what they agreed to but… I figured I had everything in writing so it will work out in the end. Broker signed as did his sales manager, golden. I went back to my local dealer and withdrew my deposit. Sold my Crown Vic for a nicely inflated amount due to market conditions.  


Now August 2023, I had been in occasional contact with my broker over the summer for updates but had nothing. I noticed I started seeing 2023 Elantra’s available for purchase on the market so I was eager to connect and figure out what the plan for delivery was. Over 3 weeks I attempted phone calls, text, voicemails, and emails to the broker but had radio silence. I was patient and documented all my attempts in google docs to cover my ass. After a while of nothing, I started escalating. Called the broker’s boss who said they would get back to me, nothing. Next I sent an email to the broker’s dealership main email address, they said they would get back to me and I got nothing.  


Next step…. I looked up the dealership’s corporate entity and found a general email address. I wrote up that I was trying to sort out my agreed upon deal and had tried to contact them (insert all the dates and times) but hadn’t heard back and I needed assistance with resolving my issue. Got a call from the VP of Finance for the whole shebang who seemed perplexed by my explanation of events and what was agreed upon. Said he would look into it and get back to me, I sent him my written and signed agreement for review.  


Got a callback, Mr. VP was rather appalled by what his employees agreed to and had no clue why they made the agreement they did with me. Apparently those individuals are now no longer employed there (who knows if that is true), but Mr. VP is going to fix things for me. He confirmed that as the agreement was written that the broker had no ability to actually follow through with the factory order of the 2023 as written, and generally couldn’t honor locked-in rates and costs like they did, or offer a loaner like they did. But as it was all written he agreed I was entitled to get what was agreed upon and he would compensate me an additional $2500 for my trouble towards the car.  


It took a little while and some more back and forth to figure out how I would get delivery on the 2023 Elantra, but eventually got mine this week and traded back the 2016 loaner. Because of the way the broker’s dealership works with the regular dealerships, they basically had to swallow a pill to get me the car as the dealership is not obliged to take a loss. So the “all-in” price for the Elantra today would have been around $35000 CAD due to MSRP markup, mandatory addons/fees… Plus interest rates went up so the broker needed to buy back interest rate points from the bank to meet the 3.99% costing them even more. With my cashback from payments on the 2016, plus the 2500 I got as down payment I walked out the door with the 2023 Elantra Preferred with a loan for $20k at a reduced interest rate vs. what is available today. And I drove a free car for 8 months putting 10000km+ on it for wear/tear. I put  0 down, the 5500 is from the payments from the Cruze and 2500 compensation.  


The cherry on top was that I got my addons for free, and a color swap to brilliant blue from white ($500 cost) for free as well! Further they sold me the 2016 Cruze at an inflated cost and interest rate, so the deal on the trade in is crazy to look at! Oh... And I never left my house, all deals were done over the phone and electronically as the place I was negotiating with was over an hour away (cars delivered to my doorstep!)  


Throughout this whole process I kept the options of bringing the matter forward to AMVIC (licensing body for dealerships) as leverage in my back pocket, as well as options to go to the media, and then eventually civil court should things not work out. But since I got what I wanted, I opted to keep it internal as if I had to escalate it would have made things more messy and I doubt I would have had much of a better outcome anyway for my time.",finance,1668132355
investing,ETFs that have worked during 2022,"I own a bunch of underperforming ETFs which I love and believe in. But the two I love and believe in that have outperformed during 2022 are BIZD and IFRA, with an honorable mention for HYMB.

BIZD is a business development company ETF. Very niche investment consisting of middle market lenders/equity owners. BIZD has a very high yield — 10%+ at the moment — and there is default risk in the event of recession. If those scenarios are avoided the yield pays you nicely to wait. Some BDCs can be good in a rising rate environment if the underlying loans are floating rate and the borrowers can handle the increased debt service. BIZD is down 8% on the year, nice outperformance versus major indexes. I expect the ETF to trail in raging bull markets and to sell off hard in a recession, but to generate high single-digit annual returns over time.

IFRA is the iShares infrastructure ETF. Infrastructure stocks are a steady eddy investment which tend to experience shallower drops in difficult periods. Their revenues tend to hold up because they largely derive from the public sector. IFRA is down a little under 7% YTD. This one will also trail during bull markets but I expect it to hold up nicely in the event of recession. 

HYMB is a bit of a stretch to include here because it is down 20% on the year, but I expect it to turn in a nice performance once interest rates stabilize and risk appetites return. This ETF holds high yield muni bonds — think Puerto Rico, heavily indebted parts of California and Illinois, any public debt issuer that needs to pay a premium to borrow. The reason I like this one so much is the high yield with tax advantages. Its 5% yield right now is about the same as 8% from a taxable corporate bond fund. Nice long-term hold in my taxable accounts. It might sound risky in theory to hold debt from struggling/heavily indebted municipalities but the implicit backing of states and low likelihood that more than a few default simultaneously makes this one very attractive.

personalfinance,Should I trade down on my vehicle even though it has $5k negative equity?,"I'm trying to cut down on all of my debts. I'm driving a 2021 Nissan Sentra SR premium package, trade in value is about $20k. My balance on the car is about $25k. I considered getting a car under $10k, example an $8500 2010 corolla. Hypothetically I could get the corolla, finance it and be left with a new balance of $15k (rolling in the negative equity from the sentra). Would it be worth rolling in the negative equity into a beater just to cut down on roughly $10k debt and be left with a lesser vehicle with $8-10k negative equity? or should I just tough it out and take the negative equity on the sentra to the chin and pay off this car as is. I do LOVE the sentra, I gush at it everytime I see it lol  My intention is to pay off the Sentra by the end of 2023 to avoid additional interests since my interest rate is pretty high, 9.75%.",finance,1668134353
CryptoCurrency,Shower thoughts: The entities FTX is asking for a bailout have the most to lose if FTX falls,"OKX, Kraken, Tether. Watch out.

These companies might have a lot to lose if FTX falls. FTX knows this. So SBF is saying, either we go down together or you give us money to bail us out.

It's the same deal with Voyager. We found out that Voyager, FTX, and Alameda were interconnected and that Voyager going down was going to hurt SBF's empire. So he tried to bail them out.

The crazy thing is, suppose these entities agreed to bail FTX out together. They don't go down together right now. But let's suppose that crypto falls a bit more. Then they're all f'ed together. Just kicking the can down the road.",cryptocurrency,1668134565
personalfinance,I think our withholdings are messed up,"I noticed today while depositing a paycheck from my husband's job that his federal withholding was zero for this pay period, $490 for the year. This isn't normal for me to have a paper paycheck in my hand to deposit, but I'm glad that it happened because now I'm freaking out. I looked at mine, and it's somehow worse. Zero for the pay period, and zero for YTD. I'm the one who handles all of this stuff just because it's easier.

We got married in Jan 2021, and I changed my filing status soon after. My husband didn't get around to changing his until this March. His is MFJ 0. 

 In the payroll app that my company uses I just tap what applies: 
1. Married filing jointly
2. We both work
3. I claim our son, he'll be five in two weeks
4. No idea what adjustments I'd need so they're all zero (other income, deductions, extra withholdings)

I make about $31.1k per year, he makes about $28.4k per year. 

My state and local tax situation is square, so I'm not worrying about that. I'm aware that you want to have no refund, and I'm cool with that but I also don't want to pay them the estimated $900-1200 the IRS Withholding Calculator is saying I'll have to. 

So my questions are: where did I fuck up? How do I fix this now so I don't start 2023 in a mess? Or am I being silly? I do have paranoia surrounding money issues stemming from a lot of instability and periodic homelessness throughout life... So please don't belittle me. More info available if needed. 

Edit 1: He brings home about $850 every two weeks and I bring home around $1000.

personalfinance,Did I calculate my 2023 federal income tax liability correctly?,"The IRS calculator is still set for 2022, so I am asking here. I started my first job out of college this summer with an annual gross income of $62,000 ($5166.67/month, one paycheck/month). 

I will be eligible for a 403b account after one year of employment on August 2023, where I can contribute 5% ($258.33); and my employer will contribute 8% for a total of 13% of my pay onto the account per month. 

From August 2023 to December 2023 (5 months), my total 403b contributions will be $258.33 * 5 = $1291.65. Additionally, I will pay $14.48/month towards vision insurance—$173.76 for the entire year. Thus, my taxable income in 2023 will be $62,000 - pretax deductions ($173.76 + $1291.65) - standard deduction ($13,850) = $46,684.59.

According to the 2023 tax table, my federal income tax liability will be $5,578.10 ($5,147 + 22% of the amount over $44,725). If I want close to a zero refund, I should set up my W4 in 2023 such that $5,578.10 / 12 = $464.84 is deducted in federal withholding per month. Are my calculations correct?",finance,1668141469

51. Everyone who saw the “Day in the Life of a Meta PM” video comes away shocked at the -20% dive after the earnings report.

94. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

solar,How covered/futureproofed am I?,"So, my system is getting installed as we speak, it is a 10.4 kw system consisting of 26 RECAAA Pure panels with two Tesla Powerwalls. 

I have a 2200 sq foot, two story house with central AC. I live in what might be the hottest part of the Bay Area during the summertime. During peak energy usage this September, we used around 1500 kWh in a month, and that was with the AC set to 78. 

I am not a math genius and I struggle with the DC/AC power conversions. I went solar because I was tired of paying 500+ electricity bills to PGE monthly, and I want to be protected from rolling blackouts hence the powerwalls. The system ideally would cover our whole usage, but if we end up having to pull a little from the grid, so be it.

Do you all think this system will generate enough energy to cover our actual usage? (We just moved here earlier this year, so my estimation is that if you were to average our monthly usages out, it would add up to around 1200 kWh monthly?)

We want to eventually move to EVs so EV charging will add to our usage quite substantially down the road",energy,1668151731

vet,Having issues with severe allergies with cat,"First off, I am estranged with my family other than my brother who I let live with me and my husband.  Recently my younger sister died at the age of 37 from cancer.  She lived in a small apartment with a roommate and she had a older cat with extreme allergies.  The only other people really in our family is my cousin and my father.  My cousin or the roommate was not in a position to take the cat.   If my father took the cat he would have dropped him off at a shelter.  So I decided to take her cat, it is the only thing she cared about in the world.  To the point that when her roommate was going through her personal belongings after she died he found a short note hidden addressed to him.  She apologized for the things she did and asked him to please take care of her cat.  It was her last and only request in the world, so I at least want to try to honor that since no one else can or would.

He is a large black medium haired cat around 12 years old.

The info I got from him was that the first five years he had no issues but five years ago all these allergy issues popped up.  They thought it was because the only thing they fed him was friskies can chicken and cheese food and thought that did it to him.  Their thought process was that he is allergic to chicken triggered from eating it too much.  She tried all kinds of different expensive foods trying to find something that kept his allergies down.  IDK that chicken is the issue since when I got him his entire neck was scabbed over with a bad scab on the top of his head.  So not feeding him chicken did not seem to work.

He was an only cat all his life but we have three cats so he had a hard time at first but everyone is gotten used to the situation but still he keeps to himself and part of the issue is his allergies due to a hissing noise he makes.   His feet seem to be a big issue.  He will take a step, start hissing and bite his feet.  At times he looks like a dragon, he is a pretty big cat.  He will walk and move his head back and forth hissing as he walks because he is bothered by them.  Something that the roommate told me that he did.

When I first got him I took him to a vet.  They gave him steroids and a antibiotic.  I was really hoping his allergies were all environmental since they did not live in the nicest of apartments in atlanta.  He said that at one point they had a issue with a water pipe leaking in their carpet and it took them a very long time to get the apartment complex to fix the issue.  The cat did get better after that first treatment.  All the scabs got better except for one scab about an inch big on his neck.   His watery eyes cleared up and did much better.

Then my husband wanted to sit in the backyard with him for a little bit.  We normally do not let our cats go outside at all.  But he thought with supervision and the fact he lost his patio he sat on on the second floor of the apartment,  he wanted to give him a good experience outside.  After that he had an extreme flair up.  We took him back to the vet, got another round of steroid shots and antibiotics and again he started to get better.  This time they also gave me a prescription allergy medicine for cats.

He really really hated the medicine.  I think he got really mad at us for it.  Before that he was laying in our bed but after we started the medicine he started sleeping in a place away from everyone and avoided us.  IDK if he really got much out of the medicine.  He would refuse to swallow the liquid once we got it in his mouth.   He would just stand there after we put it in his mouth and let drool run out of his mouth.  I had no idea cats could drool so much.   We did the 10 day treatment of it like it said.  I have since talked to the vet and she said I could still give it to him every 2 or 3 days.  But it is causing him to hate us and go into hiding and again IDK how much he is really getting into him.

Now the scabs are slowly coming back and he has little hair on the sides of his body.

The vet said there is no good allergy medicine for cats like there is for dogs.  So now IDK what to do.  His life is miserable, he can not walk without being in pain.  He is always scratching himself, large clumps of hair will just fly off him.  IDK if this is what happened with my sister, if she went through all of this  with vets and nothing helped and just gave up and just accepted that this was his life.

If anyone has any suggestions I would appreciate it, I would really like him to have a more comfortable life.",cryptocurrency,1668194752

personalfinance,Paying off my grandma’s mortgage “early”?,"Well, my grandma unfortunately passed away in August. She was my best friend, raised me and became like a sister as I got older and she needed to be taken care of. We were truly two peas in a pod.

She left behind the house I grew up in. Bought it in 1992. So it’s 30 years old. 

My dad is her only child but he struggles a lot financially. He filed bankruptcy about 9 years ago and he has always been the one paying the mortgage (about 27 years because my grandma became ill 3 years after buying this house) 

He is an independent contractor and works pretty hard. 

I inquired with Wells Fargo and the pricinple balance is 13k, the total balance is about $16,300.

Is it a bad idea to pay off this house? He pays around 2000 a month, take a hundred or two off. He claims the interest rate had been raised.


Ultimately, I feel like doing this would help him save money monthly and be one less stressor. Is this for what ever reason a bad idea financially or in terms of credit? For the record, I am not rich, just want it gone and I feel like I can do it based on the money I make on a project that is around $14000. I’ll take the remainder out of my savings. (15000).

Is this a bad decision? Basically asking because I keep reading that paying off a balance is not good (while I think it’s a great thing).",finance,1668202711
CryptoCurrency,FTX and SBF have openly shown that they’ve been contradicting themselves since the start (an exploration of their ToS),"So if you head over to [ftx.us](https://ftx.us) and tap on the site banner you’ll notice the banner says: “FTX’s crypto regulation policy blog”

And the first post is “Possible Digital Asset Industry Standards” posted less than a month ago.

In this post he says “This document contains a draft of a set of standards that we as an industry could enact to create clarity and protect customers while waiting for full federal regulatory regimes.  “

They also note that it is written by SBF.

They talk about:

1. Hacks and Accountability
2. Asset listing; also, what is a security?
3. Tokenized equities
4. Customer Protections, Disclosures, and Suitability
5. Sanctions, allowlists, and blocklists
6. DeFi
7. Stablecoins

Section 4 applies to what’s been going on recently. In his post he says:

“Investors should be given clear, comprehensible information describing the asset they are considering, and regulators should crack down on any that misrepresent or make materially misleading marketing claims.

I also think that, as a default, systems should not meaningfully run on credit–especially for retail.  Retail investors should generally not be able to lose more than they have deposited to a platform, and any credit extended by a platform should be given extreme scrutiny if its failure could result in socializing losses among other innocent investors on the platform.  This is one of the core planks of the clearing model we propose in our DCO amendment.”

Sounds good, right? 

Well, I had a look at both ftx.com and ftx.us terms of service:

ftx.com’s terms state:

“8.2.6 All Digital Assets are held in your Account on the following basis:

(A) Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. FTX Trading shall have no liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Assets held in your Account.

(B) None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User’s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.

(C) You control the Digital Assets held in your Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the Terms), you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.”

So we definitely have a breach of terms for ftx.com customers.

But

ftx.us says NOTHING about this at all. 

So if you’re a ftx.us customer, and they’re still processing your withdrawals, for your own sake withdraw your funds now, don’t tell yourself you’ll do it later, they’ve already declared bankruptcy.",cryptocurrency,1668203028
oil,Oil price forecast?,"Hi guys,

Keen to get everyones opinion. Have an interview coming up and it would be great to get a few different opinions and compare :)

My current view, I think there are numerous forces at play at the moment which are affecting oil prices and I feel like we are in some sort of limbo where we are waiting to see a clear direction from which the price can then follow.

**Bullish:** 

The most recent data was the CPI report, came in lower than expected, thats good for sentiment of higher oil prices. Potentially indicates inflation has peaked, meaning interest rate hikes will be less aggressive and not remain at these levels for as long as previously thought ... so perhaps a shorter recession, thus less decreased demand, so bullish for oil prices.

Dollar is weakening again due to CPI report and hopes of lower interest rate hikes .. bullish for oil prices. 

China easing COVID restrictions .. hopes for increased imports / economic activity and demand of oil.

The G7 embargo on Russia oil coming in (supposedly) on 05-Dec ... supply down .. price up.

If the price cap goes ahead, i think itll completely backfire, Russia doesnt care about the price cap, they will just shut everything off for Europe, they can still sell about 80% *(read one report on this figure)* around this price cap.

Ongoing OPEC + cuts

**Bearish:**

Unemployment starting to rise, some of the big banks announcing redundancies .. META's 11k firing plan .. indicative of decreased demand

Increased US inventories in first week of November, indicative of potentially slowing US demand

US oil refineries supposedly will be running at full capacity for the rest of the year? Not sure how true this is.

Kuwait's Al-Zour refinery has finally started commerical operations

EIA cut 2023 energy demand and production outlook by 21% lower than expected .. due to aging wells and supply chain bottlenecks .. feel like this could be one for bullish as well.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, think short-mid term price has more upside momentum. However with the view that inflation gets under control in the mid-long term, I would expect these inflated prices now to come back down to their long term averages.

*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 closed out its best week since June as a report on Thursday showing slowing inflation raised hopes that the Federal Reserve would soon slow its tightening campaign.
*****
&gt; The broader market index added 0.9%, to close at 3,992.93. This brought its gain for the week to 5.9%, its best week since the one ended June 24 of this year. The Nasdaq Composite added about 1.9% to end at 11,323.33 as investors snapped up tech shares on hopes interest rates would ease. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.1%, closing at 33,747.86.
*****
&gt; Tech stocks on Friday shook off a decline in cryptocurrencies. Virtual currencies tumbled sharply this week and once again came under pressure Friday after FTX filed for bankruptcy protection, and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried resigned. Bitcoin and ether both declined.
*****
&gt; Still, tech stocks and related crypto stocks rebounded after opening lower Friday. The tech sector in the S&amp;P 500 surged 10% through Friday, its best weekly performance since April 2020. Amazon was up more than 4% on Friday, while Google-parent Alphabet was 2.6% higher.
*****
&gt; The Dow jumped more than 1,200 points on Thursday following a smaller-than-expected rise in consumer prices for the month of October, giving investors hope that inflation may be cooling. The S&amp;P rose 5.5%, and the Nasdaq Composite surged about 7.4%. It was the best day since 2020 for all three indexes.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields plunged Thursday on the back of the weaker-than-expected inflation print. The bond market was closed on Friday to observe Veterans Day.
*****
&gt; “From an equity market perspective, as long as the threat of much higher rates is out the way, this should remove a major headwind,” Barclays’ head of European equity strategy Emmanuel Cau wrote in a Friday note.
*****
&gt; All of the indexes posted a winning week. The Dow was up 4.1% on a weekly basis, while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 8.1%. The week marked a resumption of a comeback rally for the bear market, which began in mid-October.

&gt; # Banks and Brokers on Fire

&gt; The Financial sector ETF (XLF) has been on fire since its intraday low of $29.59 on October 13th, which was the day of the hotter than expected September CPI report. From that low point on 10/13, XLF is up 20.2%. As shown below, the ETF is currently at the very top end of a wide sideways range that has been in place over the last six months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/xlfchartuse.png))**

&gt; Below is a sampling of some of the most well-known banks and brokers that are part of the Financial sector. As shown, names like Goldman Sachs (GS), JP Morgan (JPM), Jefferies (JEF), Raymond James (RJF), and Stifel (SF) are all more than 10% above their 50-DMAs, and the only stock that's not overbought (&gt;2 standard deviations above 50-DMA) is LPL Financial (LPLA), which traded lower on earnings yesterday.

&gt; A quick look at the six-month price charts of the stocks listed in the table above gives you a glimpse into the huge rally that this area of the market has experienced since early October. Investors have seemingly been loading up on them with short-term Treasury yields now significantly higher than the interest rates these banks and brokers are paying customers on deposits.

&gt; # Homebuilders Extended

&gt; Every day we browse through our Trend Analyzer tool (available with a Premium or Institutional membership) to monitor trends and overbought/oversold levels across financial markets. When we got to the homebuilder stocks this morning, we had to do a double-take after seeing some of the recent moves in this space. Have a look at the moves in the snapshot below. Most homebuilder stocks have rallied 12-15% over the last five trading days, leaving them in extreme overbought territory, which means they're more than two standard deviations above their 50-day moving averages. DR Horton (DHI), Lennar (LEN), NVR (NVR), and PulteGroup (PHM) are the most extended. Even after the rally in these names over the last week, we'd note that they're still all down sharply year-to-date as the spike in mortgage rates from 3% up to 7%+ has caused activity in the space to slow to a crawl. A drop in those mortgage rates over the last few days was the catalyst for the recent move higher in share prices. If you're wondering which way the homebuilders are likely to trade going forward, keep an eye on interest rates -- that's the entire story these days.

&gt; # A Very Encouraging Inflation Report, Including Goods Deflation (Finally)

&gt; One month does not make a trend, but today’s consumer price index (CPI) report was very positive. Dare I say, it’s probably the best inflation report we’ve seen in about 15 months, especially because there were so many encouraging signs in it. This is a huge relief, and markets appear to be responding in kind. S&amp;P 500 futures were up more than 3% after the CPI report was released and as of lunchtime, the rally continued.

&gt; Let’s walk through it.

&gt; Headline inflation rose 0.4% in October, as expected. Core inflation, which strips out volatile food/energy prices, and is arguably more important for the Federal Reserve (Fed), surprised: rising 0.3% in October, below expectations for a 0.5% jump. This is the lowest monthly increase since September 2021.

&gt; Looking back over the past year, headline inflation is up 7.8%. That’s high but that’s come down from 9.1% in June. A big part of the deceleration was falling energy prices – you can see how the lighter red bars have been making up a smaller portion of inflation over the past few months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-headline-inflation-decelerating-578x800.png))**

&gt; In the chart above, you can see that Food prices continue to make a big piece of inflation (dark red bars). But we got a break here as well. “Food at Home”, i.e. groceries (which make up close to 9% of the inflation basket), rose just 0.4% in October – the lowest in more than a year and well below the average 0.7% monthly increase we’ve seen over the first 9 months of the year.

&gt; # The Goods Deflation We’ve Been Waiting For
&gt; We’ve been talking about how private inflation data has been showing decelerating prices for goods outside energy and food. Just yesterday my colleague Ryan Detrick wrote about collapsing used car prices. Retailers have been telling us for a while that they’re discounting items as well. We’ve just been waiting for the official inflation data to catch up, and looks like it’s doing that, finally.

&gt; There’s a broad list of goods, including used cars, that saw prices fall in October, which is what makes it even more encouraging. The items below make up about 11% of the inflation basket (and 14% of the core basket). Falling household goods prices probably reflect the slowdown in residential activity, as home sales collapse amid higher mortgage rates.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-table-goods-prices.png))**

&gt; # Are Rents Breaking?
&gt; The best part about goods deflation is that it offsets high services inflation. As you can see below, the blue bars are now below the zero line for the second month in a row. We also got good news in the form of medical care services – which was a function of falling health insurance premiums.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-core-inflation-576x800.png))**

&gt; The biggest part of the inflation basket is Shelter, including rents on primary residences and something called “Owners’ Equivalent Rent” (OER), which is the “implied rent” that owner-occupants would have to pay if they were renting their homes. The latter is also determined using rents of equivalent homes as I wrote about a month ago. In other words, OER is effectively a measure of rents, and altogether rents make up a whopping 40% of the core inflation basket.

&gt; And rents have been rising, putting a lot of upward pressure on core inflation. You can see the gray bars in the previous chart growing larger and larger over the past year.

&gt; However, market rents have been decelerating quite rapidly over the last few months – Ryan discussed this just yesterday. The problem is it hasn’t shown up in the official inflation data because of methodological reasons (we wrote about this quite extensively).

&gt; But the official rental data may be beginning to turn. Rent of primary residence rose 0.7% month-over-month and OER rose 0.6% in October, which is lower than what we’ve seen over the previous couple of months. Make no mistake, a 0.7% rise is still a lot – that translates to an annualized pace of 9%, which is why the Fed is really worried about it. But hopefully, the October data is a sign that the official data is beginning to turn and follow the private data, lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-10-picture-rents-private-vs-offical-599x800.png))**

&gt; # What does this mean for Fed policy
&gt; Perhaps the most important question.

&gt; As I said at the top, one month is not a trend. But this is not random. It jives with all the other leading indicators of prices, which have been showing a deceleration in prices. And now it looks like the official data is catching up.

&gt; With respect to policy, Fed officials are unlikely to change their minds based on one report. They’ll probably need to see at least three of these before starting to view it as “convincing evidence” that inflation is on its way down.

&gt; But what today’s CPI does is that it buys time. Yet another hot inflation print would have put more pressure on the Fed to raise rates even further. By coming out on the soft side, the report increases the odds for a “soft landing” scenario. In other words, inflation and wage growth can (hopefully) come down without the Fed having to ratchet rates higher and higher, which would eventually break the labor market.

&gt; # Haves and Have Nots

&gt; As evident in our Sector Snapshots over the past several days and as we discussed yesterday on Twitter, sector performance has lately been a tale of the haves and have-nots. The areas of the market that possess some of the most heavily weighted stocks, namely Communication Services, Consumer Discretionary, and Technology, have drastically underperformed other cyclical sectors like Financials, Industrials, and Materials. As a result, relative strength lines have blown out. Shown another way, in the charts below, we show the ratios of each of these sectors relative to the S&amp;P 500. A rising line would indicate the sector is outperforming the broader market and vice versa.

&gt; Communication Services has been in a brutal downtrend in relative strength terms for more than a year now and the recent drop has been steep. While the ratio of Consumer Discretionary to the S&amp;P 500 has been more range bound in recent years, there have been a few wild swings in the past year. The most recent swing lower is leaving it close to the lowest levels since early 2015. Tech's decline has not been nearly as sharp, but the ratio here has nonetheless rolled over to some of the lowest levels of the past few years. Conversely, Financials, Industrials, and Materials have all seen their ratios rip higher to the upper end of the past few years' range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110922-Ratiosa.png))**

&gt; In measuring just how sharp of moves these ratios have experienced, they have been outright historic. As for the most pronounced moves, the drops in the lines of Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary rank in the bottom percentile of all 10-day moves since 1990 when our sector data begins. The only periods in which the ratios fell by similar degrees, if not by more, were during the Dot Com bubble. While Tech's ratio is at new multi-yea rlows, its decline was large (ranking in the 17th percentile) but not nearly as sharp, standing out much less than the aforementioned sectors.

&gt; Like Tech, the moves in Financials and Materials have also been quite large and rank in the top decile of all 10-day moves, but those are far from records. The outperformance of Industrials on the other hand, has been remarkable. As of yesterday's close, the ratio versus the S&amp;P 500 rose 7.24% over the past two weeks. Only three other days—May 19 through May 21, 2020—since 1990 have seen higher readings.

&gt; # Small Business Labor and Inflation Slumping

&gt; The NFIB released its October data on small business optimism this morning. The headline index was expected to show further deterioration in optimism, and exactly that occurred as the index fell to 91.3 from last month's reading of 92.1 versus expectations of 91.4. This month's reading is off of the spring lows which had surpassed the worst levels from the early stages of the pandemic but remains one of the weakest readings of the past several years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-1.png))**

&gt; In the table below, we provide a breakdown of each category of the report. The headline index is now just off the bottom decile of readings as most components are likewise historically depressed. While the report was weak, there were some exceptions with strong showings in labor market metrics like Plans to Increase Employment, Job Openings Hard to Fill, and Compensation.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-Table.png))**

&gt; Even though these labor market metrics have remained at very high levels from a historical perspective, they have largely been rolling over for the better portion of the past year. Hiring plans as well as the percentage of firms reporting cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues are back to similar levels as the year prior to the pandemic. Meanwhile, actual employment changes are negative (as they have been throughout the pandemic) implying businesses are reporting a net decline in workers. That is in spite of still elevated compensation and a sharp spike higher in compensation plans. In fact, that index is just shy of the peak from the final months of 2021 after a record 9-point month-over-month jump. Companies are also reporting job openings remain hard to fill, although that index has also been on the decline alongside hiring plans. This month, the reading was unchanged at 46, the lowest level since June 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-2.png))**

&gt; Sales components have experienced far greater degrees of deterioration than employment metrics. The outlook for general business conditions has rallied back somewhat in the past few months, but it remains well below its historical range. Given the weakness in small businesses' economic outlook, few report now as an opportune time to expand their businesses. Actual sales changes dropped to -8 in October which matched August for the weakest showing for sales since August 2020. Back in 2020 though, this index was far lower than it is now.

&gt; While the reading on the top line has held up relatively well, high inflation has meant the bottom line has taken a big hit. A net 30% of small businesses reported earnings have fallen. That reading did improve last month, though, as there have been fewer businesses reporting higher prices. In spite of those improvements, each of those indices has a long way to go until returning to what have historically been more normal levels.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-3.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, a historically low share of businesses are reporting positive sentiment on the economy and that has dampened their hopes of expansion. When questioned on the reason for not expanding, 44% reported economic conditions as the reason. Another 17% reported economic conditions as the reason for uncertainty on whether or not they would expand. Aptly coming out on Election Day, we have highlighted in the past the political nature of the NFIB survey. As such, it should come as little surprise that the next biggest reason for small business hesitancy in expanding has been the political climate. Assuming the survey results react to the current election in a similar way as in the past, a strong election showing for Republicans could provide a boost to small business sentiment and plans for expansion. Finally, given continued high inflation and rates rising to combat it, the next two most widely mentioned reasons to not expand were the cost of expansion and financial conditions and interest rates with a combined 9% of responses.

&gt; # What's Bothering Small Businesses?

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, the pandemic trends of tight labor markets and high inflation continue to show up in the latest NFIB survey of small business optimism, albeit readings have begun to roll over. The survey also questions firms on what they perceive to be their most pressing problems. Perhaps even more than the other indices in the report, the results of these questions have shown how front and center labor and inflation concerns continue to be.

&gt; As shown below, most problems have seen record or near-record lows. Meanwhile, two-thirds of responses report either cost or quality of labor or inflation as their biggest problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-Table.png))**

&gt; At 33%, inflation as the single most important problem has well surpassed the previous record high set during what was a much less dramatic inflationary spell in 2008. Although this reading rose 3 percentage points versus September, it is in the middle of the past few months' range. In other words, inflation is slightly less of a concern than it was a few months ago (which is confirmed by the decline in the higher prices index), but that is certainly not to say it is no longer the single most pressing problem.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-1.png))**

&gt; Another third of responses reported either cost or quality of labor as their biggest issues. Quality is the bigger concern of the two—which is normal from a historical perspective—accounting for a 23% share.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-4.png))**

&gt; As we frequently note, the NFIB survey has a tendency to be impacted by politics with a bias towards Republican administrations. For example, during the Bush and Trump years, there was a far lower share of respondents reporting government requirements and taxes as their biggest concerns. With the prominence of inflation, Biden's tenure has resulted in a different scenario in which these issues have been placed on the back burner. Granted, these issues still account for the most pressing problem of a combined 17% of responses. We would also note, these readings have seen some dramatic moves around midterm election months, but those have not always been lasting.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/110822-NFIB-MIP-2a.png))**

&gt; Finally, we would note that very few businesses (only 3%) are worried about poor sales. That is a record-low share and unchanged for the third month in a row. As we noted in our discussion of the other areas of the report, that lack of concern for the top line contrasts with businesses' hopes for expansion and the outlook for the economy. In fact, of the reasons given for firms reporting now as not a good time to expand, sales prospects were the least pressing reason given.

&gt; # Beyond the Midterm Elections…Less Uncertainty and Historically Solid S&amp;P 500 Performance

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/a5f6008c34de7421fb4219e162491342/1e76828c24e4974c-2b/s500x750/6ec4edf19bebdc462cd466a8ca166dc72a5e9eaa.jpg))**

&gt; It is finally Election Day and hopefully soon the results will start rolling in. Once the outcome is known, it will likely alleviate some of the uncertainty that has been contributing to the market’s volatile trading which could help the market snap out of its Fed-induced funk. In the chart above the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the last 18 midterm-year elections appear (NASDAQ since 1974). Prior to 1969 the market was closed on Election Day so the close on the day before was used. By 60 trading days after the election (approximately three months), DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ were higher on average from 6.4% to 9.2%.

&gt; Digging deeper into the data, the following table shows S&amp;P 500 performance 1-, 3-, 6- and 12-months after the election. 1- and 3-months after the election S&amp;P 500 was higher 77.8% and 88.9% of the time respectively. By 6-months and 1-year after, S&amp;P 500 was always higher, although gains did slow after 6-months. Years when the President’s party lost its majority in Congress are shaded in gray.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/AIN_1222_20221103_Midterm_Election_Forward_Table.jpg))**

&gt; The Sweet Spot of the 4-year cycle is now. The headwinds that abound this time around are not entirely unlike past midterm years that have historically been mired by bear markets and uncertain economic and political times. Many of the current concerns do appear to be accounted for by the market’s declines coming into Q4. Inflation does remain stubbornly high despite the Fed aggressively raising rates this year. The Fed’s most recent statement may not have been as dovish as some had hoped for, but it did contain language that suggested the time to slow the pace of increases and possibly even pause hikes is closer now than it was six months ago. The market is likely to remain volatile as it awaits more clarity from the Fed and more signs that inflation is easing. Any back and fill periods by the market are likely an opportunity to consider adding to existing long positions or establishing new longs.

There will be many posts like this, in this bear, and in every bear, until CBDCs are the only legal crypto, if that ever happens.

Let me try to explain again:

&gt; Disintermediated, trustless, decentralized,… that's crypto.
&gt; 
&gt; You take those out, all you have is psychopaths running scams.
&gt; 
&gt; You regulate the psychopaths, you get TradFi.

The value proposition of crypto is in the disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. There's:
- No intermediate psychopath in the top 1% to try to regulate.
- No intermediate psychopath in the top 1% that you need to trust.
- No organization centralized in a psychopath in the top 1% answering to congress, lobbying, going to jail,…

If you add those things, you get CBDCs. CBDCs are not necessarily bad, they allow for tokenization of the economy: stocks, commodities, ETFs, ETCs, ETNs, CFDs, mortgages, all kinds of derivatives,… everything (really).

However, CBDCs are not decentralized, trustless, or disintermediated. Arguably, you do not need a blockchain for CBDCs, a database will do as long as it follows some standards (shared by the intermediaries to exchange the tokens). CBDCs are TradFi.

TradFi is not necessarily a bad thing as much as it is a necessary evil for current modern societies. At least until we have better alternatives, if they are allowed to exist. The tokenization of TradFi would be an improvement, inspired and motivated by crypto, but it is not a paradigm shift.

The paradigm shift is disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. Sorry for the repetition. Many more people will be repeating similar words in every and each bear, every time people forget “not your keys, not your coins”, until it is:

* unnecessary, because the paradigm shift is clear, or
* useless, because it has been prevented, and there are only CBDCs, if any tokens.

I know it is important to remind these words, because in every bull they are forgotten and replaced with profit, taxes, adoption, etc. Then, intermediaries appear as friendly entrepreneurs that are going to give you risk free returns beyond the boring returns of TradFi.

Boomers investing in the S&amp;P 500 just don't get how dogs and apes are so much better investments to have a chance at retiring, ever. Then, crypto just goes up because it is not constrained by any fundamental value, only the speculative value and its ponzinomics. Until the next bear brings rationality back. Because no bull is forever.

The fundamental value of crypto is in its disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization. If it wasn't valuable and important, China would not have banned it, every other week.

With central banks causing decades high inflation (supposedly transitory) and a recession to stop it, the value proposition of crypto and how TradFi fails and causes pain should be more clear than ever.

But crypto is not only Bitcoin and algorithmic monetary policy anymore, it is tokenization, and more importantly, disintermediation, trustlessness, and decentralization.

CryptoCurrency,So let's say Binance fell next and then Tether collapsed right after.,"What would happen? Would you be one of the first to run and never look back? Would you laugh as you buy with every last penny you can come up with cause you're now a ' guaranteed ' multi millionaire if you just play the long game. I personally think the market would reach near death levels.

It would take longer than a regular cycle to recover considering we're in essentially a recessionary period and higher interest rates too. I personally think if it did happen 99% of people including this sub would chicken out and then complain in 6-8 years when the people that did wait and take their shot are now retired millionaires that work for themselves.

In this current bear market I believe the market will bottom out at about 300-400 million dollars.

CryptoCurrency,We are going to be fine.,"Today's bitcoin price is 16800 dollars and in January 2018 the price of Bitcoin reached a peak of 17527$.

  


  


  


But what really has changed since then?

  


  


  


Everything

  


  


  


It seems we are following Murphy's law which states that everything that could go wrong will go wrong.

  


  


  


Let's go through some of the events that took place:

  


  


  


1) COVID happened which initially brought the bull with the government distributing money like candies but slowly the real effects showed up which brought rampant inflation that we are still dealing with.

  


  


  


FED increased rates in response which further pushed the price down.

  


  


  


2) Terra Collapse: Luna , UST and other tokens in the ecosystem had a worth of 60 billion $ before it went belly up.

  


  


  


A major stablecoin just went poof.

  


  


  


3) Russia-Ukraine War: A freaking war is happening right now btw nuclear power Russia and Ukraine backed by nuclear powers , that's literally the worst nightmare for any market especially for something as volatile as crypto market.

  


4) Celsius and voyager went down and with that took away a lot of investors money and belief in crypto.

  


5) FTX collapse: And now one of the biggest exchanges went bust like that locking off the user's funds and to top it off it now has an exploit too.

  


Everything has been pretty bad but still we have almost held on to the 2018 prices and we have a lot more adoption than before ,like a lotttt.

So yeah , we are going to be fine , we just need the bear to weed out some of the bad actors , a little bit of favor from powell and some time and will come out of this stronger than ever.

CryptoCurrency,Financial Transparency without Federal Regulation,"We’re at a point where we all need to come together.  One thing I’ve always wondered is why we don’t form a committee as investors, which requires some element of formalized reporting by all CEXs and DEXs.

Something like a simple website like a CoinGecko where financials are stored for anyone to view at anytime.  If an entity did not disclose their financial state it would be widely known by investors.  

By making it standard practice, a majority of folks would likely not participate on the platforms whom did not file quarterly financials.  I know some knuckleheads still would like the yolo’ers and the apy chasers.

Today all projects publish whitepapers.  It’s become a standard practice.

So what prevents us from forming something like a *“r/CC DAO”* where we collectively start requiring either quarterly financial statements or proof of reserves to be published.  Or you won’t see us using your product/platform/network…

I would think failure to cooperate would hinder growth, eventually making reserve transparency standard operating procedure.  **Why do we need formal government regulation for this?**  Why can’t we just do this ourselves and enforce it by abandoning projects which do not cooperate?

Edit: I’m seeing some replies saying “we can’t enforce it…”.  

The only enforcement I’m suggesting is banding together, meaning that we as a community do not engage with those projects/platforms which are not transparent.  

Im also just saying to make the information available in a central repository for anyone to read and interpret as they please.  Just like a white paper on GitHub.  No formal reviews or auditing.",cryptocurrency,1668263490

stocks,Another massive rally in this Bear Market - Where do we go from here?,"So with another massive rally, many people are surely wondering if we've seen the bottom. Personally, I think we've seen the bottom for this year. It would take something new and unexpected to see new lows before end of year in my opinion.

For now, I think this rally has legs until January. Here's my rationale:

* We've likely reached peak inflation fear now that CPI has started rolling over.
* Fed rate hike odds and the fear surrounding that has also likely peaked, and appears to be priced in by bonds.
* More certainty in the markets post mid-term election.
* Hedge Funds / Money managers who need to ""catch up"" are going to press this thing. I expect a series of higher lows and higher highs like back in June-Aug.
* Positive seasonal trends (Christmas rally, January effect)

Now this doesn't mean we just rally non-stop, I think there's going to be a lot of chop and ultimately we can top out around S&amp;P 4200. That said, after all that's done and the market has convinced everyone the Bear is dead, that's when we should start seeing the effects of the rate increases on the economy in Q2-4 next year. The only thing that matters at the end of the day are corporate profits and how high interest rates are.

The average forward P/E on the market over the last 10 years is 17x. That's with effectively 0% interest rates and QE. Before infinite QE and ZIRP, the average P/E multiple was around 15x.

Next year earnings (EPS) for the S&amp;P are expected to be at around 230, so at S&amp;P 4000 we're trading at a 17.5x forward P/E multiple (historically high).

Earnings will likely come down in 2023 as higher interest rates work their way through the economy. Looking at Analyst estimates for next year EPS, The Bear case is EPS of 200, Base case is 215, and Bull case is 230. 

Using the Base Case middle of the road EPS range for next year (215), let's assume a 16x multiple (which makes sense in a higher interest rate environment). That would put the fair value of the S&amp;P for 2023 around 3440.

Obviously there's much more to it than just P/E, but this is the framework I'm using to think about the potential trading range we could expect in the coming months. Would love to hear others thoughts on this and challenge my biases.",finance,1668279472

For disclosure purposes, I am now fully net long in my individual stock portfolio which consists of mainly semiconductors after buying heavily in the leadup to the CPI number we just encountered. In previous post, I warned against speculating on a Fed pivot and I'm fully aware of the risk for semiconductors and other individual stocks that I own. But that is beside the point. The main question is: ""What level is enough?"" Numerous companies from Amazon to Apple and from Fed Ex to Target have warned of consumer confidence tanking and slowing sales. This is direct evidence of consumer demand falling which should lead to falling inflation. With guidance comes certainty and with certainty comes probability. The probability is that investors have potentially priced enough falling demand for companies and the effects of high inflation. Despite the recent rally we have had, most companies have still fallen 30% to 50% except for value and consumer staple stocks.

personalfinance,Getting a divorce and trying to determine the best way to buy out my wife's equity in the house so I can keep it (US),"Hi, unfortunately I am going through a divorce and am trying to assess whether I can afford to keep our house given that a) I would have to buy out her half of the equity, which we agreed is $75k, and b) I will have the additional expenses of spousal and child support, which are estimated to be anywhere between $1650 - $2100 per month due to our large income disparity and the length of our marriage.

I've contacted my mortgage lender (who is known to give good rates) and investigated a refinance that includes the amount I would need to borrow to buy her out. The option that minimizes the monthly payment is actually a 5-year fixed mortgage, which would increase my monthly mortage payment from $1,406 to $1,681. Note that rates are much higher than the last time we refinanced back in 2020, so that would increase from like 3.5% to 5.75%, though obviously that's accounted for in the monthly payment.

A friend also mentioned the possibility of keeping the current mortgage (which is a 20-year), seeing if my lender offers a liability release for my soon-to-be-ex-wife, and looking into some kind of bridge loan to buy her out, for which I'd need to borrow about $60k. So the question is whether anyone has a good feel as to whether that potential avenue is likely enough to result in a low housing payment and/or overall expense to warrant further investigation. My understanding is that bridge loans typically have pretty high interest rates. Are there any other options for buying her out that I haven't thought about?

Not really relevant to the question, but I did take the time to enter all of my finances since Jan 01, 2021 into gnucash, and determined average monthly expenses (reduced by 10% to take into account one less adult living in the house) so that I have a pretty confident idea of what spousal and child support payments I can afford to have and still keep the house with the refinance option. This also sets me up to track things carefully post-divorce, and there are probably expenses I can cut if need to, such as eating out less.

EDIT: In response to many of the answers, based on the numbers, the 5-year loan I mentioned *has* to in fact be 5-year adjustable rate mortgage where evidently the rate stays fixed for the first 5 years. Also, I'm sure my parents would be willing to take my wife's place on the existing mortgage for liability purposes, assuming that this is something that the lender typically would allow, and it makes sense that it would not be in the lender's interest to simply release her from liability.

It sounds like a HELOC might be a preferable option here, but you guys seem to know better than I how those work exactly. After some cursory reading, it sounds like it works similarly to a credit card that you can make charges against, which I'm assuming means that my wife would have to accept payments rather than the lump sum she would get in with the refinance option, and I don't know whether that would be acceptable to her. Is my understanding correct here? Also what would be the rate of this credit line, would it simply be the \~3.5% mortgage rate I have now, or would it be higher like a normal credit card might be (or somewhere in between)? Is the monthly payment I'd need to make on this LOC likely be be similar or less than the $281 increase that I'd see in my mortgage payment with the full refinancing? Perhaps that answer depends on what payments she'd be willing to accept, i.e. how much I'm charging to the LOC per month or what have you.

Lastly, I *really* appreciate everyone chiming in with advice on this. I make decent money, but I am mostly financially ignorant compared to you guys, so I really appreciate everyone's insights.",finance,1668293725

stocks,Short terms bonds while easing into etfs,"Hey everybody. 

I recently came into a $360.000 investment. I've been following the stock market for quite some time and been dabbling with much smaller sums. On drying that seems certain for me is that there's a lot of volatility right now, and uncertainty about the next 12-ish months. Seems like inflation is steadily peaking and the fed is going to be easing up on the rate hikes. However, am i correct to understand that the consequences of the high rates and inflation have yet to really hit the marker? 

It's a bit daunting to start investing with larger sums of money so i thought I'd run my plan by you guys, see what comes up. Any insights are highly appreciated.

I'm planning on eventually splitting the money between stocks/bonds about 65/35 ( 240/120k), and a small sum for crypto. I won't be picking individual stocks, but will go for broad ETFs. Currently thinking of 
- 40% world
- 30% s&amp;p500
- 10% europe
- 5% emerging markets
- 5% health
- 5% energy
- 5% tech.

Given the high volatility and probability of another dip in the next year, I'd prefer to transition to ETFs slowly. Of the 240k allotted for etf's, I'd keep about 100k immediately available to ease into ETFs at ±10.000 a month (sometimes more, sometimes less depending on the situation at the time, but every month without fault) for the first 6 months of 2023. The other 140 I'd invest in short terms bonds (±6 months). So they become available when i need them at the 6 month mark. At that point i decide how to proceed ( get into ETFs quicker or again invest a percentage in short term bonds an repeat the proces), from there with hopefully a little more certainty about the state of the market.

My thinking is that this way i get the secure, relatively high returns from the short term bonds while easing into etf's and still having a small buffer available to invest larger sums should the market take a dive. Overall, I'd reach the 65/35 etf/bond ratio and become fully invested in 18-24 months.

 All DOD/federal buildings that have any dealings with classified materials don't allow bluetooth/wireless capable keyboards, mice, and other electronic devices inside their buildings. It's literally illegal to connect them to any of their computers. It's not just the transmission capability, it's the hack-abitability of bluetooth. All government employees that deal with cyber security are told to keep their bluetooth on their PEDs off, along with covering up their cameras, among other things. There's a good reason for it.

personalfinance,Creating a plan to get out of credit card debt.,"Im awful with money and I need to pay my credit cards off. I’ve created a major financial issue in my life getting them and im currently making a budget for when I buy a home and im almost 7k in debt because of credit cards.

With the budget I’ve created so far I’ve realized im wasting money. There are a few cards I can pay off pretty quick but it will still be around 6k I need to pay off.  So im wondering if I should take a loan out instead to pay them all off then just pay on the loan every month? In all honesty I have no idea what I’m doing and im just kind of winging this. Im tired of being pay check to pay check and need to get my life in order. If this isn’t the right place to post could you point me in the right direction?

Edit: After being roasted about going on Amazon, being awful about buying things and so on I guess I should have said it’s not necessarily me overspending on things. I don’t buy random stuff on Amazon. I cook at home and very rarely go out to eat.  4/5 of my streaming services are free through my vzw account and the majority of my credit card debt is from getting my car fixed and things I had to actually have but didn’t have the cash for it then so I put it on cc. and interest rates have gotten me. I appreciate the help and the direction people have put me too. I said I’m awful with money because I haven’t been able to get out of this hole I’ve dug in cc debt.

ethereum,How do stablecoins make money? ELI5,"Hi everyone!

Does anyone know how stablecoin issuers like Circle, Tether and MakerDAO make money? It's all a bit unclear to me and after recent events I have started to do more due diligence about crypto products. Some of them are really unclear or I'm just stupid.

personalfinance,Relationships with different incomes &amp; values.,"I've never considered speaking to a financial adviser for usual reasons i.e.  assuming they are there to make money out of me but I'm in a situation where its very hard to be unemotional and would appreciate an independent viewpoint. In this situation is there any value to them? 
Briefly (ok turned out to not be brief at all) . I live with my partner who is a very high earner with zero savings. We are a blended family – he has 3 children and I have 1. We live in an extremely expensive city and due to exs and schools etc we cant leave for at least 10 years. We pay approx 1000 a week on rent and own no property. The rent around us is increasing significantly and in fact we are underpaying around $300 weekly so are expecting a rent increase very soon (or will have to move and therefore find an equivalent house). To buy a house for 6 people will be around 1.5mil + so mortgage around $1770 pw assuming 5%. 

So my situation is that I am an average earner that has saved approx enough for a decent deposit on a 2 bed apartment ( in this city – could buy a house somewhere else) that could house my daughter and I. I also invested steadily in ETFS which I could sell. I did not buy property 6 years ago when I met my partner as assumed we would move in together and buy somewhere. This meant that property prices have increased significantly, and my buying power has been almost destroyed. Meanwhile unfortunately, despite his very high salary he has not managed to save a deposit. Some of this is his fault and some of it is bad luck. For him to match my deposit it will take years and that means house prices will be even higher ( they are dropping a little right now but due to increased interest rates still crazy $$)  

 So, my issue is this what to do now? If we stay renting in this city prices will increase annually. If we buy a 4 /5 bedroom house I will have to use my entire life savings as a deposit, which to be honest makes me incredibly nervous. It’s taken me years and a lot of discipline to get to this point. It will, however, give me a stake in a house that I would never be able to afford normally. We do not have joint finances due to the blended situation ( and TBH some resentment from me around being the saver when he earns so much) so I don't know where I could start with trying to work out who pays what. He of course due to his larger income and more kids would pay a much larger proportion of the mortgage (and of course I would never get this kind of mortgage without his income but equally he could not without my deposit) Having been divorced once I am loath to risk it all again but equally, I don’t want to continue renting / leave my amazing, noisy, new family. So I guess I need advice re should I buy an IP outside of this city that I can leave to my daughter / and that I or hopefully we can retire in one day. Or should I throw it all in with my partner and accept that even with a small deposit that it's better than renting and it will hopefully increase in value over the years. Genuinely I don’t know what the right thing to do here is. Would love to hear peoples views / thoughts of F advisers",finance,1668340583

I believe Wall Street has ridiculous expectations for endless accelerating growth which just doesn’t seem realistic to me (hence such a balloon in derivatives and a serious detachment from real life GDP). We can continue these cycles but at some point things have to seriously break and we are at the end of an 80 year debt super cycle so is this the moment?

I do have an emergency fund, so am not worried about that. 

My initial move was to max out my 401k (typical employer match) &amp; roth IRA. That would be about $1800/mo pre-tax for the 401k and $500 / mo post-tax for the roth IRA (will increase a bit in 2023). Then I wanted to try to save $1900 / month toward a car, downpayment on a house, and wedding. That leaves me with around \~4k / month left over for rent and etc. I live in a HCOL area, and pay $1500 in rent. 

On paper that seems like so much and should be more than enough, but in practice I've been having 'one-time' expenses constantly. For instance, I had to go to seven weddings in 2022. So in reality I have been setting aside a less than the $1900 / month I was hoping to. 

What I am wondering is if I should reconsider maxing out my 401k and roth IRA. I feel like I have catching up to do, and want to put as much into retirement as possible. However, my fiancee and I are getting older, and want to start a family before pregnancy gets too dangerous. My main concern is money for a downpayment on a house (once prices and interest rates hopefully get a bit better).

I understand most people are sick and tired about the FTX debacle but there are more swans on the horizon. One of which is the most important one, tether.

I can’t imagine Tether not having billions of dollars locked in FTX and FTT. So has anybody heard about this or is there anything we can check? Since they don’t share their balance sheet. 

It’s just logical for THE digital dollar to have a bunch of money and debt of THE number 2 exchange. 

Besides, crypto has never been in this economic climate with high rates and inflation this bad.

* Owners of existing solar retain current net metering rates
* Average export rate in California cut from $0.30 per kilowatt to $0.08 per kilowatt, time-of-day applies
* Additional credits for installing solar + storage
* Allows installation of solar systems covering 150 percent of a customer’s electricity usage to accommodate future electrification of appliances and vehicles.
* Proposed $8/kw monthly fees eliminated
* Includes features to benefit low-income homeowners

&amp;#x200B;

**This proposal will be on the CPUC’s Dec. 15, 2022 Voting Meeting agenda.**

The California rooftop solar market has grown to a robust 1.3 million homes covered with panels, representing about 50% of the US residential market.

Californians added 13 GW of solar energy to the state, roughly the output of six Diablo Canyon-sized nuclear power plants.  (but not at night!!! /s)   In addition, consumers have added nearly 1 gigawatt of energy storage which helped keep the lights on during recent heat waves.

**Payments for power fed to the grid will be tied to the “avoided cost” to the utility, a small fraction of the retail rate paid by customers for electricity supplied by the grid.**  CPUC claimed the new proposed decision will lead to an average payback of nine years for residential rooftop solar, based on an assumption of a $3.30 cost per Watt installed.

personalfinance,Purchase a House and Trying to Decide How Much in excess of 20% to Put Down.,"Some background:
1. We have a home we live in and plan to rent. We are at 2.375%  and pay roughly $2400 all-in, and are extremely confident at clearing $600-700 a month in rent (conservatively). In a very desirable area with good schools and near a bunch of regulatory and biotech. In Maryland.

2. We are looking to put an offer on a house that's approximately $900K - we are moving, not as an investment goal, but to get a bit more room for the family and to accommodate my mother. We have the cash to put down half of the sale amount and still keep $80K as our working savings, which I feel comfortable with (we are both permanent fed employees with good job stability). If we put $475K down, our monthly mortgage amount on the new house basically drops in half (due obviously to the loan amount and the more favorable interest rate for this LTV). While we could swing the $5K monthly mortgage amount at 20% down, the allure of $2880 or so at 50% down appeals to the conservative side in me. We are envisioning staying here 10 years at least. I know you guys may be thinking that we should be buying a more expensive house given our available cash, but we just don't really think we need one.

What would you guys do? Put down just the 20%, hold on to the extra cash and suck up high monthly payment in hopes of a retrace in rates back down? Or dump $475K and have a bit more peace of mind in case this is the new normal in rates? Is there a general rule of thumb that applies here?

personalfinance,Paid Federal Estimated Taxes to State; Paid State Estimated Taxes to Federal,"I feel really dumb.

I run a sole proprietorship and, when I get a larger payment, I just pay taxes on it right away - both State (MO) and Federal. I saved the two websites to my favorites.

Well, I realized that I mixed them up for the last two big payments, and so I greatly overpaid state and greatly underpaid federal. I did this *twice*.

* In March 2022, I paid $2,607.50 to the state; It should have went to the IRS.
* In March 2022, I paid $711 to the IRS; it should have went to the state.
* Just today, I paid $3,455.88 to the state; it should have went to the IRS.
* Just today, I paid $942.38 to the IRS; it should have went to the state.

Thus, overall this year, I overpaid state by $4,410.00 and underpaid the IRS by $4,410.00.

What should I do? I am thinking of just writing a check to the IRS for $4,410.00 and then calling up the state tomorrow. I figure they'd be easier to work with. Maybe I'll just get a giant tax refund from the state.",finance,1668387661
CryptoCurrency,Why Hasn’t the Market Crashed Yet?,"With all of this insanity this week you would think at the very least you’d think BTC would be closer to $13-$15k and ETH well under $1,000 again.

They were around the Luna disaster , but for some reason there’s a level of floor that isn’t being broken. This is also amidst various reports that people are buying and attempting to move these holdings in FTX for a fraction of what they are worth.

Who knows how credible that all even is.

Yet the floor remains the same.

I’m no bull or moon boy by any means. I like my bears fat.

But if this week couldn’t put BTC &amp; ETH to new yearly lows what even could?

There’s some solace in that for BTC and ETH. But as for any other alt - you just never know.

There’s no Fed pivot and no stimulus coming to save this market any time soon, despite what the hopium folks try to post. What you’ve seen this week could be our new reality.

Prepare yourselves, if you’re using an exchange be cautious and stay aware &amp; engaged. Please use wallets be it custodial or web based.

All of your crypto depends on it.

If you didn’t learn from this - then you’ll never learn.

CryptoCurrency,Questions about Binance's Solvency/Safety,"So I've thought of opening a Binance US account (I'm US based so I don't have a choice) to day trade since they have BTC trading with no maker/taker fees, but while looking into it I found [one particular aspect about Binance to be quite concerning](https://www.binance.com/en/earn). For example they pay up to 5.20% for staking ETH, but the APR stated on the [Ethereum Foundation's website is 4.40%](https://ethereum.org/en/staking/) APR. I also found that they're also paying 10.90% for ADA, while the calculator on [cardano.org](https://cardano.org) shows [the rate is 4.6% no matter how much you stake.](https://cardano.org/calculator/?calculator=delegator) Then for DOT, they're paying 21.79% APR while [polkadot.network](https://polkadot.network) states that [staking on chain can get you up to 18% APR.](https://polkadot.netwoxrk/staking/) Not only is this, but they're paying 5% APR on USDT and 6.00% on BUSD, which is much higher then even the highest US treasury bonds (ignoring I Bonds) and aren't able to be staked on-chain for rewards and are higher than the stated APR for staking ETH on chain. Am I not understanding how staking works or is something up with Binance? Because the fact that Voyager, Celsius, and FTX had higher than average or normal interest rates on crypto that you held or staked so this is raising some red flags for me and I'd like to hear what you guys think and maybe get a possible explanation as to why they're able to pay so much for staking rewards compared to on-chain staking.

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: The staking rates seem [different for the US version](https://www.binance.us/staking), for ETH it's 6.00 APY, ADA it's 4.00%, and for DOT it's 9.00%.",cryptocurrency,1668393333

This is a general question to you all to see if there is anything else I should be doing to be in better financial position (I.e., increase wealth). We are 2 working parents to 2 kids who will soon start elementary school. We max out our 401k savings each year, have built a decent emergency fund, have money invested in index funds and some stocks, have a mortgage loan but no other debt, 529 account for kids and have an annual target saving of 30% of gross income. Savings go towards planned home projects/investing. Other than reducing our expenses to save more and invest more, are there other things we should consider? We did consider investing in real estate but quickly realized it is not realistic for us given the lack of inventory, lack of time to look after the property, and now the high interest rate. We also don’t have any skills or talent for side hustles (always in awe of people who do!). So that leaves us to do more/be wiser with the money we make ….",finance,1668402054

economy,Current situation in Turkey (from a secular Turk),"A few months ago, I wrote about the situation in Turkey. It's time to update it. As long as Erdogan is president, Turkey has no chance of getting better. 
 We entered the election period economy. Erdogan is distributing generous support and credit. It distributes public housing. And it introduced an electric car, mostly made of imported parts.
Interest rates continue to be lowered, but interest rates at banks are higher. The dollar rate is constantly depressed. Official inflation reached almost 90%. After that, they hope it drops with the base effect.
 Most of the people are devastated. Our children go to school hungry. Eating healthy is very expensive. Being a student is also very difficult. I have to work. Because the government only gives me $45 a month support. Erdogan and his team have no chance to fix the economy.
 Price increases are subsidized by our taxes. Turkey still has large debt and negative foreign exchange reserves. In this case, we don't have much time left. It is predicted that TRY will lose some more value by the end of the year.

CryptoCurrency,"CEX ""Proof of Reserves"" and what it all means for the lay person.","I thought I would put this post together in light of what is going on with CEX's and them rushing to post ""proof"" of their reserve assets. This doesn't touch on the possible practice of some CEX's sending funds back and forwards to each other for their ""Reserve snapshots"" to seem like they have more assets on  the books then they usually would, this is a look at what Reserve Assets actually are and what they are really worth.

I'll use Binance as the example because they have recently published their reserves.

On 10th November 2022, Binance released details of its cold wallet addresses and balance's of the top 6 coins listed on Binance

&amp;#x200B;

BTC - 475,000

ETH- 4.9 million

USDT - 17.6 Billion

USDC - 601 million

BUSD - 21.7 billion

&amp;#x200B;

I'll touch very briefly on stable coins.

**Algorithmic Stable Coins:** I think most of us now understand the fallacy that algorithmic stable coins are after the demise of LUNA/UST... If you don't yet grasp it, the short answer is ALL algorithmic stable coins create a systemic risk event and its not IF but rather WHEN that gets trigger into a catastrophic failure. The reason this happens is that the risk models allow for the 80% and discard the outlier 20% risk events, meaning they have ZERO protection from any of these outlier ""black swan"" events. You could not pay me enough money to hold algorithmic stable coins!

&amp;#x200B;

**Stable coins:** This is a catch all for all the rest of the stable coins. These are as good and stable as the assets that back them and more importantly, the LIQUIDITY of the assets that back them! I'll use Binance's BUSD as an example here because they are at least somewhat transparent as to what is backing it (Though I'm yet to see an independent audit, so its just ""Trust me Bro"" from Binance)

&amp;#x200B;

**BUSD is 100% backed by reserves held in either or both (i) fiat cash in dedicated omnibus accounts at insured U.S. banks1 and/or (ii) U.S. Treasury bills** (including through repurchase agreements and/or money-market funds invested in U.S. Treasury bills).

**BUSD Is** a Binance branded stable coin issued by Paxos Trust Company

[https://www.binance.com/en-AU/feed/post/50867](https://www.binance.com/en-AU/feed/post/50867)

Now, why are the assets and the liquidity important that back up a stable coin?

**Example:**

A bank run occurs and depositors want their money OUT of Binance. They don't want BUSD, they want FIAT back in their own bank accounts (where the FED can take it from them...) That leaves Binance in the position where in needs to redeem crypto assets for USD $. So that means selling off the assets that back the BUSD to free up USD to then wire out to depositors bank accounts. The types of assets Binance says backs BUSD are:

1 - FIAT cash. This is great, its the most liquid backing asset as it doesn't need to be sold, just moved from bank accounts and sent out to depositors withdrawing to their banks,

2 - US Treasury Bills. Again, another reasonably liquid asset at most times but there have been some issues in the foreign treasury markets recently so its not risk free... But US Treasuries are seen a the gold standard and liquid markets so in most cases having to fire sale a heap isn't going to crash Treasury markets.

&amp;#x200B;

**Getting back to Binance Reserves**

Total reserves of these 6 makes up $69 billion. Don't get focused on the $ value however. Take BTC and ETH as example's, the $ value that they make up could fluctuate considerably as market price moves up of down. The stable coins are stable as long as they remain pegged....

&amp;#x200B;

It has $69 billion in reserves MARKED TO MARKET! Mark to Market is an important concept to understand. Its the snap shot value of the assets based on the market price they were trading at when the snap shot was taken

**Example:**

Let's say Binance has 1,000,000 BTC on its books as reserves. BTC trading @ $16,200 = $16.2 billion in reserves.

Now, if BTC drops to $10,000, binance still has the 1,000,000 BTC but they are now worth $10 billion.

&amp;#x200B;

Just looking at the $ value of any CEX's reserves is pretty meaningless. What is important is the QUALITY of the reserves. If Binance was holding $69 billion of SHIB as its reserves.... I'd be pretty fuckin worried!

What is important when assessing ANY CEX's reserves are these points:

1 - What is the QUALITY of the reserves. Are they majority the CEX's own token (CEL, FTT, BSB and so on) or are they low quality ""shitcoins"". If so, proceed with caution!

2 - What is the QUANTITY of each coin held and what % of total coin issuance does that represent. If the CEX needs to suddenly dump onto the market to free up liquidity, that's going to effect price negatively and the Reserve asset value of that coin is meaningless! If a CEX is holding a large % of a tokens supply, proceed with caution!

3 - How LIQUID is the assets market. Coins with HUGE demand will likely always have buyers willing to buy so dumping a heap suddenly won't completely crash the value. Dump $16 billion of BTC on the market and BTC price will dip hard.... but it will recover. Dump $16 billion of FTT on the market and its price will fall off a cliff and never recover! If a CEX is holding a large % of its Reserves in illiquid coins, proceed with caution!

&amp;#x200B;

If the CEX has $5 billion of SHIB as its majority Reserves... depositors are cooked in a liquidity event! Would be lucky if that $5 billion of SHIB today is worth $5 million in a fire sale! So the reality is, reserves shouldn't be ""marked to market"" as there reserve valuation, it should be calculated at fire sale valuations because that's when it's going to be getting liquidated!

Even if the CEX carries the ""gold standard"" and holds BTC as its reserve assets.... Come a liquidity crisis, BTC price is taking a beating at least in the short term and CEX's will be forced to sell at the worst time, not the best.

Mark to market valuations of CEX reserves aren't worth the screen real estate they take up!

&amp;#x200B;

The current $ value of Reserves is only a SMALL part of assessing the financial viability of a CEX, what's more important is WHAT assets make up those Reserve assets that are to be called on to backstop a liquidity crisis! The ONLY thing that matters is how much those Reserves can be sold for in a WORSE CASE scenario.... Because that is their TRUE RESERVE VALUE!

&amp;#x200B;

Now in the case of a NON-Fractional system. If you deposit 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE into a CEX and that CEX then holds 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE to back your deposit claim... It doesn't matter WHAT happens in the market, what prices do.... If there is a bank run and you withdraw, you're getting back your 1 ETH, 1 BTC, 1 DOGE!

&amp;#x200B;

A FRACTIONAL CEX system will always carry liquidity risks.... ALWAYS! Be aware of it at all times and weigh those risks up on a individual level. I still use CEX's but I certainly don't keep all my portfolio on a single CEX or even multiple CEX's! Hot wallets are free to make and it doesn't hurt to have more then you need... Hard wallets are your most secure layer as always though.

&amp;#x200B;

Remember, Not your keys.... NOT your coins!",cryptocurrency,1668406058
personalfinance,my car situation… :),"About the situation - I financed a car 3 yrs ago at a ridiculously high interest rate and gradually built my credit to 700-725 range. My car is valued at $8000 today and I have saved up enough cash to pay off the loan - about $5000. I’m ready for an upgrade - I need a vehicle more reliable and comfy for road-trips. 

About me - I’m a full time med student happily working 2 side jobs to offset high cost of living in Los Angeles. Would be nice to not worry about $525/ month on car payment and insurance, plus the crazy expenses on gas. Luckily my school and office are both within walking/biking distance. I love using my car for camping and going on road trips.

Question: Should I pay off my car and sell it to a dealership? If so, what value should I sell it at? (KBB…) Or should I try to refinance the loan and lower my monthly payment? Or trade it in at a dealership? Do you have any recommendation on what’s my next vehicle could be? 

Super appreciate any comment on sharing your experience or advice. Also I genuinely love to hear a good story if you got one. Because oh well, medical school don’t teach this sh*t :) Thanks a million!! 

For reference my car is a 2013 BMW 328i X-drive at 130k miles. It runs perfect and looks fantastic. Drove this little beast across the country and I love it. Would love something a little bigger and reliable especially for going camping… yay outdoorsy adventure times :)",finance,1668407732

Economics,"Fed’s Waller warns inflation fight isn’t over, interest rates will ‘keep going up’ despite prices cooling by more than expected",,finance,1668421735
economy,"The shady bonds scandal involving Saigon Commercial Joint Stock Bank (SCB) and Tan Viet Securities Incorporation (TVSI), in which they sold bonds that appeared to be illegal to 40.000 saving customers in Vietnam.","This is the first time we have encountered a situation like this in our lives. So far, there has been no precedent for intentionally deceptive mishaps in the Vietnamese banking system, and the notion that ""the bank is the safest place"" has become inherently ingrained in the minds of ordinary citizens. Because of that belief, we are now in danger of losing all of our assets, which we have worked for years to acquire. Furthermore, by posting too few warning signs and withholding information about these bonds, people like us were unaware of things that should have been legally displayed to us. Let us explain how the situation unfolded. 
Our goal when visiting SCB Bank is to deposit money into savings accounts, many of which are held by long-term clients. However, SCB's bank clerks introduced us to a NEW FORM OF SAVINGS dubbed ""FLEXIBLE BOND SAVINGS,"" disguising it as a service provided by the bank itself, instead of acting as per our request. The bonds are flexible and can be withdrawn after 31 days, according to bank clerks. Please note that we do not request this product and are not even aware that it exists. This is an unsolicited sales pitch from the bank tellers at SCB; they made eminent promises to persuade us to deposit money there rather than in true safe savings accounts. The contract we formally agreed to is actually between us and TVSI (Tan Viet Securities Incorporation), and SCB, which is meant to be the transactional medium, is merely connecting clients to TVSI at this point.
We must emphasize that SCB's clerks purposefully misled customers about the bond product as a SCB-issued savings product. Based on customer psychology, SCB staff purposefully only disclosed the higher interest rate while omitting any mention of the risk of investing in it.
SCB prioritizes the interests of the business without clearly analyzing the corporate bond products distributed by SCB so that customers understand both benefits and risks; they exploit customer trust to  SCB Bank. Specifically and generally speaking,  SCB's clerks have been dishonest with customers, have lost professional ethics, and have violated social ethics

""INVESTORS,"" as they now refer to us, have no idea which company's bonds we purchased, let alone the status of business operations and the risk capacity and safety of each type of bond. SCB clerks encourage customers to sign the contract as soon as possible. After the contract is signed, SCB clerks stated that we will have to wait up to 15 days before they call us to pick up the contracts at the bank. Another important piece of information that they withheld from us was the fact that we could cancel the contract within three days of signing it, but because they only returned it after 15 days, we lost that opportunity.

Here's the shocking revelation: Truong My Lan, one of the wealthiest property developers in Vietnam, owns the majority of the bonds that SCB sold. Although she is not listed as one of the bank's largest shareholders, Truong My Lan was the driving force behind SCB Bank's founding. On October 7 , 2022, she was subsequently detained for bond fraud.
These are news reports on the arrest in both English and Vietnamese.
https://vnexpress.net/chu-tich-tap-doan-van-thinh-phat-truong-my-lan-bi-bat-4520410.html
https://tuoitrenews.vn/news/society/20221008/vietnamese-property-development-tycoon-arrested-for-bond-fraud/69459.html

We discovered following the arrest that the ""FLEXIBLE BOND SAVINGS"" contract we signed did in fact belong to Truong My Lan's affiliates. We didn't recognize we were bond investors prior to that; we thought we were SCB saving customers.
We have realized that TVSI and SCB purposefully mislead us by selling us very risky bonds that don't adhere to the legal requirements for financial safety and are only interested in making a profit. Regardless of their concern for their clients (both SCB and TVSI continue to offer bonds from Truong My Lan’s affiliates to clients even after the arrest).
As of this point in the investigation, as far as we are aware, SCB’s are reportedly working together to sell these junk bonds. Even branch managers participated in these illegal solicitation attempts against the bank's VIP clients, in addition to developing an illegal solicitation process and failing to organize or monitor the sales operations of bank clerks. For the 40.000 SCB customers who believed they were safely depositing their savings in their bank accounts, this has resulted in many terrible mistakes and serious repercussions. In reality, they were selling themselves out so that the bank's employees could profit from a successful transaction by receiving commissions.
Please keep in mind that we are ordinary citizens with limited knowledge of bonds. Many of the victims are seniors, new or long-term SCB customers. We were duped into buying bonds simply because there was a little more interest than usual. Some people have decided to deposit all of their future assets at SCB. We are now unable to withdraw funds and risk losing everything. This is a tragedy that none of us expected. We know nothing about bonds and have no desire to get rich quickly by purchasing them; however, we have become victims of this crisis due to our own ignorance and the deliberate self-interest of SCB and TVSI.
Unfortunately, because of the legal flaws in the contracts, we are completely disadvantageous in the eyes of the law. This causes many people to believe that we intentionally caused this problem by being greedy. Now, SCB and TVSI are blaming the company whose bonds we purchased and asserting that it alone, and not they, is capable of repaying us. Every day that goes by feels like torture to us. We currently have no choice except to wait for official assistance, yet everyone is ignoring us. This letter is intended to clarify and provide outsiders with our perspective on depositors like ourselves.
This tragedy is the first of its kind to occur in our nation. We don't know who to approach or which government agency to contact for assistance in getting our savings back; we are like deer in the headlights. In an attempt to get the government to take notice of our letter requesting that the major media cover our issue, so far nothing has happened. Many ""investors"" require medical assistance, as do families who risk losing their property or livelihood and are about to become homeless if they don't have enough cash to cover their mortgage, food costs, and everyday necessities like rent and utilities.  We are hoping that the international press receives this letter so that they can apply pressure to our government to act immediately to save our people. We cannot wait for the inquiry to be completed in order to find out whether or not these subsidiaries file for bankruptcy.

&gt; Stock futures traded lower Monday after the S&amp;P 500 posted its biggest weekly gain in almost five months on the back of easing inflation data.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 49 points, or 0.2%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures slid by 0.5%.

Fed Governor Christopher Waller said Sunday that, “We’re at a point we can start thinking maybe of going to a slower pace.” But, “we’re not softening. ... Quit paying attention to the pace and start paying attention to where the endpoint is going to be. Until we get inflation down, that endpoint is still a ways out there.”

Economics,Interest rates have risen sharply. But is monetary policy truly tight?,,finance,1668436732
CryptoCurrency,Crypto com is not down and it will probably stay that way,"All the news spreading around, all the FUD surrupnding them, it looke like they will really be going down. But they're not and the worst is proabbly behind them.

All this media and people on twitter felt like an attack against them. This had to cause tens and hundreds of millions of withdrawals. And they didn't halt them, everything is still up and going. 

They lowered the interest rates on locking crypto there significantly, they lowered the cashback in their cards, fired a lot of people, cut back on marketing hugely. They were prepared for this.

Their CEO is not some power and attention hungry maniac, I have to admit I didn't even knew who he was before this AMA he had earlier. He, like a true leader, stepped up when his company was in trouble and answered all the questions.

I agree that crypto com still gas a lot of question marks and could still go down without notice any day. But seeing how they dealt with this whole situation shows me that their management is really competent and knows what they're doing and I think they will not go down any time soon.",cryptocurrency,1668437979
stocks,Amazon Is Said to Plan to Lay Off Thousands of Employees this week,"The job cuts of approximately 10,000, which would start as soon as this week, would focus on the company’s devices organization, retail division and human resources.

Amazon plans to lay off approximately 10,000 people in corporate and technology jobs starting as soon as this week, people with knowledge of the matter said, in what would be the largest job cuts in the company’s history.

The cuts will focus on Amazon’s devices organization, including the voice-assistant Alexa, as well as at its retail division and in human resources, said the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.

The total number of layoffs remains fluid. But if it stays around 10,000, that would represent roughly 3 percent of Amazon’s corporate employees and less than 1 percent of its global work force of more than 1.5 million, which is primarily composed of hourly workers.

Amazon’s planned retrenchment during the critical holiday shopping season — when the company typically has valued stability — shows how quickly the souring global economy has put pressure on it to trim businesses that have been overstaffed or underdelivering for years.

Amazon would also become the latest technology company to lay off workers, which only recently it had been fighting to retain. Earlier this year, the e-commerce giant more than doubled the cap on cash compensation for its tech workers, citing “a particularly competitive labor market.”

Changing business models and the precarious economy have set off layoffs across the tech industry. Elon Musk halved Twitter’s head count this month after buying the company, and last week, Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, announced it was laying off 11,000 employees, about 13 percent of its work force. Lyft, Stripe, Snap and other tech firms have also laid off workers in recent months.

Brad Glasser, an Amazon spokesman, declined to comment.

The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record, as consumers flocked to online shopping and companies to its cloud computing services. Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.

But earlier this year, Amazon’s growth slowed to the lowest rate in two decades, as the bullwhip of the pandemic snapped. The company faced high costs from decisions to overinvest and rapidly expand, while changes in shopping habits and high inflation dented sales.

Amazon experienced a slight rebound in its latest quarter. But it has cautioned investors that growth could weaken again, possibly falling to its lowest pace since 2001.

What We Learned From Week 10 in the N.F.L.

The Anatomy of a Panic Attack

Giorgia Meloni and the Politics of Power Dressing
The company has told Wall Street that it has tightened its belt in the past and can do so again. Last week, Amazon executives met with institutional investors, according to three people, just as its stock sank to its lowest level since the early days of the pandemic, erasing $1 trillion in value since Andy Jassy took over as chief executive last year.

Mr. Jassy, who previously ran Amazon’s lucrative cloud computing business, has been closely scrutinizing businesses to trim costs quickly. He initially pulled back on a warehouse expansion that was supercharged during the pandemic, then moved to other parts of the company.

In recent months, Amazon has also closed or pared back a smattering of initiatives, including Amazon Care, its service providing primary and urgent health care that failed to find enough customers; Scout, the cooler-size home delivery robot, that employed 400 people, according to Bloomberg; and Fabric.com, a subsidiary that sold sewing supplies for three decades.

From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.

Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.

That news came so suddenly that recruiters did not receive talking points for job candidates until almost a week later, according to a copy of the talking points seen by The New York Times.

Devices and Alexa have long been seen internally as at risk for cuts. Alexa and related devices rocketed to a top company priority as Amazon raced to create the leading voice assistant, which leaders thought could succeed mobile phones as the next essential consumer interface. From 2017 to 2018, Amazon doubled staff on Alexa and Echo devices to 10,000 engineers. At one point, any engineer getting a job offer for other Amazon roles was supposed to also get an offer from Alexa.

The company has sold hundreds of millions of Alexa-enabled devices. But Amazon has said the products are often low margin and other potential revenue sources such as voice shopping have not caught on.

In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.

Amazon’s retail business, which covers its physical and online retail business and its logistics operations, has been under strain after the surge of demand and breakneck expansion during the pandemic. The company has said it has pulled back expansion plans, and has told investors it sees uncertainty with consumers.

“We’re realistic that there’s various factors weighing on people’s wallets,” Brian Olsavsky, the finance chief, told investors last month. He said the company was unsure where spending was heading, but “we’re ready for a variety of outcomes.”

stocks,It is important to remember that the stock market and the economy are two different entities.,"As unemployment may rise, and other worsening economic data may come out over the next 6-12 months, it is important to understand that the market is not the economy. 

To help illustrate, in the GFC, the market bottomed in March of 2009 while unemployment peaked in October of 2009. The reason? Government stimulus and the fed lowering rates which increased asset multiples, thus increased stock prices.

So if you see bad economic news, it ***may*** be a good thing for the market since it is a signal that interest rates will be lowered, thus increasing asset prices, as well as possible stimulus. BUT! I caution anticipating that support this time around since inflation is still \~7%. So it will be interesting to see if the fed/government intervene as quickly as they did in 2020/2008. As Carl Icahn recently noted, don't fight the fed. And unfortunately, the fed doesn't seem to be done yet with curbing demand to meet supply.",finance,1668445635

personalfinance,Positive equity in car - Should I sell?,"Here is the meat and potatoes. I own a 2018 Toyota Corolla Hatchback, I owe $12,000 and the monthly payment is $350. My wife’s car is a 2016 Toyota Corolla, she owes $1400 then it’s paid off. She works permanently from home now and doesn’t need to use her car as a daily driver. I got my car appraised at several different places and was offered about $14,000-$15,000 by each one. So if I sell my car we could pay of my loan and have $2000-$3000 left to pay the rest of her car off and have no car payments and only pay for insurance on one car. Seems like a no brainer, but there are some other factors to consider.

1. My vehicle is in way better condition, and has 40,000 less miles. Her car is reliable but it’s got a lot of cosmetic damage and needs tires/ engine light is on for the gas tank cover. If we put $500-$800 into it though it will last a long time (but it won’t be pretty).

2. I don’t struggle to make the $350 payment, but it would be nice to get rid of the $12,000 debt allowing us to save more money every month towards buying a house. 

3. Sharing one car will most likely work just fine for us but I do worry about those one off occasions where we both may need the vehicle at the same time.

Any thoughts or options are appreciated I am really stuck on the fence with this one. Thanks! *if it matters our combined gross income is just around 100k.

***update: Thanks for the advice. We have settled on not selling the car, I will instead be making extra payments (towards the principle balance) to get the car paid off sooner. In a year/year and a half we will have 2 paid off cars that each have under 100,000 miles and that are reliable. We will be moving in a few months and that may cause us to need both cars more often. So for now we are keeping them, I have a great interest rate and after doing research on the current car market I think keeping what I have is most wise. I’ll focus on clearing up some other debts as well instead of getting rid of the 12,000 from the car first.",finance,1668449046

personalfinance,Would it be financially wise to buy a Jeep?,"Hello folk,

I have a Honda HRV 2021 which I love. it has 1.99 APR and I pay $350 a month and 34mpg.

However, due to personal circumstances involving a sickness, I've decided to embark on a year long road trip from Alaska to Texas, around the US to live life for the first time in my life. I will quit my very well-paid job. I have $32k saved up, a small passive income, and the support from my parents. 

Only thing that worries me is my car. I'm scared for the roads, the weather changes, everything. Not sure if it's better to upgrade to a car better suited for the road trip but then the interest rates right now SUCK and my payment would most likely be in the $500s.  I owe 19k on the Honda right now, if I sell it I might profit $2-3k which I can use for a down payment I guess.",finance,1668460084
personalfinance,Sell brokerage account to help reach 20% down payment for a house?,"28M, 180k\~ asset worth trying to FIRE at 45. 115k a year as a Cyber Security Engineer at big tech. numbers are as follows:

* 34k cash 
* 79k 401k assets 
* 15k Roth IRA
* 28k brokerage portfolio.
* 4k HSA.

Trying to figure out how to approach this house situation. I have been living in rentals my whole life and figure the best option next for me is to get a property. Currently the range I am looking at is 400-450k. 

I wish to buy around the April/May time frame, and expect to have about 50-55k in cash to put for a down payment by then. With the money I have in the brokerage, if it stays in the current price range, I expect to be able to sell and get close to the 20% number for the house I am looking for.

I know putting a down payment on a place at lower interest rates isn't a good idea as the turnaround on your cash in the markets is most likely going to be better against a 3-4% rate mortgage. However, factoring in a rate for a couple of years of 6.5%-8.5%, I ponder if it is better to hit the 20% number for the time being.

I do plan on refinancing once rates go lower in a couple of years. I don't expect rates to stay this high and am willing to take a gamble that they will go lower (back to 4.5-5.5% in a couple of years)

What is the best approach for this going forward with my current portfolio and FIRE Goal?",finance,1668461262
personalfinance,Should I keep an emergency fund if I can simply pledge my stock portfolio in case of emergency,"This is just a thought - Is there any reason to keep a 10-20k emergency fund in place if I have a portfolio size of 50k+ where if life happens, I could transfer it to one of those fintech companies and take out a margin loan at a \~5.75% interest rate with 40% LTV. [https://m1.com/borrow/margin-loans/](https://m1.com/borrow/margin-loans/)  


I can see the risk if my portfolio declines in a significant way, I would have to put up more collateral or get a margin call. but as long as I could keep \~5x my emergency fund in the market, the market seems to have rarely dipped by more than 50% in a short timeframe (looking at S&amp;P 500). Not to mention, 5.75 interest is also a lot less than even the wall street journal prime rate at 7% in the current relatively high-interest rate environment.

personalfinance,"New job, new to having money and saving at 35. Where do I put house savings?","In the USA. Filing single. Almost 35 years old. Have struggled with having small income and hopelessly large debt for the entirety of my adult life. I finally locked on target and managed to reach my dream career which took me from the 12% tax bracket into the 24%. Room to grow, and a field with extremely high, and growing demand.

The compensation package through this company is overwhelming to me (a good thing!), and it's the first time in my life that I can actually save money in meaningful, strategic ways with options. It's a lot to take in all at once, so I've been looking at the Prime Directive here and probably spent about 4-6 hours so far browsing the subreddit learning lingo and the basics. Student debt is my only debt, so I will be almost completely debt free if/when this whole deal with the US fed goes to forgiveness.

&amp;#x200B;

So far:

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough in the bank at the moment for an Emergency Fund, currently set for 3 months, hoping to grow to 6-12 by April. Might be a bit lofty of a goal, but my plan was to keep it in my 2.2% APY MMA until right before the I-series bond 6.89% rate changes in April and then put most of the emergency fund in there and leave it long-term so I don't have to worry about losses, too much. Not sure if I can hit the 10K max in April, but also wanted to keep some months of emergency funds still in the MMA to act as a ""stacked"" first or second layer emergency fund before I might consider resorting to the I-bonds.

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement savings in a traditional 401(k).

Company matches 100%, up to 6% of income plus 3%. I chose to contribute 21% of my income to that because I started saving later in life. As I understand it, this should take me down to the next bracket for now.

Also maxing an HSA to get employer contribution there and for tax advantage.

Maybe index funds or something cool down the road, but not priority.

&amp;#x200B;

I plan on getting married sometime in the coming months. No house yet. Shooting to buy in \~3 years. Shooting for upwards of 30-40k by that time.

&amp;#x200B;

Question:

Is a ""house fund"" (downpayment) for 3 years out a good idea to keep in a HYSA/MMA or is it better in a ladder, like with treasury bills/CDs? I have a 2.2% APY MMA through my work, but I was eyeing a 3.38% MMA through UFB Direct. Is 3.38% worth it to park it all in versus a bunch of rotating T Bills/etc for 3 years? I figured I'd want quick access to it should the right house present itself suddenly 3 years from now. Are there other options I haven't considered?",finance,1668465541
cybersecurity,Which cybercriminals get caught?,"Hey there, student of cybersecurity making a suspicious post for genuine educational knowledge.

I’m curious what it actually takes for one to get caught and convicted for a cybercrime. The attitudes that have been echoed to me by cybersecurity professionals from corporations is that companies don’t typically care about tracking down an intruder as much as they do kicking them out and making them unable to get back in. 

So many cybercrimes are committed by people in countries that would be hard to extradite from, or state-actors, so many fly completely under the radar. It seems to me like stealing money from a large corporation is a good way to get caught, or doing something incredibly stupid with your IP and MAC unspoofed, anything else it’s free reign.

datascience,"How to address lack of progress and constant tardiness, no show to a data science project partner? How do you confront a non contributing coworker? Or how to tell your boss/Professor?","Over the last seven weeks my project partner and I have been building a data tool and there are significant accountability issues causing problems

He almost never shows up on time for our virtual code sessions. Of the nine times that we’re supposed to meet he’s showing up three on time and ready to go. Otherwise he’s anywhere from a half hour to an hour and a half late.

0. Our project lead assigned him to me because I was much more advanced and agreed to coach and mentor him but it’s like he thinks I’m going to telepathically teach him everything it’s like he doesn’t have the concept of how to study. Consequently he is completely lost in debugging and has just no idea even how to debug a basic python, import, syntax or any errors.

1. His code contribution is so insignificant as to not even be relevant so probably 70% of what is written is basic sequel which might take two hours.

2. When he does show up each time he tries to dance around and then finally admits that he’s having major challenges to able to get the code set up and running. So I end up doing a bunch of debugging on his windows machine to figure out the issue.

3. He seems so overwhelmed by the project, that his contribution is so tiny that I don’t even know if it gets beyond single digit percentage of the whole

4. He acts like it’s ok to excuse his behavior as there’s always something that comes up “had to work late”, “had to work early”, “not enough sleep”, “too much sleep”, lhad to walk the dog”, “had to get a bite to eat”.

5. I spent two hours last week getting pip and multiple things installed on his windows machine and he just had almost no idea what Linux commands to use.

6. He’s asked me twice “why we have to use this Linux stuff, why we can’t just load the data from excel”… wtf?

Dude we are we are loading it from a CSV file,with pandas into SQLite.

This would be a completely different conversation if he always made the meeting and said hey I have to leave early or I need to leave for a little bit and then come back he’s always like an hour or two hours late and I’m fed up. I’ve already mentioned this to the project lead/professor and she essentially ignored my comment. This project manager really isn’t proactive at all and I think her management approach is “don’t rock the boat”

His main responsibility was to work on ETL for loading csv files into a database, handling basic SQL python issues and bring the harder ones to me. So he has almost nothing to show for loading data and I’ve even given him pandas and the CSV files to convert and he has no idea what he’s doing.

I’m about ready to rip him a new asshole in our next session but that will essentially have burned him as a project partner.

It’s painfully clear that he just doesn’t know how to do more than very basic python programing, it doesn’t seem like it’s important to him to spend time studying and the GitHub training that I’ve done for him seems to just be waste of time.

So I will then have to do this all by myself but it is infuriating to have to do all of this work and then have him do essentially nothing and get equal credit.

Sorry for the rant but this is infuriating having him waltz into meetings all friendly and having ignored our work yet again all week. If I was strong enough to pick it up I want to hurl my chair at his stupid lazy face.

business,I made a business at my school,"At my school you can more often than not bet that you will do nothing in the classroom other than play with your Chromebook for an entire hour or more. This leads to many students trying to play games or watch movies, but with it being a school most sites are blocked and so students just sleep. 

I brought a pillow to school with me one day, it was meant for me. But the second I whipped that bad boy out I turned heads from all around the classroom immediately. And all I could think was ""**Profit.""** 

I told my classmates, **""You can rent the pillow for $5 an hour.""** Instantly, almost as if instinctively, two classmates pulled their wallets from their pockets and threw their money at me. Luckily I had the next class with the one of the students so I rented him the pillow in that class.

So a few ideas floated around in my mind, ""**I could make this a trend.""**

You see...a while back my school had an Instagram and Snapchat account (student ran) where kids  would get a photo taken of them sleeping and post it to the account. Calling it ""\*school name\* sleeps."" Soon enough it became a competition to see who could make the funniest sleeps picture.

But now I'm stuck in a corner... I have so many ideas and a good amount of money for startup, *but what is going to keep students renting from me rather than bringing their own pillow.* This is the question that is currently keeping my trend from sailing.

**I thought up a few things:**

* Make a website and call it PillowHomie (considering I only need to make it a trend, something like a website specifically geared towards this would instantly get people talking.)
* Get a feather pillows and regular pillows. Rent the feather pillows for $8 as a premium option and the regular pillows for $5.
* Make a subscription based service where a student can rent a heated pillow for the week for $15
* Make sure all the pillows are perfectly fragranced, fluffed, and washed each day so that my pillows are more appealing than anyone elses.
* Pay (or hopefully) just ask some of the more popular students to promote this new trend on their social media.
* Have every sell come with a complementary item like gum.

This idea will go no where if I can't separate myself from the masses of students who could just bring their own pillow. Help me make PillowHomie real.",finance,1668486511

33. Everyone who saw the “Day in the Life of a Meta PM” video comes away shocked at the -20% dive after the earnings report. Was the culprit rooftop avocado toast and lattes, the $3.9 billion lost on the metaverse, or the (currently) ill-fated stock buy back? Time will tell. (Oct 27).

60. Apparently, Twitter has a program called Birdwatch that could be used to add “readers notes” to misleading tweets about Cardano.

76. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

CryptoCurrency,DOT Staking is pretty smooth now.,"First off: This is just an anecdote, take it as a shill or don't. Regardless, DYOR.

I've been DCAing into DOT for about a year now, on Kraken due to the staking it provided. With the recent debacles, it was time to move to cold storage (Ledger Nano X, for those wondering). Cue the new [Polkadot Staking Dashboard](https://staking.polkadot.network/#/overview). I'd been looking at both the new dashboard and [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/), and both seemed very attractive. Tutorials were quick and easy, and between the two Talisman actually seemed a bit easier. I had some misgivings about both after reflecting on all of the prior issues with Metamask, and ultimately decided on giving the official staking dashboard a go.

Man was I impressed. The dashboard UI is gorgeous, it is [easy to stake](https://polkadot.network/staking/), shows your rewards in realtime, and shows a great overview of available pools and validators. The ""pros"" are all pretty much in the camp of providing a clean user experience, and being robust. Miles better than going through Polkadot.JS was a year ago, which drove me to stay on CEX for staking in the first place.

Now, I won't say it's all perfect. Doing the initial setup with Polkadot.JS was still a pain in the ass when I first did it last year, and although I haven't done it recently with a new wallet, I can't imagine it's a whole lot better. In this instance, Talisman was far superior for quick setup with my hard wallet. Also, the Staking Dashboard incorrectly calculated the amount of Polkadot I could stake twice in a row, causing failed transactions. It wasn't until I subtracted 0.05 DOT from the recommended staking amount, that I was able to successfully bond to the pool. On top of that, picking a pool was a bit shady because a lot of pools AND validators have crazy buzzword language that are not very attractive to an informed investor. It looks like a Tiktok feed.

THAT ALL SAID, the experience as a whole was nigh-seamless and very straightforward. It's awesome having an easy place to navigate and see the pool and validator activity. The developers clearly know what is valuable information and how to present it.

So my point being - if you are nervous about staking with a cold wallet natively on Polkadot, don't be! CEXs are no longer required for ""easy"" DOT staking, and you should seriously consider the new dashboard, or at least Talisman (which is still an awesome alternative, and arguably easier!).

Update 4-11-2022

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

UPDATE 29-10-2022

As Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

I use Ally, and make $120 a month in interest on my savings account, but I've noticed CD rates are in the 3-4% range right now.

Is it more advantageous to keep it in savings and let it grow, retaining my money's flexibility, or should I give a CD a try and lock in for a higher interest rate?

personalfinance,keep or sell my rental home?,"Hello,  I own a home in my hometown but I relocated for work over a year ago, and I have been renting it ever since. This arrangement has been working fine for me and I am making a little extra money each month from the rent payment, however I do still have a mortgage on the property. I am renting where I live currently, kinda waiting to see if interest rates improve before I buy another property. Also there is very little inventory on the market currently in this area and its just difficult to even get offers accepted unless you're offering cash and above listing price so that has made it difficult for me to buy another property as well. However I'm wondering if I should just sell my rental house. 

I am in Michigan so that is why these numbers may seem low to people in CA or large cities. I owe 90k on the house and although I haven't had it appraised, based on prices of nearby properties I believe I could get something in the range of 170-190k for it so therefore I expect to make anywhere from 80k-100k if I sell. I'm not sure if the house is worth more to me as a rental and source of passive income or if I should just take the money and move on. All this time I've felt like it was better to just rent it and let equity build, but in September my tenant did not pay. They caught up on the rent in October and are currently up to date. But missing a month stressed me out because I was thinking i would have to evict them and I don't want to deal with possible months of not receiving rent. Also I am wondering if I would be a fool to not sell in this market if the market crashes in the future and I can't turn a profit on the house ever again.

Another reason I have been reluctant to sell is because I don't own any other real estate and I am  using this house as a retirement plan of sorts... I figure if I rent it out and pay it off I can always live in it later in life when I am ready to stop working and need a place to live without expensive rent or mortgage payments.",finance,1668520492
bonds,I Bonds Compounding,"Hi everyone, noobie question here. I bought an I Bond around May of this year at the 9.62% interest rate. On my TreasuryDirect account it only shows the interest I've accrued minus the three months it doesn't show me because I've held the bond for less than a year. 

My question is, I see that they compound the interest after 6 months. Would I see my bond value going from 10,000 to 10,236 (what I'm seeing now on treasury direct), or to ~10,500 based on all interest that's accrued, even the interest I can't see because it's hidden.

stocks,Current Correlation between US Stocks and Foreign Currencies,"I have been keeping track of all commodities, stocks and currencies for a while and I have noticed a strange correlation that I'm unable to explain to myself. Every time the stocks go up, there seems to be a weakening dollar move against most major foreign currencies (mostly noticing EURO, GBP, and CAD). 

There was a slight move up this morning (around the time or posting) for the USD against others while the SPY dropped two dollars from 402 to 400. A very insignificant change if you ask me but it still baffles me how that correlation exists caused by even the smallest movements on the indexes... Could that possibly be algorithmic behaviour? Still, I can't get the reason behind it. 

Now when the FEDs actually hike the interest rates, I can understand the movements between the currencies... But how come the stocks get to have that effect as well? How long has this been happening for? And what are the reasons?

Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said at an investment conference Tuesday. If the ad market doesn’t improve next year, “it’s going to be hard” to hit the company’s $12 billion earnings forecast for 2023, Zaslav said at RBC’s Global TIMT Conference in New York. Zaslav’s comments signal a change in rhetoric from large traditional media executives who generally said this summer that advertising slumps weren’t significant for them even as digital media players saw a pullback. Advertisers have reduced spending as the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates to cool inflation, pressuring equities including media companies’.

Things got “a lot worse” during the past few months, Zaslav said. Warner Bros. Discovery has had its valuation cut in half this year. Other companies reliant on advertising, such as Snap, Meta and BuzzFeed, have all fallen more than 65% this year. Merging Discovery with WarnerMedia earlier this year has brought a series of unforeseen challenges because some assets were “unexpectedly worse than we thought,” Zaslav said. HBO went from making more than $2 billion in 2019 to losing about $3 billion last year as content spending surged, according to Zaslav. The CEO has changed course for HBO Max as it gets set to merge with Discovery+ next year, including eliminating low-rated shows and bigger budget movies made only for the streaming service.",finance,1668527557

CryptoCurrency,Banking giants and New York Fed start 12-week digital dollar pilot,"Recent announcement earlier today that Citi, HSBC, Mastercard, and Wells Fargo are participating in a 12-week digital dollar pilot with the Federal Reserve Bank of NY.  


Despite all the recent news / fallout of FTX, it is clear that institutions are exploring crypto for its actual use cases and looking to leverage the blockchain technology to add value to the financial ecosystem. The payments space has always been identified as an area that can use technological improvement, with countless middlemen and manual controls that significantly slow down the movement of money (e.g., cross-border payments taking days and going through several intermediaries).

It'll be fascinating to see the findings of the test pilot and what the various participants learned from it. Glad to see the U.S. taking a more active role in exploring blockchain technology in the payments space! Curious to hear other people's thoughts on the pilot though.

personalfinance,mortgage or retirement?,"So I unfortunately had to move/ buy a new home this summer, which meant a 5.85% interest rate. We owe around 288k on the house and our only other debt is student loans (both working toward PSLF however, not looking for advice on that front). We are behind in our retirement savings however but both are expecting a pension that is 65% of last salary in about 20 years. The monthly interest and principle payment is about 1700 on the house. I think we can spare another 250/m toward the mortgage or retirement but not both. 

My thought is I want to pay down as much of the mortgage as possible so that in the event rates fall (I'm thinking YEARS from now) we can refinance to a 15 year mortgage with out upping our payment. And in the event that rates don't fall, well we're still paying it off early, which is nice. I know typically the market performs better than my mortgage rate (over time), but I feel like the interest rate is so high we might be better off going for the sure thing.

For some reason, I think that paying extra towards the principal early in the life of the loan would be more valuable because the interest is based on the outstanding value of the loan's remaining principal, and cutting that down early should reap larger benefits.

robotics,"A take I haven't seen on ""Why the emphasis on humanoid robots over purpose built bots?""","Wrote an effortpost response to a question I've seen multiple times in many forms. Also serves as a response to people straightforwardly arguing against the concept of a humanoid robot being practical ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk1oClYJE58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wk1oClYJE58)). Posting it here as its own post because I'd love to hear other people's opinion.

TL;DR for long post: We do engineer simpler purpose built ones and will continue to, but there is a big conceptual reason to focus discussion on humanoid robots (it's a legible and essentially inarguable milestone), and a huge practical and economic advantage in actually developing such bots (learning from human execution of tasks and then replacing them 1:1 allows for extremely rapid deployment at massive scale).

For one, there already exist and will continue to exist a huge number of non-humanoid robot form factors that are designed with specific use cases in mind. No sensible developer thinks that a factory of humanoid robots will replace industrial manufacturing robots or that it's better to have a humanoid robot try to crawl through pipes in a collapsed building when a smaller exploratory bot would do better.

That said, every time (counted in the dozens) I've seen people try to advance the position of  ""humanoid robots are a silly sci-fi preoccupation"" and then have people respond to it, I've never seen the two responses that I think are the strongest. First, it's just a very legible milestone. Humans are meat puppets, and society as it exists is built on humans doing labor. For the physical element of that labor in many areas, automation and robotics have replaced human work by being more productive for less cost in significant amounts. But this replacement is far from total; billions of peoples' livelihood still comes in large part from the physical labor they perform. When we actually achieve a human-equivalent robotic form factor (simple visual: the robots as depicted in the Will Smith I Robot movie), it will represent a comprehensible milestone on what is actually a gradual shift in replacing human labor with cheaper and more efficient robotic labor. Millions, if not billions, of human jobs will have been replaced prior to the day that robot is released, and it will be some amount of time before production of robots will scale to the point that all physical labor jobs will be replaced. But once that human-equivalent robot is realized, at whatever cost, it's essentially proof that human labor is obsolete. Those bots will get cheaper, and faster, and stronger, and more capable in ways that humans will never be able to compete with.

The second point I have never seen is that humanoid robots have a massive advantage over custom designed bots (in many use cases) that goes far beyond the usual (strong and valid) argument of ""we live in a world designed for humans and bipedal, human-sized robots can navigate it better."" That advantage is training data. Development of robots is difficult and expensive, but it's often the programming of their movements/tasks that becomes the most complicated element of deploying them as useful labor. Think all the videos of industrial robot arms failing to make a hamburger or latte. 

Now imagine McDonalds or Starbucks installing cameras in a number of their locations to capture how their existing human employees perform their jobs (with or without mocap dots on their uniforms, depending on how computer vision advances over the next few years). Plugging that motion data into machine learning models would then be able to directly provide task-specific programming to a humanoid bot. Once we have a human-equivalent bot it becomes a platform for multi-purpose use. Every human doing a job, from construction worker to organic farmer to vehicle repair to in-home nurse flipping their patient to soldier, becomes training data to teach that bot how to replace them. Intelligent humans with economic incentive, and a history of predecessors to learn from who also had creativity and incentive, are likely to have developed and converged on efficient ways to accomplish most tasks. Someone who's spent years flipping burgers or laying bricks is way more likely to have developed the optimal technique than an engineer trying to design movements with no actual experience. A training set built from thousands of experienced people is even more likely to find optimal execution. The more repetitive the job, the faster and easier a job can be digested by ML, but with enough data and compute, everything is theoretically on the chopping block.

Think of the cost savings of being able to replace every human being working in a designed-to-be-staffed-by-humans workplace with a mass-manufactured bot, rather than having to design and rebuild every restaurant, mechanic shop, dentist office, etc etc etc. And once a job is trained, analyzed and ""solved,"" then every single bot can perform that job. No more training replacement employees or new ones at a new location. And for edge case AI failures, a human ""pilot"" could take over remotely using VR/mocap. Their human solution to the failure would then become part of the training set to avoid that failure ever again.

Yes, a top down burger joint designed to be run by custom bots could probably achieve some theoretical efficiency gains. But would those gains justify the cost to develop and rebuild every McDs, or is it sufficient to just slot bots into existing locations? Whoever develops the human-equivalent robotic platform that can even do 85% of what a human can do (let alone the eventual 99% or 105% or 300% productivity that mechanical humanoids will likely achieve over meat puppets) could be the most profitable ""single product"" ever launched. If it comes to market sufficiently developed, with a sizable enough lead on competition, etc, it could become the fastest consolidation of power (economic and otherwise) in history. A lot of ifs/coulds, but enough huge potential gains that it makes absolute sense to chase.

I wouldn't be super surprised if someone has counterpoints to this, as that might explain why I haven't seen this angle expressed before. I've paid attention to this subject for a long time, read books and probably hundreds of articles on robotics, the economics of automation and the nature of labor, and this frame has been absent from all of them. I am quite sure I'm not the only one to think of it this way, so I am eager to see if others have encountered the ""humans as training data"" perspective.",technology,1668535946

personalfinance,Confused with my Car Loan payments/interest. Could someone explain?,"Okay so to make it short with as many details as possible. I recently got a car loan from my credit union, about $25000 with a 4.1%~ interest rate for 78 months. So after everything, it said I owed about $367~ minimum this month and on. I went ahead and put $400 yesterday (day before it was due), and I ended up seeing that it was only $310 put towards the actual car loan, and $90 in interest. So I was extremely confused and didn't add up right. 

So I contacted the CU, they stated ""when making the monthly payment, some will go towards the interest and the reset will go towards principal. Unless you were making a second payment where we could make a principle only payment"". Then proceeded to say that it's a day-to-day interest. My next payment will have interest, unless I'm doing an extra payment, the payment will stay the same.

So could someone explain to me better of how this works lol. I feel stupid and I'm trying to understand how that adds up. And what I can do to pay it off more, with lowering my interest in total. Should I just pay the exact amount each month, pay weekly, etc? I appreciate anyone who replies and thank you :)",finance,1668537894

personalfinance,Trying to figure out where to start,"I'm married, making $42k/y, with separate finances from my wife who's making $95k/y. Starting 2022, I was making solid progress in working myself out of about $10k in CC debt, with a $7k car loan, and $4k personal loan. She's an accountant, and my monthly allocation of the bills is scaled appropriately; she pays more than I do due to her larger income, leaving me roughly $1300/mo in household bills such as utilities and mortgage. 

My job requires a hefty commute and due to the nature of the road I have to take, I end up incurring large toll road fees in order to make it to work. Taking the non-toll road means I have about an hour and a half commute one-way/3 hours a day; toll road shortens that to 45min one way/hour and a half a day. Gas is also a major expense for me, but my wife works from home.

In May, after looking for a while, I found a new job very close to home; about a 5min commute. I was bait and switched after signing on and ended up making only $40k/y, as opposed to the $45k/y I was promised. The entire job was nothing like advertised; went from working 40hr weeks to 100hr weeks, owners were toxic, and it all around was a horrible time in my life. I stuck around for as long as I could though because without the commute and with no time off, I was socking away decent income and paying down more debt when I could.

I left my prior job on good terms though, and managed to quit the new job and get back into my old one at the same rate; basically as if I never left. Problem is, there was a gap between my quitting and my getting rehired, and a few other costly things happened in that interim, causing me to have to dip into the credit cards once again. 

My credit rating took a 60 point drop. With inflation, I'm spending a lot more in general, and interest rates have gone up on most of my debts. I went from about $10k in CC debt to $28k now. Basically, I'm just paying out a LOT more in general, and barely able to make ends meet. My wife is helpful to be sure, but I don't know where to begin on paring things back so I can make solid progress again. I've frozen all my credit cards, but interest is eating much of my payments. I've managed to get my personal loan down to $2.7k from $4k, and my car loan is down to $5k. I've contacted my credit union to try to refinance my car loan from 6.15% to their 5.75% rate @ 72 months, which would drop my monthly car payment by $120.

I've calculated everything, and I take home around $2600/mo, but pay out $3300/mo. And this is just spending what I have to to survive. I end up making up for the shortfall by either selling things online when I can, or literally paying my credit card bill to use the card to pay another bill. Fully $300 of that per month is gas expenses, another $400 in toll lane usage, so $700 a month just to get to work.

However I have 9 credit cards, one is paid off, one is a Care Credit card, so 0% interest, one with my credit union at 10%, but the other 6 are 20-23% interest. And that's killing me.

So, other than refinancing my car loan, where do I begin? Should I take a lower interest loan to consolidate the credit cards? The job market isn't the best right now, so moving to another job isn't the best option. I'm trying to reduce my usage of the toll lanes to reduce that expense but it's literally trading off for time. I'm also trying to work with my boss to see if he can either give a raise or help subsidise my travel expenses or both.

My goal is to minimize the debt to a more manageable value, so I can begin to have savings again. I have nothing in a savings account, nothing in a 401k, and what stocks I had I sold before they tanked, so my portfolio is very slim right now. 

So...sorry for the long read, but what is everyone's thoughts on where to begin?",finance,1668541577

personalfinance,Is an ARM worth considering over a FRM?,"So long story short im looking at potentially getting a lot in a few years to put a home on to live. Heard some good options from the local bank but my entire concern now is over the adjustable rate.  


I have no experience with financing this sort of stuff and wanted some advice on what I should look out for. I talked to my bank and they offer a 30 year loan at 20% down along with some other minor requirements however the catch is its an ARM that they said can only adjust up to a max of 2% per year after the first 3.  


Did some rough math and I am still within my budget if it were to change a couple points depending on where it starts. However the thing I am worried about is, is it possible for the interest rate to go up and up with no end in sight? My biggest fear in this scenario is every year after the first 3 is its just maxed at 2% increases every year without stabilizing or going down.  


Still plan to ask some other local banking/credit union options if they might offer a FRM for the same project but no idea if they will all turn up as ARM because its not a usual home situation.",finance,1668551904
CryptoCurrency,Stablecoins have never been safer,"When interest rates are 0% and you are a company that holds custody of US dollars, you may consider taking some level of risk in order to gain some profit. And there's little risk-free cash flow to offset eventual losses, creating a risky situation for stablecoin issuers.

Right now we have over 4% interest rates in T-bills. Tether at a $66b valuation can do absolutely nothing, take 0 risks and bring in almost $3 billion in profits every year. If they only have 43 employees linked in their LinkedIn, $3B is $69 million in profit per employee. Or it can be used to cover losses they may have had in other investments. And with a little strategy, they can lock the profitability for years to come with a good blend of different short, medium, and long-term bonds.

That's not counting arbitrage they may make if the coin dips, profit from the creation and redemption of tokens, etc. They may still go bankrupt if they're colossally stupid, but it's clear that Tether, Circle, Paxos, etc. are playing in easy mode for now.",cryptocurrency,1668552125
investing,Question about long-duration CD interest rates,"I would love to know more definitive information about how long-duration CDs are priced. I understand that the Fed overnight rate controls much at the short-end of the yield curve (and the ""prime rate""), and that the long-end of the yield curve (such as for long-duration bonds and mortgage rates) is guided at least as much by inflation expectations and real rate expectations. But what about long-duration CDs?

10-year Bond yields have fallen substantially over the last week due to CPI and PPI data, but the Fed claims they will continue to raise the overnight rate a little higher. Is now the best time to get in on 5-10 year CDs, or should I wait? 

A somewhat related question to anyone with experience re-selling Broker CDs: how bad is the spread when you try to re-sell these, and how high in value do they go in times of war / recession / lockdown / etc.? I know that bonds tend to surge in price, with corresponding falling yields, in uncertain times, which is why they tend to balance a stock profile well. Do long-duration CDs offer a similar benefit? Does anyone have experience doing this? 

Thanks to all.",finance,1668552628

personalfinance,How to afford dental treatment,"Hi everyone, I would appreciate any advice/suggestions. My husband needs crowns on several teeth and we were quoted a price of about $6000 at two different dental clinics. This is despite having dental insurance (Humana HMO prepaid plan). We were told by one clinic that we could get financing through care credit which would give us 24 months interest free to repay. We applied and although we did get the financing offer, the interest rate is 26% and there is no mention of a no interest period. My credit score is good- in the 800s. I work for the government and make 4100 per month after taxes. My husband is still looking for work as we recently moved to a new city. He is starting to have tooth pain and so we really need to have the treatment done but we cannot afford $6000 and I don’t want to get us into a spiral of debt with a 26% interest rate. This is all especially discouraging as I thought the entire point of dental insurance was to avoid having these situations. Any advice would be extremely appreciated.",finance,1668554272
investing,Is the fed rate the only thing that determines savings and cd rates?,"I've notice as the fed raises its interest rate,  cds and savings rates are also raising at a similar level.

Or is there a chance Banks will start to lower their rates even if the fed rate stays constant?",finance,1668556644

CryptoCurrency,New York Fed announces test of digital dollar with major banks,,cryptocurrency,1668573625
CryptoCurrency,How cbdc will be adopted by beginners and boomers:,"With the news about the new fed coin in NY I can’t help but think the fall of FTX was the perfect scapegoat to introduce a centralized coin from the banks. They just happened  to have some code laying around and ready to go? Ok lol.

Anyways, how will big banks bring on crypto users? They are not. They want people who don’t understand and will trust government/banks over a CEX. How will they achieve it?

1. Big banks will offer 10% apy beating inflation and most people unaware of the cons of centralization will fomo in.
2. Perhaps it will be piched as an alternative saving account with FDIC insurance on the new IOU Fed coin.
3. Banks to compete with each other will offer a differential rate such as 10.5% with “us” when you open a new account driving revenue up for them and doing exactly what ftx did.
4. REMITTANCE, cost of using a cbdc with lower fees and same day settlement vs outdated option like western union, I think immigrants who are not the most tech savy might find it easier to send money over seas straight from their banking app. There are fintech apps such like WISE: remitly, moneygram, and paypal that prove there is room in this space.

\*On a side note maybe starting a short postion on western union is looking kind of good if all this plays out. lol dyor

Idk shit about fuck but this sounds logical to me, what yall think?

btc,"When the function breaks, it's GAME OVER (Implosion Theory)","""The exchanges are owned by somebody. It's not a free open space. It's owned by somebody. Usually one person. The Russell 500 is a privately owned entity by a family. The NASDAQ is an owned market. One family owns the Toronto Stock exchange and London Stock Exchange. 

In the crypto space the problem is is that SBF is going to be seen as worse than Bernie Madoff, the mechanisms that these exchanges use to get you to purchase whatever it is that they were selling with your money, your fiat dollars, right? 

Because at the end of the day what's worth more right now? 48b in usd or 48b in X token? Which would you rather have?

You're gonna take the 48b. You'd be silly not to. When you look at the strength of the economic system, that's what it operates on right now.

The point is, it's the money. If they were selling tokens for dollars, that's the whole point. 

With FTX in order to sell these securities, because that's what they were deemed as, they had to have money in the bank. They didn't actually have money in the bank.

That's the problem. This is a microcosm of the bigger economic system.

99% of the projects are going to fail. Going to $0. After SBF/FTX it's going to be Tether. Once they find out what tether is all about that's going to blow the roof off of it all and BTC is going to plummet.

What's the point of doing this at the end of the day? To make money.

Why is SBF in this position? Why did he do what he did? 

Because if you're truly about being progressive and being a leader in society you're in charge of ""leading the industry"" and instead he ends up defrauding a lot of people, he plays a game of musical chairs that's basically a ponzi scheme, and he got caught.

The best part is is when they figure out that his influxes of cash came through Tether and that USDT is based on nothing, then a lot of people are going to be quite upset.

You have to understand how these exchanges in certain places, how they hold the money. 

This is the whole scam: you deposit $1K of USD on an exchange, and they give you credit on the exchange. And as soon as that happens, whatever numbers they show you - it doesn't matter. 

They can say you have $1K USD and then you go to transfer it into BTC, then exchange it into another coin, then another. 

All of that is a game. It doesn't matter. It's a well known scam.

The trick with this scam is, can you get your money out.

At some point when that function breaks, that's when it's game over. 

The system is this: you're entering a house. The key is that first door. Getting in is very easy. They take your money, easy, you get inside the house. And there are all your tokens. Convert your tokens here and there, high-yield interest rates here and there, it's all a smoke and mirrors show. 

It's when you want to exit, that's the issue.

What ends up happening is, as long as they are pulling in more revenue (which is the Ponzi scheme part), the more revenue they can dish out. 

That's what makes it look like a functional business.

The point is to turn a profit. As FTX got more and more money it started buying marketing rights here, put name here and there, work with Tom Brady etc. 

When that happens, the money flows in, some will flow out but ultimately most of it is to be converted into some token, into something, whether that token, has a name or is a number on the screen with very hard loopholes to get out of.

That's the problem. When these exchanges become insolvent is when they stop paying out. And when they stop paying out the money is somewhere else. 

It's gone. 

It becomes a supply and demand game. Part of the scam is, if you form a company and you offer those tokens and those securities do you ever actually hold the coin? No.

Unless you have a third party place to hold the actual cryptos. 

The problem is taking it out.

Binance has grown and grown and when they reach whatever amount they want to reach. If say it's worth 500 billion dollars, that means you probably have at least 10% sitting in cash. So then, you got $50b in cash, they could easily just cash out, shut down the operation, no one else cashes out. You get sued, if you get good lawyers maybe you'll pay $20b in cash, do seven years of time, then you'll get out with $30b after. And there's your heist. 

That's the tricky part is when these ""experts"" are turning out to be frauds. And the people with some economic sense have been looking at this like, it's a matter of WHEN. Not IF. 99% of crypto. 

It's going to evolve into something much more different, much more regulated. It's going to be like the stock market and they will all be viewed as securities.""",cryptocurrency,1668576879

personalfinance,At an investing Crossroads,"Just recently I sold my house. My sole debt is a van (which has such a low interest rate it does not make sense to pay it off sooner when I could put that money to work somewhere else). The proceeds from the house are in excess of 100k and I'm at a Crossroads on what to do with it all.

I was stationed in Europe so I set aside a portion for travel and parked that in a high yield savings account. I have an emergency fund in the same place. 

I have 2 Roth IRAs that are maxed out for the year and are on an auto pay like any other bill. I also have 3 529s for my kids, but due to my job they also have access to my GI Bill when the time comes so I'm not dumping money into those. All these accounts are with Edward Jones (which I recently learned was about the worst when it comes to fees).

Here's my problem. The guy who runs my accounts at Edward Jones has always done a good job and it takes the burden and eases my mind when it comes to investing. I may not be making as much as I could doing it on my own, but I don't have to do it on my own. I've also never had the kind of money I have right now to invest. I've really only ever had enough to max my IRAs and toss a few bucks to the kids 529s.

I'd like to branch out but I'm not savvy enough to feel like I know that I'd do a good job. I don't need this money right now and want it to do work for me but if it's not stupid simple I'll find myself posting here in reddit again and scouring message boards until I'm obsessed.

33. Everyone who saw the “Day in the Life of a Meta PM” video comes away shocked at the -20% dive after the earnings report.

60. Apparently, Twitter has a program called Birdwatch that could be used to add “readers notes” to misleading tweets about Cardano.

In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

# Methodology

When the authors initially wrote this thesis, the intention was not to take the position of an expert in company valuation. Instead, their aim was to investigate the development of a company based upon information and knowledge obtained from previous education and studies. Moreover, the underlying company for this valuation is Intel Corporation, since the authors aim to analyse a well reputable company with a strong market brand in a highly competitive market.

&amp;#x200B;

# Secondary Data

Secondary data is the information that doesn’t require a direct collection or studies, this information is publicly available online for the public to be consulted. Meanwhile, primary data are information that has to be collected by direct means such as interviews, measurements or polls. In this paper, only secondary data and data derived from it are used. Following the main data related to the company that are mainly used for the evaluation models:

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|**Levered Beta**|**0.73**|
|**Unlevered Beta**|**0.57**|
|**CAPM**|**7.01%**|
|**WACC**|**6.25%**|
|**ROE**|**25.50%**|
|**EPS**|**4.66**|
|**P/E**|**5.65**|
|**PEG ratio**|**4.43**|
|Corp Tax|8.46%|
|**Growth Rate Estimate**|**18.26%**|
|Growth Rate Estimate with market risk|12.68%|
|Analyst growth estimate|\-3.60%|
|Next 5y Analysts growth|\-20.92%|
|Intel’s Corporate Bonds|4.77%|
|Outstanding Shares|4,127,000,000|
|Earnings distributed|28.41%|
|Earnings retained|71.59%|

note: EPS is the EPS of last month, this is to compare the company in that time period to today's macro data.

# Macro Economic Data

|Data|Number|
|:-|:-|
|Market Expected Return|9.40%|
|Risk Free Rate|4.21%|
|Risk Premium|5.19%|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31%|
|Average US GDP Growth|3.18%|
|Current Market P/E|18.58|

# Evaluation Methods

In this paper, five evaluation methods are used to evaluate the company's final fair value. Each method gives us different current fair values for a single share of the company. The final price tag is determined by the average price between all the methods used.

## Growth Rate

**The Growth Rate of 18.26%** is calculated taking in count the previous year earnings of 19.86 Billion, the retained percentage of the earnings that were not distributed of 71.59% and its historical ROE calculated by the average ROE of the last 4 years of 25.50%. The final Growth Rate is f **12.68%**, this number is found by subtracting risk premium from the growth rate. This is done as a precaution and reduction of overestimations.

## Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model

This simple model takes in mind the company 2021 Free Cash Flow of $9.66 billion, its WACC based discounted rate of 6.25% and its Growth Rate of 12.68% to determine a fair value of **$41.05** per share.

## Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula

This model is used in the Value Investing communities to price tag a company based on its intrinsic value. This formula is created by Benjamin Graham, a value investor and professor at Columbia University who is considered the father of Value Investing.

**Intrinsic value = EPS × \[(8.5 + (2 × Expected annual growth rate, g)\]**

Which 8.5 is the P/E base of a no-growth company, and the expected growth rate is the company perpetual growth rate for the future.

In 1974, in the revised edition of **The Intelligent Investor**, Graham revised the formula to

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (8.5 + 2\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

In this formula, 4.4 is the then prevailing (1962) rate on high-grade corporate bonds listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Y is the current yield on AAA-rated corporate bonds.

Graham thought that as the investor had the choice between putting money in common stocks or bonds, it was appropriate to take into account the rate of interest paid on a high-grade bond of 4.4 per cent in determining the intrinsic value of a stock.

In this thesis we use an adjusted formula

**Intrinsic value = \[EPS × (7 + 1\*g) × 4.4\]/Y**

The P/E of 7 is used because even if a company has zero growth prospects, but it is able to maintain cash flows and distribute dividends, its P/E is generally higher than 8.5.

The used growth rate is the one calculated.

The '2' multiplier is too aggressive. Graham never experienced companies with growth rates of 15-25 per cent, which is common today. Instead of '2', here it is used 1 instead.

The interest rate of 4.4 is left as the original, some modern adjustment put this value at 8.5, which is the five-year fixed deposit rate. This value is the substitute of the risk-free rate, which sometimes can be used instead of 4.4.

Data used for the calculation:

|EPS|4.66|
|:-|:-|
|Growth Rate|12.68|
|AAA Bond Yield|5.31|

The Adjusted Graham Intrinsic Value Formula gives us a price tag of **$75.98**

&amp;#x200B;

## Discounted Unlevered Free Cash Flow Model

A modified version of the traditional Discounted Cash Flow. This model instead of using the free cash flow, uses the unlevered one.

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF, also known as Free cash Flow to the Firm) is **the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations**. Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures. It is used to remove the impact of capital structure on a firm's value and to make companies more comparable

In simple words. It is the cash flow of a company based on the belief that the company owes no debt, therefore has no interest payments to make.

In this model, it is taken in mind the following data:

|WACC based discount rate|6.25%|
|:-|:-|
|Growth rate|12.68%|
|Average US GDP growth rate|3.18%|
|rage Shares outstanding|4,127,000,000|

This gives us a fair value of **$46.50**

&amp;#x200B;

## Final Fair Value

The Final price tag is determined as per following:

|Free Cash Flow Evaluation Model|**$41.05**|
|:-|:-|
|Adjusted Graham Fair Value Formula|**$75.98**|
|Discounted Unleveread Free Cash Flow Model|**$46.50**|
|**Final Fair Price (Average)**|**$32.71**|

Note:  In the evaluation, the price took in  mind discounted dividends model and total payout model, which both give  an evaluation of $0 due to the fact that growth rate is higher than the  discount rate. So the average takes in count the three methods above plus the two zeros

The company pays dividends so in this case i priced in also the output of those two models too

# Main Competitors

Intel Corporation is in the Semiconductor’s sector.

As the only leading-edge U.S. semiconductor company that **both develops and manufactures its own technology**, Intel has a widespread economic impact in every sector of the U.S. economy and a strategic advantage over its competitors. It is also the largest publicly traded semiconductor chipmaker in the United States.

The company is responsible for creating the x86 microprocessor, which is a part of nearly all personal computers today.

Despite being a leader in its market, Intel operates in an area that has many players that compete for market share. Below are some of Intel's main competitors.

|AMD - Advanced Micro Devices, like Intel, produces more than just microprocessors. Both companies create motherboards, servers, and other computer-related hardware. In terms of the x86 microprocessor, **AMD is Intel's biggest competitor.** Intel and AMD are rivals, much like Apple and Microsoft. They have certain specifications and dedicated users that will always stick to one over the other. Products from both companies are similar in price and quality. Though Intel's chips are primarily found in the computers of large companies, the competition between Intel and AMD comes down to individuals that build their own computers.|
|:-|
|IBM - International Business Machines is one of the first computer companies in the world, Founded in 1911, it was the pioneer in computer technology during the 20th century. The company developed the ATM, the hard disk, the floppy disk, the magnetic stripe, and many more. It is one of the 30 companies on the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and one of the largest employers in the world. IBM used to produce computers using Intel's processors, but has since sold off that business and is now **selling its own servers and mainframes using its own processors, putting itself directly in competition with Intel.** The company launched a program to open source much of its architecture and firmware back in 2013, which attracted many new customers to using its Central Processing Units, stealing market share from Intel.|
|NVIDIA - NVIDIA is one of the key players in the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. It is one of the **biggest names in video games**. It also designs **chips for mobile phones and automobiles**. Many of its chips are used in supercomputers, and it is now working on artificial intelligence. Intel released a new graphics card in the second half of 2021 that is competing directly with Nvidia's dominance in that field. It is used to compete in areas of data centre, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.|
|Samsung - In 2018, it surpassed Intel as the largest semiconductor maker by revenue, but in 2019, Intel took that spot back. It's clear that both companies strive against one another for the top spot. Intel and Samsung don't compete in all fields, however. **Intel's products primarily focus on desktops and laptops, whereas Samsung focuses on semiconductors for smartphones and data centres.**|

# The Products

|**CGC – Client Computing Group** includes products designed for end-user form factors, focusing on higher growth segments of 2-in-1, thin and-light, commercial and gaming, and growing other products such as connectivity and graphics|
|:-|
|**NEX – Network and Edge Group** includes programmable platforms and high-performance connectivity and compute solutions designed for market segments such as cloud networking, communications networks, retail, industrial, healthcare, and vision.|
|**DCAI – Datacenter and AI Group** includes a broad portfolio of CPUs, domain specific accelerators, FPGAs and memory, designed to empower datacenter and hyperscale solutions for diverse computing needs|
|**AXG – Accelerated Computing System Graphics Group** includes CPUs for high performance computing (HPC) and GPUs targeted for a range of workloads and platforms from gaming and content creation to HPC and AI in the data centre|
|**IFS – Intel Foundry Services** is a services provider offering a combination of leading-edge packaging and process technology, world-class differentiated internal IPs (i.e.: x86, graphics, AI), broad 3rd party ecosystem and silicon design support.|
|**Mobileye** includes the development and deployment of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies and solutions.|

# Financials

## Income Statement

In the past three years the average increase in revenue has gone up by 0.10% showing a stagnation of sales with the growth from 2020 to 2021 being 0.47%. While having an average increase in operating expense of 2.14% with the last year increase, from 2020 to 2021, of 10.12% showing a spike in costs for the last operating period.

It is expected for the year 2022 to have both Costs and Revenue increase by approximately 18%

A point of some concern might be the small decrease in net revenue in those past 4 years, confirming a stagnation of the business.

## Balance Sheet

The 2021 balance sheet shows us

* Short term debt of 4.59 Billion coverable by cash and cash equivalents plus account receivables, but not only by C&amp;C alone
* Long term debt is coverable by current assets alone
* Increased stockholders equity, earnings are being retained in the company and reinvested

## Cash Flows

Intel has positive Cash Flow from Operations in the last four years. Same thing for Net Cash Flow. A reduction of both can be observed for the last year.

The Company has an Income Quality ratio of 1.51, which is good and signals a healthy income.

INTC is investing heavily in PP&amp;E

# Revenue Forecast

With the release of the new Intel Arc 7, with has the potential and capability to rival and surpass its competitors, NVIDIA and AMD, and a increase in demand for the year 2023, it is forecasted a growth in revenue according to the growth rate calculated of 12.86%

## Analysts Price Target

**$72 High**

**$32.74 Average**

**$18 Low**

**$32.71 OP’s**

# Final Considerations

## What is its position compared to competitors?

By observing the industry and taking in count different factors such as geopolitical and market demands for electronics, we can forecast a possible development for Intel.

INTC has a strong customer base and it is known worldwide for its contributions and development of cutting hedge technologies, this is well resonated especially in developing countries such as India, China, Nigeria and Indonesia.

While its North American market share in Graphics and Motherboards got eroded by some percentage by its main competitor AMD, it still maintain a leadership position in the sector. We shall note that Intel operates in sectors which permit it to diversify a little bit its product’s portfolio, where AMD doesn’t have expertise nor is capable to compete.

With high inflation and interest rate corroding the whole market, it is expected to meet some possible downturn for the near period of time (3 to 6 months) and stabilise within a year while the FED is fighting the raising of costs. The company has strong fundamentals that shields it from possible adverse events in the near future and its cash flow quality is high.

Intel Corporation is currently undervalued due to North American Market downtrend perception of it due to the rival’s marketing attacks. It is also reasonable that the past CEO brought the company into stagnation and slowdown, but with the new one, with his expertise and experience, we can expect a turnaround and regain of some market share in the next few years.

With US Government subsidies for the semiconductor industry, we can see a deep strategic interest in bringing and boosting domestic productions and reducing potential risk from over relying on taiwanese manufacturers. This incentivised Intel to invest in two new fabs, one in Ohio and one in Arizona, plans to expand existing plants are already funded and another European production site is planned in Germany.

SWOT analysis shows us many strong moats for the business, which are its competitive advantages over competitors. Huge potentials can be exploited if the company decided to pursue an expansion strategy into developing countries and markets.

Lack of insiders sell, which the last one in february 2022, shows us that the management is confident in the company's future development, which is confirmed by additional buying from the CEO itself in the last months. Big Institutions and Mutual Funds hold portions of the company too, signalling strong sentimento towards the company. Employees rating and satisfaction rate is high, salaries aren't that much different from rivals.

## Is the company a Buy or a Sell?

The company is distributing regular dividends, it has strong fundamentals and lots of cash to meet adverse events. Institutions and insiders are holding. The current downtrend is due to market trend and social mechanism, of which contributed AMD marketing in damaging Intel’s perception in the CPU segment.

Fundamentally though, the company has many potentials and growth opportunities, especially now with its new release Intel Arc 7.

Intel is a smart investment for long term holders, not only because its intrinsic value is expected to grow, but also for the fact that it pays high dividend’s yield. If the company was in a severe situation, it still can retain earnings to cover expenses, even if it is unlikely due to its present liquidity.

The cooldown of infration migh suggest a better economic landscape for 2023

In the end, the verdict is one: **Buy. Fair Value is $32.71.**

**What are you thoughts? Is Intel a Buy or a Sell? Let us all know!**

With bond interest rates being high, particularly on longer dated ones, when the interest rates drop, their prices will disproportionately increase. Yes, you actually can get 20-80% upside from longer dated bonds, provided your broker let's you buy them and you used the many available calculators to estimate the risk benefits. 

As a test, you can punch in the numbers for the past month when rates on longer dated bonds have begun to come down and see how much of an increase you would have had.

business,SpaceX Said in Talks to Raise Money Above $150 Billion Value. SpaceX mulling secondary share sale at $150 billion valuation -sources - Reuters,"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/spacex-fundraising-talks-150-bln-valuation-bloomberg-news-2022-11-15/  
  
  
Nov 15 (Reuters) - Elon Musk’s rocket and satellite company SpaceX is in talks about an offering of mostly secondary shares that could value the company at up to $150 billion, representing a 20% increase in valuation, sources told Reuters.

The offering would be aimed at helping employees and shareholders cash out, two of the sources said. That view appears to contradict earlier information from a separate source that the offering would raise up to $1 billion for SpaceX via a new share issuance.

Talks with potential investors are centering around a price of $85 apiece for SpaceX shares, up from a split-adjusted $70 per share fetched earlier this year, sources said.  
  
  
The robust investor appetite contrasts with valuation cuts for many late-stage venture capital-backed startups due to sharp rises in interest rates and market volatility.

SpaceX, one of the world's most valuable private companies, has regularly provided liquidity programs for employees and early investors so they can sell their shares in the secondary market without the company going public.

The valuation is still fluid and any share sale plan, which requires SpaceX’s approval, could still change, the sources cautioned.",finance,1668600538

personalfinance,Pay 10% down and save cash for renovation or pay 15% and use credit card,"Currently in a process of buying a house (interest rate 6.125%)

Doing a 10% down but if I do 15% down then I can save around $145 in monthly mortgage payment

Basically I have to pay extra $23k to bump from 10% to 15%

But if I do the 15%, then I'm going to loose the money that I need to do some of the upgrades that I must do before I move in. (I have some emergency fund but I wont be touching them for upgrades)

I was thinking to use my credit card to do these upgrades (it will cost around $20K to do these upgrades) credit card APR is 19.99%. If I use my credit card, I will somehow pay it in 4-5 months.

Should I pay 15% down and then use my credit card to do the upgrades? or should just pay 10% down and use those remaining money for the upgrades without using credit card?

I'm not sure when I can refinance. May be in 1 year, 2 year. who knows. as long as I refinance, I will be paying $145 extra if I go with 10% down",finance,1668611154

personalfinance,Should we buy a house now or just wait it out? Here is our situation.,"We live in Ohio for reference. 

My husband just started his career as a software engineer. Starting pay is 60k a year and after taxes, retirement and medical, he brings home about 3,500 a month. I bring home about 2,000 a month. Right now we are pregnant with our first baby. We rent a small house with 2 bedrooms. The one bedroom is used for my husbands office since he works from home. We really want to upgrade but interest rates make monthly payments for a house insane. Currently we are saving my entire check towards, home, emergency fund, and baby. We also want to prepare to live solely off my husbands check once baby comes bc I plan to stay home. 

So we are living off of 3,500 a month which is pretty comfortable for us considering our rent is only $760 a month. Our utilities are also pretty cheap totaling about $250-300 a month. we do pay about $400 in student loans as well. 

When we think about upgrading to something bigger and paying twice as much, it freaks us out. We have always lived below our means and doubling our price in housing seems impossible 

We looked at a house for 180,000 and with interest rates and our 5% down payment it would be close to 1,500 a month for mortgage, insurance and property taxes. We could make it work but it seems SO expensive and we feel we would be house broke. We know at some point my husband will eventually make more money but still it’s hard to justify. We also worry about not being able to save enough. 

My biggest thing is, we could wait on buying a house but what happens if interest rates sky rocket even more and we end up paying even more in a year or two. 

Please give me some advice and what we should do. Thank you",finance,1668612120

stocks,Fed’s Daly sees rates rising at least another percentage point as ‘pausing is off the table’,"San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly said Wednesday she expects the central bank to raise interest rates at least another percentage point, and possibly more, before it can pause to evaluate how the inflation fight is going. Daly told CNBC in a live interview that her most recent estimate in the Fed’s summary of economic projections puts the benchmark overnight lending rate around 5%. She added that the right range is probably from 4.75% to 5.25% from its current targeted range of 3.75%-4%. “I still think of that as a reasonable landing place for us before we hold, and the holding part is really important,” she told Steve Liesman during the “Squawk on the Street” interview. “It’s a raise-to-hold strategy.” Thus far, the Fed has hiked the fed funds rate, which spills over into a slew of other consumer debt products, six times, including four consecutive 0.75 percentage point moves.

Daly said she sees a point where the Fed will be able to evaluate the impact of its hikes before moving higher, but that is not now. “Pausing is off the table right now. It’s not even part of the discussion,” she said. “Right now, the discussion is rightly around slowing the pace and ... focusing our attention really on what is the level of interest rates that will end up being sufficiently restrictive.”

$10k In a personal loan @ 18.99%

off as I use my credit cards for everything then pay it off almost immediately)


So a bit about me, I am single with no kids. Currently staying with friends so barely paying rent ($400/month). I took some time off of work to go back to school to work in a completely different field. But in my previous field that I have 11 years experience in, I make about $130k a year although since the mass exodus of people leaving the medical field I’m being offered a lot more than that. I’m currently looking for a entry level job in this new field but I’ll probably make around 80k to start(that’s on the low end). 

Now my question is, should I completely pay off this debt with this settlement check? I am definitely going to pay off the high interest $10k loan. But I’m wondering if I should pay off my car and student loans right away or pay them down faster by making large monthly payments and maybe invest some of this money in safe stocks or bonds.

Here is some information that is useful and how I calculated what I might be saving - looking to see if this is correct. 

* Total daycare cost for 2 children: $25,000.

* NJ married couple with an estimated AGI of ~$80,000 (64k + 42k - 25,900 = $80,100) putting us in the 12% tax bracket.

* DCFSA savings: 5,000 max for daycare expenses; $5,000 x 12% = $600 in federal income taxes, plus $5,000 x 7.65% FICA taxes = $382.50. $982.50 in taxes.

* Dependent Care Tax Credit: Max expenses in program is $16,000 for 2 kids. $16,000 (claiming the max as $25,000 - $5,000 = $20,000. I can only claim $16k of that) x 50% (It appears I can claim 50% due to our AGI) = $8,000 in credit.

It seems I should be taking advantage of both programs. Does this all look correct? Am I missing anything? Obviously these figures could change based on new limits in 2023 and if our income changes, but I feel as though we should be taking advantage of both as our daycare expenses are planning to increase again for 2023.

personalfinance,401k vs investing with taxable accounts when withdrawing early,"Hello, I have a question regarding tax-advantaged accounts (401k) vs taxable brokerage accounts when I am intending to withdraw early from 401k. Some background info: I am a 22 yo in California earning \~143k total before tax (base salary). The company is offering to match 100% for the first 6% of the base. Currently, I am maxing out my 401k and putting most of the remaining money into taxable accounts to invest in ETFs/Index. However, I am wondering how the 401k works when pulling money out early (\~10 years later) because I will not be in the states anymore and would be settling in a more LCOL country.

From what I read and using an online calculator, If I'm withdrawing 10 years later and assuming the employer match stays the same (100% for the first 6% base salary) and the rate of return stays at 6%, and an annual salary increase of 2%, the balance is \~371k when I'm 32. But if I take it out early, I get the 10% penalty + CA taxes (24% federal and 9.3% state), calculating, I get a net of \~192k.

But if I use the same amount that I would have maxed the 401k (assuming 18.5k/yr) according to the first calculator, and that money alone in 10 years (without investing) will be roughly the same as the one I get from 401k. Is my logic flawed? If not then I would consider investing it using a taxable account in ETFs instead.

* Hypothetically, if I buy 1-month T-Bills it takes 1 week of inactivity for that money to lose the interest difference between 3%/yr and 4%/yr (1/4 of a month). Is that a correct understanding? 
* Is it correct to assume that if you Transfer money from Savings to Brokerage say 7 Days before the Issue Date that your money is by default losing 1 Week of 4%/yr interest due to inactivity?

stocks,Recession indicator: U.S. shrinking container freight shows slipping consumer spending on merchandise,"LONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - Container freight volumes at the largest U.S. ports were down 3.8% in September compared with the same month a year earlier, confirming the slackening of merchandise trade and downturn in the business cycle.

The ports of New York-New Jersey, Los Angeles, Long Beach, Savannah, Houston, Norfolk, Charleston, Seattle and Oakland account for the overwhelming majority of container ocean freight into and out of the United States. The total volume of loaded containers handled by these nine ports amounted to 2.67 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEUs) in September 2022, down from 2.77 million in September 2021 and 2.85 million in September 2020.

The same slowdown was evident on the railroads, where the number of containers originated fell to 1.09 million in September 2022 from 1.14 million in September 2021 and 1.22 million in September 2020. Parcel delivery services have experienced an even steeper drop; FedEx reported U.S. deliveries were down by around 10% in the three months from June to August compared with a year earlier.

Chartbook: [**U.S. container trade**](https://tmsnrt.rs/3EC3xz1)

Freight is reflecting a significant slowdown in consumer spending on merchandise over the last 12-15 months as economies have re-opened after the pandemic and spending has rotated to travel and other services. Real consumer spending on merchandise in the three months from July to September 2022 was down by around 3.5% compared with the peak between April and June 2021, after adjusting for normal seasonal variations.

U.S. manufacturers reported barely any increase in activity in October, with the weakest reading in the Institute for Supply Management’s business survey since the pandemic and before that the mid-cycle slowdown in 2015/16.

The economies of the United Kingdom and the euro zone have already slipped into recession during the third quarter of 2022 and China’s manufacturing activity is contracting.

U.S. manufacturers and the rest of the economy is following the same trajectory, albeit the slowdown is likely to be shallower and shorter than in other regions which are more exposed to high energy prices and the conflict in Ukraine. 

As the global manufacturing sector contracts, freight volumes are likely to shrink further, which will eventually relieve some of the pressure on diesel fuel supplies.

Its crazy seeing how fast CEXs gained power in such a short time when initially decentralization and self governance was the entire purpose behind cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.

It also baffles my mind why anyone would use CeFi over DeFi when the latter clearly has so many benefits.

You don’t need verification. You have full custody. And even when you’re trading you have better options and leverage. Take Gains Network on Polygon for example. 125x on crypto and 1000x on Forex. You cant find numbers like these on CEXs. That and the fact that because these DeFi platforms are built on cheap L2s like the aforementioned Polygon, the fees are negligible.

And most importantly, you get FULL custody of your coins. We all saw what happened with FTX investors and Celsius investors as well.

These CeFi platforms are no different than a bank or any other financial institution. Yeah, they deal with crypto, but the central control is still there.",cryptocurrency,1668651441
personalfinance,"I just learned that health insurance is not federally required. As a healthy 33-year-old who is self-employed, should I just not get it?","Since the ACA was passed I figured health insurance was federally required. But the Supreme Court struck down that mandate. I'm in Minnesota which appears to not be one of the states that requires insurance. So, it seems I could go off insurance with no penalty.

I'm self-employed and so buy my own insurance (my wife and kids are insured through my wife's employer; it's expensive for the employee's spouse). As a healthy 33-year-old with no medical concerns I always get the cheapest possible plan. That means it has a massive deductible and so doesn't feel very beneficial.

It sounds like there would be two benefits to going off insurance:

- I would spend less per year. My premium for this bare-minimum insurance is $250 per month. It sounds like that's roughly the cost of one doctor visit if uninsured.

- I wouldn't be giving money to the insurance industry, with which I have huge ethical problems.

The risk of course is having to pay for some massive unforseen medical expense. However it sounds like the uninsured can negotiate massively lower bills than the insured.

personalfinance,"Wanting a Personal Loan, My Bank Has Decent Rates But Won't Approve the Amount. Finance Somewhere Else Then Refi?","Hey guys, this is probably stupid all in all, but I'm wanting to get a personal loan and can't get approved by my bank. Their rate is fixed 9%, I could be wrong but they do well on interest rates for other loans so I'm assuming this is a pretty decent rate. They won't approve me and gave a few reasons, it says frequent financing, length of credit history, mentions that I already have a title loan out with them and that I haven't been at my job long enough. Been at this job for about a year, and I'm not sure on the frequent financing part, maybe because I got a motorcycle loan about 7 months ago and I'm attempting to get another one? I have almost 3 years of credit history with a credit card but in terms of something bigger/specific just the motorcycle loan. I've had a different unsecured loan for a car years ago that I was always in good standing with but the way that place operated they didn't report to the credit bureaus.

&amp;#x200B;

My credit score is 716(Equifax and TransUnion, they always seem to trend lower than my FICO score) and the motorcycle loan out with them has been paid ahead since the beginning, I put in around five times the amount due every month. I've never missed a payment on anything in my life. I also have a small amount of debt on a credit card. My debt to income ratio isn't screwed and on paper and off I can afford this loan. I realize that a personal loan is likely much harder to pull because there is no collateral, but that's what I'm seeking at the moment.

&amp;#x200B;

Besides them, I've looked at a few other banks and loan companies that seem like they would offer the loan but at a stupid interest rate, all around 20%. I don't entirely understand how it works, but somehow it would add almost 10k in interest over the term of the loan. If I took one of these stupid interest rate loans, then almost immediately attempted to refinance through my bank or get a consolidation personal loan, would my chances be far higher to get approved, since the loan wouldn't be a random unsecured loan for cash, but to pay now already existing debt?

&amp;#x200B;

Like I said, I feel like this is all probably pretty stupid on my part, but I'm curious on everyone's takes and or opinions on the matter, or recommendations for other financial institutions to look into.

inflation,Is it just my area? Growing trend of not listing Price per LB on Beef and Pork...,"Have noticed it gradually here and there but at the local grocer tonight probably 2 thirds of the Beef and Pork no longer list price per lb. I have been seeing it here and there but there was a clear and rapid growth in the amount. Would have taken a picture but I was on my way back from cutting firewood and didn't have my phone.

I imagine the desired effect is a psychological one  to reduce sticker shock. Where someone probably wouldn't pay 6.99 lb for chuck roast they just say here is a package of meat for $13.00. I also don't see it clearly labeled what the actual weight of the package is in total. Frankly I have and will continue to do my best not to purchase these items as I feel it's dishonest merchandising.

Note: I haven't really seen this at walmart YET. But speculate it's only a matter of time. I also see a growing reluctance to mark items near expiration down. It seems that the retailers would rather throw things away than allow consumers to apply downward pressure on prices by refusing to buy at regular retail. I spent about 5 years with walmart as grocery department manager (about 10 years ago) at store 100 across from the home office. That store is not a good example of your average walmart as they train future store managers there and they do their best to build unrealistic expectations with an abundance of employees they don't get when they move on to their own store. The waste in dairy and produce was always a lot but i can only speculate what it is right now.  We always did our best to mark product down to where it would move by providing a substantial discount (33% or more).

Now I am seeing shit that expires tomorrow with a %10 markdown... Sorry, I am not gonna take the chance of spoiled shit for a %10 markdown and I assume most consumers feel the same way. I imagine the vast majority goes in the trash but would love to hear anybody in currently grocery (at any retailer) chime in.

Just more inflation obfuscation. I would love to see a historical chart of the bullshit ""basket of goods"" calculation that FED points to to say ""Look only 4% inflation"" with the total weight of that basket of goods. Is anyone aware of a product database that might have that data going back any length of time. I would absolutely take the time to filter that data and would love to provide a chart that would show accurate ""Shrinkflation"" data. I am pretty sure that anyone who has that data has probably been approached asking them not to release it to the public. I'm 42 and in my short life I have seen TV dinners got from 16 oz. to 14 oz. to 12 oz. to 10 oz. with some now being 8oz. I could go on and on about every day products like this and I think most others could but it would be great to put hard numbers to it to call out the bullshit you hear from the people who are supposed to be the stewards of our currency.

Lastly I want to say that there was some regulation that stated grocery goods must have a listed product weight and there was an agency that was supposed to enforce it (consumer protection bureau?)... That might not be so but I feel like I remember reading it somewhere.

I guess i'll quit ranting now but wanted to know if everyone else is seeing the same.

vet,Sick 1 yr old cat,"Our indoor 1 yr old domestic short hair tabby gets sick every 2 weeks. Not an exageration, every 2 Wednesdays he gets sick and todays the day. This has been going on for the past 6 months now and nobody has any idea whats going on with him. Weve done bloodwork, ultrasounds, gone to several different vets, 2 emergency vet visits and nothing. Here are his symptoms, vomiting, no appetite, doesnt drink water, doesnt poop because he doesnt eat, hides from us, is all poofed up, eyes dialated, breathing fast, crouched down when he does walk but mostly lays down, looks uncoordinated when he tries to move around, and doesnt sleep because hes uncomfy. There are others i just cant think of them rn. This isnt a gradual thing either, hes fine one minute and a few mins later he throws up(usually foam) and the cycle starts over again.
He does have FELV and HCM, the HCM isnt progressing and may be dormant for several years(this is what our vet cardiologist from UC Davis said) and his white blood cell count is completely normal. Weve tried pepcid, cerenia, b12, apitite stimulants, and bupomorphine. They dont help. Weve tried feeding him more often, doesnt help, weve tried exotic proteins, and also single proteins, doesnt help. The only luck weve had was giving him b12 every day and cerenia every other day. It held it off for 4 days but he still got sick and he went back to the 2 weeks schedule. We really just have no idea what to do anymore. Money isnt an issue, we have great insurance and id give everything i own to help him. For the 3 days hes sick yeah he is sick, but for the other 11 days, he runs around and plays with the dogs, has zoomies all the time and works full time at the biscuit factory.

51. Elon’s going to make the blue check mark accessible to all for $8 (or the purchasing power equivalent in your country) and also reward content creators.

60. Apparently, Twitter has a program called Birdwatch that could be used to add “readers notes” to misleading tweets about Cardano.

69.

76. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

100. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout.

stocks,Why invest in CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD),"First up is CrowdStrike, a leader in the cybersecurity world. CrowdStrike’s line of products, featuring its Falcon Endpoint Protection, offers users the industry standard in digital security for online and network protection. The company’s product line includes a wide range of cloud modules through the Software-as-a-Service subscription model.

CrowdStrike won’t report its next quarterly numbers until the end of this month, but we can get a feel for the company’s strong niche by looking at its last quarterly release, for fiscal 2Q23.

To start with, the company has recorded powerful gain in revenue and earnings in recent quarters. The most recent report showed $535.2 million at the top line, an increase of 58% year-over-year; the gain was driven by a 60% y/y increase in subscription revenue, to $506.2 million. Annual recurring revenue (ARR), an important indicator of future income, rose to $2.14 billion in fiscal Q2, up 59% y/y.

The company’s top line gains unsurprisingly came along with solid additions to the customer base. CrowdStrike reported a record quarterly gain of 1,741 new customers in its 2Q23 release.

These gains all led to the fifth quarter in a row of sequential EPS gains. The non-GAAP EPS was reported at 36 cents, up from 31 cents in fiscal Q2 and more than double the year-ago figure.

Lastly, the company showed an impressive cash flow in the quarter. Cash from operations rose 94% and hit a total of $210 million. This included an 84% y/y gain in free cash flow, to $136 million.

At the same time that the company has been posting solid financial results, its share price has also suffered from the twin blows in increasing inflation and increasing interest rates. CRWD stock is 30% down so far this year.",finance,1668671460
financial,Help: I Don't Care About Money,"Hopefully Someone Here Can Help Or Understand

Im 44, and a Uber driver. I love it. Without telling my life story,  I have always worked for myself and have had various jobs (like 2-3 I tend to stick with what I do) and have made a lot of money and also not very much at different times. I haven't saved anything for retirement and I want to start. I have a job I can do that I don't hate that has brought me $10K at a time, but I haven't done it in a few years. Why? That's the issue.

I don't care about money, like at all. I want to be fed and have a bed and a car but that's pretty much it. I just don't WANT anything that money can buy. If I won the lottery, not much would change. Id get a slightly bigger house, a nicer car and start a company. That's about it. I don't try to feel this way, I just do. I would want to make a lot of money for my son and ex wife (we're getting back together) but not for myself. I really just don't care about money. However, I know I cant work forever and now I see the value in ""stability"", financially speaking. So, I'm going to do that job that has brought me money before and I want to invest. Cloud Crypto mining has caught my interest. I want something I can obsess about and learn, I don't just want my money to sit somewhere. I want to be active and learn to grow it with skill. I feel I would be much better and more likely to keep this change if I we're involved. I thought about stock trading but when I started to read about it I hated it. I don't care about the stock market. Crypto mining interested me because it's computer stuff and I love computer stuff.

How can I change my attitude towards money? What could I invest in that I can be involved in that takes skill? I heard more millionaire's are made by real estate than anything else. That other job that I made the big money in was real estate. What do you think about cloud crypto mining?

Thanks",finance,1668673911
CryptoCurrency,"Despite having millions withdrawn in the past few days, there is seemingly still no problem with Crypto.com - maybe they've actually been fine the whole time?","Fear in the market over the past two weeks is the highest it's been for a long time. The unprecedented level of funds withdrawn has put a lot of pressure on the exchanges. 

Crypto.com is far from perfect - they've nerfed reward after reward, perk after perk all year. And as someone who does have a VISA card with them, I have been ruthless about my level of dissatisfaction, especially in their main sub. It really p....d me off to lose my staking rewards. 

In a rush to prove their ability to meet client demands, they released their wallets, and one dude found a mistake that they made weeks earlier. Cue Crypto-Twitter and a new massive wave of ""They are cheating the system. Are they the next exchange to go under? They blew all their money on sporting arenas""  ...that last one was from me.

* JP Morgan Asset Managers are forecasting an average annualized 7.2% return on the 60/40 portfolio over the next 10-15 years
* This is compared to a previous forecast earlier this year of 4.3%. The 60/40 has been challenged this year by cratering stocks and high bond prices at the start of the year, crushing yields. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Now things are starting to look brighter. The latest CPI data raised hopes that inflation may have peaked and the Fed can afford to tighten policy at a slower pace. That likely bodes well for both equities and bonds.    
&gt;  
&gt;While JPMAM’s forecast is for average annualized inflation to be above the Fed’s target at 2.6% over the next 10 to 15 years, that’s much more benign that the 7.7% in the latest reading. Higher bond yields also provides a better buffer for a portfolio, with 10-year yields hovering near 4% from 1.51% at the end of last year.  
&gt;  
&gt;“With higher yields, bonds are once again a plausible source of income and a potential safe haven,” Bilton said. “At lower valuations, equities are more attractive. The combination of higher yields and lower equity multiples means that markets today offer the best potential long-term returns in more than a decade.”

The microinverter has 2 mppt, each one should be fed by two solar panels in series. One of the MPPT is left empty since I only got two panels.

Ideally, the system should be generating around 1200Wp, given that the microinverter output is up to 2000W. It looks like the inverter is reaching its max output, but way bellow the expected numbers.

# [Stock futures fall as investors weigh cross currents of latest earnings](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Thursday as investors responded to the latest batch of quarterly results and awaited a slew of Federal Reserve speakers.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average dipped 192 points, or 0.6%. S&amp;P 500 futures slipped 0.6%, while Nasdaq 100 futures also fell 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Retailer Bath &amp; Body Works jumped more than 20% after it beat revenue expectations and doubled what was anticipated for per-share earnings. Cisco was up more than 3% after beating both earnings and revenue estimates. Macy’s popped 8% after surpassing expectations in its third-quarter results.
*****
&gt; The latest moves followed a down day on Wall Street, the second in three days. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.83% and 1.54%, respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 39.09 points, or 0.12%.
*****
&gt; Downward pressure emerged from weak guidance from Target, which reported a decline in sales as inflation pinches shoppers heading into the holiday season. The Minneapolis-based chain ended 13% lower, while its forward guidance cast doubt on other retailers.
*****
&gt; Target followed better-than-expected reports earlier in the week from Home Depot, Lowe’s and Walmart, which beat expectations and said inflation was not hitting them as hard.
*****
&gt; “There’s an adjustment process that’s going on,” by companies, said Thomas Martin, senior portfolio manager at GLOBALT Investments. “I’m not saying that’s a reason to take no action in a portfolio, but trying to chase things usually ends up meaning you’re making a bad decision and then another bad decision and another bad decision.”
*****
&gt; Investors will also watch tomorrow for weekly jobless claims, the latest reports on on October housing starts and building permits, and manufacturing surveys from the Philadelphia and Kansas City Federal Reserve banks.
*****
&gt; Earnings season continues Thursday with additional retailers, including Kohl’s before the bell and Gap after.

Economics,Fed’s Bullard Says More Hikes Needed to Get to Restrictive Level,,finance,1668691552
stocks,Fed’s Bullard says rate hikes have had ‘only limited effects’ on inflation so far. Says funds rate upper bound could be closer to 7%.,"St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday the central bank still has a lot of work to do before it brings inflation under control. A voting member on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, Bullard delivered remarks centered on a rules-based approach to policymaking. Using standards set by Stanford economics professor John Taylor, Bullard insisted that the moves the Fed has made so far are insufficient. Even using assumptions he characterized as “generous” regarding the progress the Fed has made so far in its inflation fight, he noted in a series of slides that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” “To attain a sufficiently restrictive level, the policy rate will need to be increased further,” he added in the presentation.

There’s little if any dissent on the Fed over whether rates need to continue to rise. Most members have suggested a few more increases over the next several months that will take the central bank’s benchmark overnight borrowing rate to around 5% from its current target range of 3.75%-4%. However, Bullard’s presentation argued that 5% could serve as the low range for the where the funds rate needs to be, and that upper bound could be closer to 7%. That is well out of sync with current market pricing, which also sees the fed funds rate topping out around 5%.

personalfinance,What is the best way for me to Leverage my small real estate property to buy a primary Home for me and my Family?,"We are a couple (27M, &amp; 24F ) and About 3 years ago, I purchased a small townhouse for about $30,000 with cash in a LCOL place. I put in about $7,000 worth of repairs and rented it. Ever since then, I have been collecting rent from the place and has helped me and family a lot. This property was bought in a state (PA) different to the the one I was living and currently live (NYC). So basically I am renting an apartment in one city, while my property is rented and located in another one.

Fast Forward to 2022, we have come to a point in which we would like to find a way to move from New York to PA. I have moved up with my company into a middle management role. Due to this, I am able to work remotely indefinitely, so I can keep my NYC salary and work from somewhere else. I will only be required to take maybe quarterly trips to the city.

These are my stats for a better understanding of my situation:

**INCOME**

Household Annual Salary : 75K Gross (About $4750 Net/Month) (Wife is studying and does not work)

Real estate income : 9.6K Net/Year

Total Monthly Net Income = $5,550

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**ASSETS**

Value of the property : 68K - 72K (According to Redfin/Zestimate; I don’t owe anything on it. No mortgage associated with it.)

401K : $6,000

Brokerage: $7,000

Cash : $15,000 (Will jump to 20K End of Year after Bonuses)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

**LIABILITIES**

Federal Student Loans = 46K (6% annual interest)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________


**EXPENSES**

Real Estate expenses : 5K Net Annually ( Renters insurance/Taxes/Trash/Water)

Total Monthly Net Expenses: About $3,000 all Bills (Rent/Real estate Expenses/ StudentLoans/ Etc) [Not Counting Miscellaneous expenses]

_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 


The main issue for me is that I want a home in the 225K - 250K range. And given that I am no longer a first time home buyer, I would have to put 20% down which at this range would be somewhere around 45K-55K . This is not easily obtainable. Not only that, but interest rates are incredibly high at the moment. I can find places in PA cheaper than this, but I would not want to do that given that the entire reason for this is to live in a calmer/safer environment and be able to raise children. I am trying to find a way for us to try and get a primary home, but I seem to get nowhere. If I try to sell the house, I would get destroyed with taxes. I can't refinance a mortgage since I don't have one. I tried to look into HELOC, but those interests are like 9%; and it would be hard to get a HELOC on a property anyways. Living in the rental property is absolutely not an option for us. We don't like the neighborhood or the city that is in anymore. Any ideas on this situation?",finance,1668692990

solar,Net Metering in Massachusetts,"New to solar, trying to understand the information I am being told by the salesman. I am in Massachusetts with National Grid Electric. I was told the excess power I produce is credited back to me at the same price as the if I was was purchasing. So if it currently costs me 0.35/kWh to purchase power when not producing, I will also receive a credit of 0.35/kWh for the excess I produce. I thought my excess power was purchased back at a discount.

Also, the fees on  the low interest rate financing is ridiculous, which bring the yield up to market rate. But I was told one benefit of the high fees is that they are using it in calculating the Federal Tax Credit. So  if I purchase a $35k system with cash I would get me a $10.5k  Fed tax credit, but if I went with a low rate financing that adds $15k in fees, or $50k, I would get $15k Fed tax credit.

personalfinance,Credit card company says they wont accept my payoff?,"I have a credit card i was going to payoff in a lump sum, but when i called to make the payment they wanted me to agree to not be a part of a class action lawsuit they have currently filed against them- when i told them no i wouldn’t sign away my rights for something they might’ve done the representative said they wont take my payment unless it is the monthly payment schedule? I don’t want to pay the interest, is this even legal?

EDIT: hey everybody- i guess its time i came clean, this actually isnt my credit card. a few comments said it seemed shady but thats because it is- the truth is its my mom’s credit card, and i didnt want to spread her business online so i tried to keep it vague and to the point of what the heart of the issue was and said it was my card.

i spoke to her about you guys suggestions and she said she was ok with me posting the full story and thinks its cool a place like personal finance exists and said she wishes she had something like this when she was younger-

The company is [portfolio recovery](https://www.portfoliorecovery.com) associates, they’re a debt consolidations company and they issued my mom a credit card of some sort that she could use to pay off her other debts for a lower interest rate- she had roughly 10 in credit card debt across a few different cards that she was having issues paying the amounts off because the interest rates were so high- so she went to a financial lawyer / accountant guy and he advised her to look into companies like portfolio recovery.

Just so happens portfolio recovery is an awful company Apparently and has a few class action lawsuits against them currently and has more in the past- didnt know this at the time she worked with them but its in the past.

So anyways- she told me about the issue above- she was calling them every month to make payments but she had a relatively small amount left on the account and wanted to pay it off in full, which is when the representative over the phone told her she cant- unless she pulled out of the class action lawsuits they have filed against them. 

I told her that sounds totally wrong and probably illegal- and came here and made the post for guidance, i didnt think about paying them online since it wasnt my account and kind of had tunnel vision concerning how can they say they WONT take your money?? 

But we were able to pay it all off online no problem- i don’t think my mom would recommend this company and i wouldn’t either! Hope that answers all questions 👍",finance,1668701198

CryptoCurrency,Feels like 2006-2008 in the market. Not sure if we are closer to beginning or end of extreme volatility and not trying to predict.,"Many folks remember the exuberance of the market in virtually all asset classes in the mid-2000’s.  Prior to 2022 it has felt the same to me, however the glaring difference has been interest rates and free money.  I think the low rates and easy access to capital have been negative forces overall. Take the pandemic out of it(even though that put more money into the system), the low rates caused good actors, bad actors, and everyone in between to chase yield.  Who was providing the best yield….the crypto industry.  A lot of the people who have gotten involved over the last 24-36 months will be leaving soon; voluntarily or involuntarily.  Just thinking about it in terms of sheer numbers the US Treasury approved $700BB in available TARP funds to save the financial industry.  That may be a drop in the bucket after current market conditions subside/improve in crypto, however there will be no fund to save anyone.  At the end of the day, after we flush the toilet of the issues that have roiled the markets this year, crypto could come out stronger, probably not brighter, but stronger which is likely a good thing.  Rushing to judgement on the effects to crypto with  every collapsing exchange or scumbag CEO to step down will eventually be in the rear view mirror.  MSM will do anything they can to belittle the industry and try to kill it for various reasons but I feel the industry will be lasting.  Just not sure how long the current storm lasts.

stocks,U.S. weekly jobless claims drop; housing market struggling,"*  **Weekly jobless claims fall 4,000 to 222,000**
* **Continuing claims increase 13,000 to 1.507 million**
* **Housing starts drop 4.2% in October; permits fall 2.4%**

WASHINGTON, Nov 17 (Reuters) - The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week, showing widespread layoffs remain low despite a surge in technology-sector job cuts that has raised fears of an imminent recession.

The weekly unemployment claims report from the Labor Department on Thursday, the most timely data on the economy's health, suggested the labor market remained tight. That, together with strong retail sales growth in October, will keep the Federal Reserve on track to continue raising interest rates, though at a slower pace amid signs inflation is starting to subside.

""This is a testimony to how tight the labor market remains,"" said Robert Frick, corporate economist at Navy Federal Credit Union in Vienna, Virginia.

Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped 4,000 to a seasonally adjusted 222,000 for the week ended Nov. 12, the Labor Department said on Thursday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast 225,000 claims for the latest week.

There has been an increase in layoffs in the technology sector, with Twitter, Amazon and Meta, the parent of Facebook, announcing thousands of job cuts this month. Companies in interest-rate sensitive sectors like housing and finance are also letting workers go.

The layoffs have so far not been evident in official data. Unadjusted claims dropped 6,101 to 199,603 last week. Claims in California, the epicenter of the technology job cuts, rose by only 302 last week. Big decreases in claims were reported in Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana and Texas, offsetting notable increases in Minnesota and North Carolina.

Economists say businesses outside the technology and housing sectors are hoarding workers after difficulties finding labor in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic. With 1.9 job openings for every unemployed person in September, some of the workers being laid off are probably finding new employment quickly.

Economists at Goldman Sachs dismissed worries that the technology layoffs were flagging an imminent recession in a note this week. They argued that technology job openings remained well above their pre-pandemic level. They also noted technology-sector layoffs have not historically been a leading indicator for deterioration in the overall labor market.

""Announced tech job cuts have frequently spiked without a corresponding increase in cuts in other sectors and have otherwise been a coincidental indicator,"" they wrote.

The Fed has raised its policy rate by 375 basis points this year from near zero to a 3.75%-4.00% range as it battles high inflation in what has become the fastest rate-hiking cycle since the 1980s. So far, the economy is weathering the tighter monetary policy storm, with data on Wednesday showing strong retail sales growth in October.

U.S. stocks opened lower. The dollar rose against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.

## HOUSING STARTS FALL

The claims data covered the week during which the government surveyed business establishments for the nonfarm payrolls component of November's employment report. Claims rose marginally between the October and November survey periods, suggesting another month of solid job growth. The economy created 261,000 jobs in October.

Next week's data on the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid will shed more light on November's employment report. The so-called continuing claims, a proxy for hiring, increased 13,000 to 1.507 million in the week ending Nov. 5, the claims report showed.

But the housing market is crumbling under the weight of higher borrowing costs.

A separate report from the Commerce Department on Thursday showed housing starts decreased 4.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.425 million units last month. Economists had forecast starts would slide to a rate of 1.410 million units. Housing starts dropped 8.8% on a year-on-year basis in October.

Single-family housing starts, which account for the biggest share of homebuilding, tumbled 6.1% to a rate of 855,000 units, the lowest level since May 2020. Single-family homebuilding declined in all four regions.

Starts for housing projects with five units or more slipped 0.5% to a rate of 556,000 units. Multi-family housing construction has fared better as soaring mortgage rates force many potential homebuyers to remain renters. A key gauge of rents surged by the most on record on a year-on-year basis in October, according to the latest consumer price data.

The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is averaging above 7%, the highest level since 2002, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac.

Data on Wednesday showed confidence among single-family homebuilders fell for an 11th straight month in November.

Permits for future home construction fell 2.4% to a rate of 1.526 million units in October. Single-family building permits dropped 3.6% to a rate of 839,000 units.

Permits for housing projects with five units or more slipped 1.9% to a rate of 633,000 units.

vet,Bile build up in picky eater cat,"*TLDR - very picky eater is having bile buildup, possibly from not eating enough.*

Smoky is 13 years old and weighs about nine pounds. 

She has hyperthyroidism treated with Methamizol. She is also prone to pancreatitis and has had some typical elderly-cat kidney issues. She takes a potassium supplement, FloCat for urinary health, and AminAvast to help with her kidneys. 

I recently took her to her vet because she was vomiting bile between 4 a.m. to 5:30 a.m. nearly every day. He ran her typical blood tests and took X-rays. 

The good news is her blood test revealed a significant improvement with everything at normal levels and she had gained a bit of weight. 

However, while showing me the X-rays, her vet indicated that the vomiting is being caused by a build up of bile. He suggested I move her evening feeding time to 10 p.m. Her blood pressure was also elevated and she was given a medication to manage that. 

I moved her feeding time and got some immediate results. But only temporarily. I’m almost certain her issue is that she doesn’t eat enough. Part of that is my fault as I should have been feeding her three times instead of twice. It’s not seemed to be an issue in the past, but I’m sure it is to some degree. 

She is given Rachael Ray’s Nutrish Sea-Sational Florentine after a lengthy search for a wet food she would actually eat. She was moved off of Iams dry food at the vet’s recommendation as it seemed to make her nauseous. I supplement her diet with Iams Sensitive Digestion which she does eat from time-to-time daily. Mostly I do this because affording a wet-food diet for my other cat (4 y.o.) is financially difficult (Smoky costs me about $300 a month alone.)

However, when Smoky is fed, most the time she’ll lick the “sauce” and barely eat the solids. I’ve tried blending it up to no avail. I’ve tried other foods and she won’t even consider them. I recently tried to incorporate a bit of Royal Canin in hopes of transitioning her to that, but not only did she not want to eat the new food, she wouldn’t touch the Nutrish with it on the same plate. 

So - I’m frustrated and looking for possible advice here. Does she need something to increase her appetite? Is there another way I can battle the bile buildup, has anyone experienced an extremely picky cat before?

Money isn’t a huge issue, and I’ve certainly spent a good deal in the pursuit of the wet food she’d eat. Im willing to do it again, but I’m a bit concerned because I was told by her vet that the Royal Canin is pretty widely accepted by cats. 

She’s an amazing cat who’s been part of the family for a long time. She truly is treasured and I’m dedicated to her well being. 

Thank you in advance, sorry this became a novel, but I wanted to be as thorough as possible.",cryptocurrency,1668704894
gaming,nintendo rant!!,"Im tired of nintendo fanboys!!

Sometimes its healthy to blow off a little steam when frustrated with a company or product that you want to like, and spent hundreds of dollars on. Yet it becomes even more frustrating when criticizing a large company for the weird business practices ends with you being called a cry baby. 

I DONT WANT TO NOT PLAY THE SWITCH, I WANT IT TO NOT BE A CHORE!!

I bought a switch for my son. My first complaint about fanboys is, they keep saying the switch is only $299. Now while some online places do have it for that price, i generally try to avoid online purchases because you dont know what condition it will be in after fedex or amazon gets done chucking it all over their warehouse (ive worked for fedex and ups, they definitely chuck your shit) I paid a retail price of $350 plus tax and it was the same price everywhere i went.

I bought assassins creed ezio trilogy for me and minecraft for my son. After downloading what i needed to play minecraft, and downloading the contents of the ezio trilogy, i found that there was no more space on the switch. Fanboys say it would take nothing to go buy a memory card, but for me, after dropping nearly 400 on a system, its outrageous to have to buy a memory card just to play 4 games total. The ezio games were released in 360 era, meaning that nintendo was well aware of the storage capacity needed to play these types of games by the time the switch was released. 

The controls are awkward. I understand that the concept is cool, yet at the end of the day, if a controller isnt comfortable, you are less likely to want to continue playing the game. Fansboys say to go buy a classic controller, but that is another money pit to get around the fact that nintendo's in box controllers are uncomfortable. They even provided a joycon dock, but the dock turns the joycons into a square shaped controller, which makes absolutely no sense after years of R&amp;D into what shape is comfortable for human hands. I shouldnt have to buy an extra controller because the company knows what they provided isnt comfortable. 

The joycon has issues. Our left joycon has an analog that doesnt click. But due to the wacky ass control scheme, i assumed that it was apart of the design. THEN I MADE IT TO AC REVELATIONS Finding that i actually needed the left analog to click for me to go into eagle vision. Of course this was almost exactly 3 months after purchase so the natural warranty was done for. Fanboys on reddit say ""this isnt a problem anymore just send your controller in and get it fixed"", but should i really have to go without playing the game entirely because nintendo created a controller that comes out of the box broken? 

The crazy part is, if this was sony or microsoft sending broken controllers out of box, people would rightfully lose their shit and down those companies to the fullest extent for being sleazy. Because of lack of storage, and terrible control design, we barely even use the thing and its still broken. 

The game goes through flickering black outs when attached to the dock. This is one that i cant understand at all, because as i said, we rarely even use the thing, so there is no chance that we messed up the hdmi cord. I went to reddit to see if anybody else had this problem, only to find fanboys claiming its an easy fix and you have to ""connect things in a certain order"". Ive been playing video games since about 5, with my 1st system being my grandmothers NES, which is about the last time i had to ""connect things in a certain order"" for the image to be displayed properly on my screen. 

Im probably just looking for some sort of validation that these issues are abnormal for a game released at any modern time period, even more abnormal for a nee system out of box. Ive bought used abd refurbished shit from gamestop with far less issues then i have experienced in my 6 months of owning the switch.

Its weird to see so many people making excuses for what im sure is a billion dollar company that is over 100 years old. 

My last complaint is the game catalog. While there are many games i havent played, the issue is that games other than mario, zelda, and pokemon seem to get very little promotion. Maybe there are quality games, but ive never heard of them. Even when a fanboy speaks on what games are good, 95% of the games listed in their own arguement is just different types of mario games, zelda games and pokemon, with 2 or 3 other major titles that go against the grain with a 5 year old system. They be like ""oh you think nintendo has no games other than mario, zelda or pokemon. Maybe you havent heard of a little game called breath of the wild"" I go look up breath of the wild to find out its just another zelda game. 

My experience with the wii and trying to buy games other than mario has left me scarred for life, as everything i bought for that system looked like a computer game from the early 2000s and they still manage to be overpriced. 

Fanboys say ""sony and microsoft have other aspects of business to focus on so they can afford to drop their prices"". Yet when you factor in all they do, you have to factor in expenses for creating all those things as well, its not like their other endevors are 100% percent profit. 

If anybody should have a more diverse set of games, it should be the company that has a 100 percent focus on gaming, which is nintendo. Yet they focus on mario, zelda ,and pokemon and keep alot of 3rd party games off of their platforms because their money pit gimmicky controllers, and decade old operating systems dont reallt allow for 3rd party games to be simply ported over, and a developer would have to put in alot of extra work to create a game that would run smooth on normal systems and the switch.

Bottom line is, nintendo does alot of weird shady shit, you dont have to be rich to enjoy a nintendo but as the best games never drop in price and the controllers come broken out of box and the controller is uncomfortable causing you to need a different controller. It seems you need to have a substantial amount of throw away money to play the system in the way game systems have been played for at least 2 decades. They will keep doing it too, because of the people who will read these legitimate complaints, and in the end, Claim im a crybaby, overexaggerating, or broke, or the worst of all claim if i have complaints about something i really want to enjoy, then i should just not play it at all.",technology,1668706392

stocks,"GM expects EV profits to be comparable to gas vehicles by 2025, years ahead of schedule","*  **General Motors expects its new electric vehicles to be in-line with traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by mid-decade.**
* **GM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the significant increase in profits factors in federal incentives under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act**
* **That timeframe is years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.**

General Motors expects its new electric vehicles to be in-line with traditional cars and trucks with internal combustion engines by 2025 – years ahead of schedule and what many expected was possible.

GM CEO Mary Barra on Thursday said the significant increase in profits factors in federal incentives under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act, which includes money back for companies that produce EVs in North America as well as consumers and fleet customers that purchase the vehicles.

“It’s clear these credits are going to help usher in a new era of technology innovation and job creation that’s going to achieve what was intended,” Barra said during an investor day in New York. “It will be good for the American economy. It’ll be good for American families. It’ll be good for the environment, and frankly, General Motors is well poised.”

Near-term profitability plans for EVs as well as its outlooks for the economy and business during a period of rising interest rates, surging inflation and recessionary fears were expected to be focus points for investors and analysts during the event in New York.

GM is bullish on its profits and plans regarding EVs largely thanks to its investments in recent years on a new vehicle platform called Ultium as well as ongoing construction of domestic plants through a joint venture called Ultium Cells LLC with LG Energy Solution.

The joint venture is expected to be operating plants in Ohio, Tennessee and Michigan by the end of 2024, which would make the company a leader in domestic cell production; a fourth U.S. cell plant is planned.

Wells Fargo Colin M. Langan is “skeptical” that GM’s electric vehicles can be sustainably profitable by 2025, even with incentives in the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act. He said pricing and raw material assumptions will be key.

“At the last Investor Day, GM promised ICE-like EV margins by 2030. Since then, battery raw material costs have dramatically spiked; therefore, it would be surprising if GM can still see EV profitability by 2025,” Langan wrote Tuesday.

GM previously said it secured binding commitments for all the battery raw material it needs to deliver its 2025 electric vehicle capacity target of 1 million vehicles. The company also has plans for capacity of 1 million EVs in China by then as well.

Spouse and I (late 30s) are both maxing our contributions to traditional 403(b) accounts ($20,500 each). We are not currently putting any money into Roth accounts, though spouse has a small one from before.

I've been reading about the potential tax benefits of having different pots of money to draw upon in retirement. I understand why I might want to do this, but how do I go about deciding what portion of money to dedicate to a traditional account versus a Roth? 50-50? 75-25?

Everything I'm reading (and the free Vanguard adviser) just says ""consider the potential benefits"" without giving any hints about a) general best practices or b) how to figure out my individual situation.

I have no 401k/investments. I have $13k in savings, which used to be $18k but I was laid off in June and spent some time unemployed before taking on a contract job, then dumping that when landing this position. 

401k match is 4.5%  I know I want to at least do that. I've seen people recommend pretty consistently to max 401k contributions which is $20,500? That feels like a lot. But I can be persuaded. I’m also not sure how pummeled by taxes I’m going to be at this new income.

CryptoCurrency,The logical consequence of a Central Bank Digital Currency (CDBC) is getting rid of cash,"On November 15,  the Federal Reserve Bank of New York announced that ""*its New York Innovation Center (NYIC) will participate in a proof-of-concept project to explore the feasibility of an interoperable network of central bank wholesale digital money and commercial bank digital money operating on a shared multi-entity distributed ledger.*"" \[[NY FED](https://www.newyorkfed.org/newsevents/news/financial-services-and-infrastructure/2022/20221115)\]

In July, the EU announced similar plans for a digital Euro \[[FAZ.net](https://www.faz.net/aktuell/finanzen/digital-bezahlen/digitaler-euro-koennte-in-drei-jahren-kommen-18465387.html), german\]: ""*The authorities have been examining the possible introduction of a digital variant of the European single currency for a while now. \[...\] Whether a digital euro will come is not yet decided.* ***In any case, a digital euro would complement cash and not replace it.***""

The CBDC's main purpose is for Central Banks to be able to **control and supervise all financial transactions**. They will tell us that it will be easier for retail sellers to accept digital payments and the currency will prove to be more stable, that it will be easier to get loans and make oversea transfers. But that's just sugarcoating for 'we want full control'.

Not surprisingly (and not coincidental) the EU is targeting privacy coins: [The EU may ban banks and crypto providers from dealing in controversial privacy-enhancing coins under new anti-money-laundering plans](https://www.businessinsider.in/investment/news/the-eu-may-ban-banks-and-crypto-providers-from-dealing-in-controversial-privacy-enhancing-coins-under-new-anti-money-laundering-plans/articleshow/95539027.cms).

**So how likely do you think is it that governments will want to keep cash alive?**  It pretty much contradicts its main advantage of CBDCs for governments. Money laundering is still mostly being done with cash.

Right now the EU Commission is planning a [limit of EUR 10,000](https://thepaypers.com/payments-general/eu-commission-planning-limit-of-eur-10000-for-cash-payments--1250546) for cash payments. Later this limit could be lowered to make the use of cash even less handy. A piecemeal tactic like this one would not come as a surprise.

Do I need a tinfoil hat now or will the government stop letting cash circulate after the CBDCs go live? Even if there is still some cash in its natural habitat, there is less cash available over time as banks withdraw it from circulation.

# tl;dr

EU and the US are pushing plans for digital currencies. Is there a plan to make cash obsolete? That could be suspected, since they are targeting privacy coins and crypto in general as well as they are planning a 10k cash limit.",cryptocurrency,1668712875

personalfinance,Auto Loan to Diversify Credit Mix or Full Payment Upfront?,"I'm looking at buying a car sometime in the next calendar year, I'm pretty well situated for it financially and definitely need something more updated than what I'm currently driving (an '05 vehicle, but it only has \~60k miles on it, and some sentimental value) due to a handful of safety/maintenance concerns. My credit score is currently in the low 760s after a new line was opened, but I'd estimate a higher score when I do make my purchase.

I need to decide whether to take out an auto-loan (in conjunction with a high down payment) or to pay in full with cash or a high-limit/no-limit cc (if possible to get rewards points, which would then immediately be paid off in full). The only advantage to the auto loan is that I can get a good interest rate from my credit union and it adds to my credit mix since my only lines of credit are credit cards (no student loans, mortgage, or personal loans).

To begin my real career goals, I want to attend an online art school to learn to be a visual development artist, and the total cost will be $7000-$10,000 for 9-12 months. Because it's not an accredited/degree type online college, just certification, I cannot get financial aid or student loans for it (as far as I've researched.) so the only option looks to be a personal loan. 

10k is a large amount and I've never taken out a loan before so I don't want to fall into anything predatory. But I also think it'll be worth it in the end if after schooling I secure a good paying job in the field I actually want to work in and pursue my dreams.

vet,Elderly shiba with gastrointestinal problems - Pls help!,"Hey guys, sorry in advance for the long-ass post... I just really don't know what to do anymore.

I really need your help with my 14 y/o shiba inu (f). She's usually still very energetic and active for her age, apart from a slight catharact, a spinal disk condition (under control, no pain for a year) and having suffered from pyometra 4 years ago, after which she was spayed.

Her symptoms started last thursday: She suddenly started shaking, pacing around  &amp; showing signs of colic at night until she finally threw up all the food she ate ca. 6 hrs before. It was only partly digested but all in all she seemed to be feeling better after that and fell asleep again. So I thought it simply was a bit of indigestion but then same thing happened on saturday and sunday, each time between 11pm and 3am. During the day her behaviour was completely normal - still running and jumping around at the beginning, though maybe a bit more tired on sunday.

So we obviously went to the vet monday. They did a full check up with blood analysis (including blood glucose, inflammation score, pancreas, liver and renal function) and everything seemed to be completely fine other than a slight microcytosis (normal in asian breeds). So her vet prescribed an antiemetic drug, an antacid, gastric protection and a probiotic powder plus a diet of bland chicken/rice.

After that she seemed a lot better (apart from occasional cramps/short bouts of nausea) until she started having colics yesterday night which lasted for hours. Lots of shaking, pacing, panting, lip smacking, swallowing &amp; drooling again. And this time she also seemed to have a lot of gas (burping/flatulence) and whenever she stood up, she'd have this arched back posture. She even jumped into the bathtub and started whining and groaning - obviously she was in a lot of pain.  Later, we had to go out for a short walk at 4 and 6 am during which she had diarrhoea (horrible odour, second time light reddish brown, very liquid). When we came home she was very lethargic, refused to eat or even drink and could hardly stand (swaying). I force-fed her some water because she seemed so much worse than before.

So back to the vet again this afternoon. They still think she has a bad case of gastroenteritis and injected her with the antiemetic again, as well as a pain killer and something else. I was instructed to give her a deworming pill + something for her diarrhoea tonight and more antiemetics tomorrow.

But, contrary to what they told me,  she's in pain and refuses to eat again tonight - hence, I have trouble to give her her meds. She also started kind of gasping for air from time to time... maybe from cramps? Thank god she started drinking again, though.

Now, I don't really know how to help her anymore - the emergency vet can't take any more patients tonight. If anyone has an idea, I wold be SO SO grateful! Maybe I'm panicking for nothing... it's just very scary to see her like this at her age.

personalfinance,Tax Advice on Turo Vehicle Depreciation,"I’m looking for some help navigating my 2023 taxes. I bought a new 2022 Subaru Outback in April with a 2.9% interest rate and rented it out through Turo over the summer tourist season. 

Some background info on me:

Annual gross income 2022: $89k
W2 income: $82.5k(one Job)
1099K income: $3.5k(Turo)
1099Misc:$3k(Alaska PFD)

Debts:
$26k car @2.9%
$6k CC @18%

I’m working hard on the credit card. It should be paid off shortly. 

After some preliminary research, I plan to report the 1099K as a sole proprietorship on a schedule C. As I understand it, I have two choices to document expenses;  actual and per mile. I’ve been pretty diligent about keeping receipts so had planed on filing with the actual costs. This will allow me to write off registration fees, has, cleanings, maintenance, insurance and interest. I’ve also read about deducting the depreciation of the new car that was bought this year. According to [Intuit](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/small-business-taxes/business-use-of-vehicles/amp/L6hi0zzzh) I could deduct $19,200 for total depreciation.

What are the implications of this? Do I need to file for an EIN to be a sole proprietor? Help!",finance,1668757491
vet,I'm concerned for my cat. Get ready for an essay.,"My 14 year old Russian Blue has been acting significantly different these past few months. Originally, when we lived with my mother and her 2 dogs down in SoCal, he ate his daily cup of food, drank water throughout the day and his litterbox showed no signs of concern. 

When I moved up to the central valley, he didn't exhibit any changes in his behavior despite the new environment. He picked his spots and laid about unless he felt gracious enough to honor me with his presence. For 4 1/2 months he was the same as he had been for the previous 13 1/2 years. 

Summer came and the temperatures were in the 100s. My apartment is busted ass cheap. No AC. I noticed that he began to eat less and only drink water. A surplus of water. I figured it's the drastic change in heat. Obviously he's used to the 70s so he'd be stressed out. He spent all day in the bathroom: in the tub or on the floor to stay cool. Over the 2-3 months of heat, I noticed he was becoming concerningly thin. He had meat on him but his bones could be felt more than before. I got him a water jug and an automatic feeder so that he can eat at his leisure.

It was a  bit after that I found a SURPLUS of cockroaches in his feeder. Once I had thoroughly drowned them out, sanitized, and made sure the feeder was clean, he started eating again...but he began eating very quickly and excessively drinks water. His poops are very loose and if I don't scoop his litter daily then his urine will start to pool onto the surface. Despite his active appetite, his body has become even more skeletal but his pouch has grown to the point its almost taut. And even with a fresh box he has been urinating on the carpet frequently. I frequently check his feeder for signs of roaches but find none and the traps do their job well.

He displays no change in his general behavior around me, only coming to me when he wants to be pet or fed/watered like he has for 14 years. But the changes in his body have me very concerned. I've just brought him back down to SoCal just so my mother can take him to his old vet to get checked and keep him under her care for a while. 

We have a feeling it's worms but could it also be something else that could be life threatening? I just want to know whether or not I should start preparing for the final sleep...",cryptocurrency,1668764707

Bitcoin,Why all roads lead to Bitcoin and why fiat yield farm investors will be exit liquidity for central bankers and the Fed,"The US currently has a debt to GDP ratio of around 130%. Historically, the risk of default if debt to GDP of a country is above 100% is 98%.

That means the US has a 98% probability of default.

If you don't believe this check this out:

[https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1575132870418567170](https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1575132870418567170)

There are two roads to default.

A) Official default. If that happens the global financial system would collapse. In such a case you absolutely want to hold portable, hard to confiscate assets with no counterparty risk. Road A leads to Bitcoin.

B) Unofficial default, a smarter road to default. In this case the Fed and other central bankers suppress interest rates below the rate of inflation while debasing their currency. This is also called financial repression. In this case bond holders/creditors never get their original investment back(after adjusting for inflation) even though the US did officially not default on their debt. The US will likely choose this option.

In that case you don't want to hold fiat yield farm coins(government bonds) while the Fed dumps USD on you Terra-Luna style (their size really is size).

Don't forget that Terra had to print always more of their coin to support their yield product UST. In this case the US dollar is Luna and government bonds are UST, the unsustainable yield product.

1 USD will always be 1 USD so it can't lose it's peg unlike UST but it will lose it's peg against all other goods when the government has to print like crazy to continue to pay out yields to USD debt investors. The dollar will be sacrificed like Luna to support the government's yield product but investors will still lose a lot of their money after adjusting for monetary inflation.

Boomer governance tokens (stonks) might be a much better option but they are already overvalued and if there is sustained high monetary debasement the economy will hurt and so will stock earnings.

What you want in that case is an asset that can't be debased and that is not a fiat derivative. Road B also leads to orange coin.

Alternatively, the unproductive yellow rock that needs a bigger fool buyer (gold) also looks attractive but if it does really well our digital tulip banker poison² coin would likely do much better.

Central bankers will of course hope that people hold on to their fiat bags as the bag holders help undo the mess they have created losing their personal savings. That's why they will want to convince people that gold is a terrible investment and bitcoin is going to zero while they gradually devalue the dollar towards zero.

They will also want to convince people that all problems are socio-economic, geopolitical or whatever but never due to monetary policy itself.

Many will fall for it because government bonds are presumably risk-free and some entities will have no choice as they will be required to hold bonds in their funds or on their balance sheet.",cryptocurrency,1668768882

inflation,A supply driven inflation - high inflation will take time to go down - How to protect ourself against inflation?,"Hi everyone,

Everyone knows that high inflation has hit the world.

This time the inflation started as a supply driven inflation:

1. especially gas and coal became much more expensive, and the oil price reached previous highs
2. interruptions in globalised production cycles due to covid shutdowns, lack of material, ...
3. lack of labour
4. logistical problems (Suez March 2021, lack of transports, transport through Black Sea (Ukraine-Russia, ...)

&amp;#x200B;

On the other hand many other parts of the world reopened their country/economy after more than 2 years of Covid restrictions AND during 2 years a lot of people spend less while being financially supported by their governments (The demand side):

5) People investing more in their house/furniture/... instead of going on holidays during covid

6) Reopening after Covid =&gt; Like the roaring 20's: People want to make up for lost time during Covid = much more spending in holidays, ...

7) The global Money Mass that did 3x since the financial crisis of 2008/2009, but during 10 years the commodities didn't become 3 times more expensive... (Commodity prices have a lot of catching up to do, some already did too much catching up (coal, gas, ...), other commodities not (Oil price only reached previous highs, uranium price not even reached the highs of 2011 (LT contracting price \~72USD/lb) and the highs of 2007 (LT price \~95USD/lb, spotprice 134USD/lb))

&amp;#x200B;

**The consequence of this originally supply driven inflation is that this time the inflation will be much more difficult to get down.**

Why?

Because the central banks have tools to slowdown the demand side, not to stimulate the supply side.

They can't increase commodity production in the short term, commodity production will only increase if the incentive price has been reached. And some crucial commodities (uranium today, rare earths today, copper in LT, ...) didn' t reach that incentive price yet

They can't increase Labour availability, governments can (pushing more people to go back to work)

They can't solve production cycle interruptions in other countries (China)

They can't prevent the fact that China and India will claim a bigger share in several commodities:

\- gas and uranium because they want to reduce their use of coal (even if they build additional coal-fired power plants at the moment) and increase the share of use of gas-fired power and nuclear power

\- Copper and rare earths

&amp;#x200B;

The only thing that central banks can do is really crushing the economies so that demand side reduces significantly, because the supply side problem will not be solved in 1 year time.

How?

By significantly increasing the central bank rates.

BUT that would mean that in theory the FED for instance would have to increase the FED rate to 8 - 10%. By doing that they would really crush the american economy and get inflation down fast (12 months time?)

But doing that would create a big problem on the level of government bonds, hyperinflation for other countries (most commodities are in USD), the portfolio of pension funds, fund requirements of banks and insurance companies, ...

So in my opinion, the FED, ECB, BOJ, ... can't increase the rates that way, and will slowdown the rate hikes sooner and keep those higher rates high in the long term.

This would slowdown the decrease of inflation.

So I think the high inflation will remain here much longer than just 12 months.

&amp;#x200B;

**How to protect ourself against inflation?**

**This isn't financial advice. Please do your own DD before investing**

1. if possible, buy your own home instead of paying a rent
2. invest in material today that you know that you need today or will need in the near future
3. invest in physical commodities (Gold, Silver, Copper, Uranium, ...) for the longer term ( longer term for me is &gt;12 months)

&amp;#x200B;

Commodities like gold, silver, copper, uranium, ... are mined. For this you need a Labour force, Fuel for the Bulldozers and other machinery, Material to use during mining, Energy

Those things make your production cost

But due to inflation, Labour, Fuel, Material and Energy cost went significantly higher, by consequence the production cost of those mines went significantly higher.

The consequence is that if the commodity sell price doesn't go higher to compensate the increasing production cost, that less commodities will be mined. And if less commodities are mined, less supply will decrease, which eventually increase the commodity price.

&amp;#x200B;

There are a couple differences between commodities:

a) Gold is 99% not consumed, but stored in bars, coins, juwelry since centuries

b) Silver is the little brother of Gold, but Silver has also an industrial use

c) Food (Livestock and meat, Agricultural products): For ethical reasons I don't invest in those commodities, because my investment would make food more expensive for people.

d) Copper is an important commodity for the industry in general and by consequence is often referred at as an important barometer of the world economy. Copper is also very important for a decentralised electricity production (renewables)

e) oil is an important commodity and the oil demand is price ELASTIC: When oil price goes to high the oil demand decreases (remember the oil crisis of the 70's)

f) uranium is the only commodity for nuclear reactors (global nuclear reactor capacity increases year after year, and now a big uptick in the use of nuclear power has started (China, India, South Korea, Japan, USA, ...)) and the uranium demand is price INELASTIC:

When the uranium price doubles or triples than uranium demand will not decrease.

Why?

Because:

\- nuclear power is baseload power, meaning that when the economy slows down the electricity production from gas, coal and oil-fired power plants will be reduced first.

\- the natural uranium cost only represents \~5% of total production cost of electricity from a nuclear  reactor, while the cost of shutting the reactor down due to fuel shortage will cost so much more for the utility than paying 2 or 3 times the uranium price of today

Explanation:

Total electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 50USD/lb uranium price = 100

Total electricity production cost of electricity from nuclear reactor with 100USD/lb uranium price = 100+5=105

That's only an increase of 5% of total electricity production cost.

&amp;#x200B;

How to invest in the commodity sector?

1. mining stocks, but here you also have the mining related risks (GDX, COPX, REMX, URA, URNM, ...)
2. physical commodity, here you aren't exposed to mining related risks (PSLV, PHYS, U.UN, SRUUF, ...)

Following the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s $32 billion empire, which included a large US subsidiary, lawmakers and regulators in Washington have sought to shift blame to each other for FTX to go between the meshes of the net.

Bitcoin,Where to borrow fiat with BTC as collateral to buy more BTC?,"I'm looking for a decent lender, to buy more  BTC using BTC as collateral.   I'd be holding for months or maybe years.

Ideally, of course, I'd like the lender to be unable to lend my collateral over to other parties or to spend it on anything else (mutisig with an arbitrator) ; but in the real world, here are the requirements:

Requirements:

1. not cut-throat interest rates
2. clear rules on margin calls, that allow for at least 24h  to add more collateral no matter how low the price drops
3. be decent (the most difficult part). In particular this means that their standing should not depend on the price of random  shitcoins.

   4. I'd like to avoid ""wrapped BTC"" and any exposure to shitcoins

Examples:

\- Blockfi has just flopped; apparently satisfied 1 and maybe 2 (subject to negotiations?) but not 3.

\- SALT has just flopped;  I don't know what conditions they had, but clearly failed on 3.

\- Ledn has not flopped (yet). They had a very high dependence on Genesis capital which has died recently, but they managed to disentangle themselves fast enough. I'm not sure they satisfy 3.

\- Kraken  I'd say is decent enough (of course one can't never be sure), but their interest rates compound to like 40% per year, so not suitable for my purposes (may be fine for a day trader but not for a long-term loan).

**At least $1 billion of client funds missing at FTX**  
The cryptocurrency exchange's founder Sam Bankman-Fried secretly transferred $10 billion of customer funds from FTX to his own trading company Alameda Research, according to sources speaking to Reuters. A large portion of that total has since disappeared, say the sources, who put the missing amount at between $1 billion and $2 billion. While it is known that FTX moved customer funds to Alameda, the missing funds are being reported by Reuters for the first time. In text messages, Bankman-Fried said he ""disagreed with the characterization"" of the $10 billion transfer. He continued, ""we didn't secretly transfer, we had confusing internal labeling and misread it,"", without elaborating. Asked about the missing funds, Bankman-Fried responded: ""???""

**Australian Federal Police say cybercriminals in Russia behind Medibank hack**  
The Australian Federal Police (AFP) say they have identified the perpetrators of the hack and attempted extortion of health insurance company Medibank, which stated last week that it would not be making a ransom payment after hackers gained access to the highly sensitive data of 9.7 million current and former customers, including 1.8 million international customers living abroad. Although the AFP did not identify the perpetrators by name, they appear confident that they know who they are pursuing and that they are based in Russia. Medibank has now been listed on the extortion site formerly operated by REvil. Listeners who are interested in pursuing this story may be interested in a podcast episode released by *The Guardian* in their *Full Story* series, which is out right now and which describes the hack and its developments in greater detail.

**Australia considers ban on ransomware payments**  
We’ve been covering the details and fallout from the most recent high-profile hack to hit Australia, impacting the insurance provider Medibank. Combined with the Optus breach, personal data on a large percentage of Australians became exposed this year. Now Australia’s home affairs minister Clare O’Neil proposed making ransomware payment illegal, with the aim of decreasing profitability for such breaches. Critics of the proposal say it would move ransom payments underground, using third-parties in other jurisdictions. The government also announced the formation of a new cyber-policing model between the AFP and the Australian Signals Directorate to create a joint standing operation against cyber attacks.

**Thousands of sites used for brand impersonation**  
It turns out massive brand impersonation isn’t just a problem for Twitter these days. According to a report from researchers at Cyjax, China-based threat actors known as Fangxiao operate a massive network of over 42,000 domains, meant to impersonate popular brands. The group isn’t new to the game, first spotting spoofing firms since 2017. It uses the sites to redirect users to adware, dating sites, and fraudulent giveaways, generating revenue from clients who pay for traffic. The sites try to appear convincing, with researchers noting extensive localization options. The group appears to register roughly 300 new brand domains daily.

**The effectiveness of Ukraine’s IT army**  
At the G20 Summit’s “Digital Transformation” panel, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the country’s “IT army” successfully stopped over 1,300 Russian cyberattacks since the start of Russia’s invasion. He also pointed to lessons other countries could adopt to deal with modern cyber warfare. This ranged from shifting to cloud-hosted public registers to keep up benefits to those displaced by the war, to how it kept its Diia state site operational with over 100 contactless public services. This allowed Ukraine to keep offering things like digital passports, tax services, and other critical infrastructure .

**Ten new ransomware families on the scene in the last six months**  
That finding comes from Ivanti’s “Ransomware Report from Q2/Q3.” Overall, those ten new families led to a total of 170 documented ransomware families actively seeking to exploit targets. It also found some troubling gaps in ransomware prevention. 18 ransomware vulnerabilities did not get surfaced by popular scanners. The rise in ransomware vulnerabilities also saw a lag in government response, with 124 vulnerabilities not added to CISA’s mandatory patch list. The report corroborates anecdotal reports that healthcare, energy, and critical manufacturing remain the most targeted industries.

**Musk’s ultimatum to employees leaves Twitter at risk**  
In an email to staff entitled “A Fork in the Road,” Musk said employees had until the end of day Thursday to decide whether to be part Twitter 2.0. Musk said those who stay should expect to work long, intense hours while offering three months’ severance pay to those who leave. However, many more workers declined to stay than expected, potentially putting Twitter’s operations at risk. Just hours before his deadline, Musk tried to retain key personnel by pitching his plans for the company and softening his tone on his remote work policy. The mass exodus has created a cloud of confusion over which people should still have access to company facilities, prompting Twitter to close its offices until Monday. This is ironic given Musk’s recent mandate for Twitter staff to return to the office.

**Iranian APT breaches government agency using Log4Shell**  
Iranian government-sponsored threat actors breached the Federal Civilian Executive Branch’s (FCEB) network by exploiting the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server. The Iranian APT group then installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised creds, and then implanted reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA determined that agency was compromised as early as February 2022. CISA warned companies who detect the APT group’s indicators of compromise (IOCs) investigate connected systems and privileged account logs.

I need some help with understanding and picking a Health Plan from my provider for the upcoming 2023 year. 
We are planning to have a baby and this being our first time I am unaware of the costs and how to best plan
for this with our insurance selection. One note is that I work for a hospital so I'm not sure if these plan rates
are considered good or just run of the mill.

If someone could help give me some guidance on which option makes the most sense it would be greatly appreciated. 
I think partially I am underestimating the cost of having a child, but also perhaps the billing aspect of it is
far different than I assume. A few general questions I have.

1. Is it very common to hit the deductible when having a child? $3000/8000 (the HDHPs below) seem so high to me but again I have no measure to guide against. 
2. Are IP stays for the example of the EPO below of a $250 copay charged per day or the entire stay?
3. Are delivery charges and everything once admitted covered in that $250 copay for the EPO?
4. Should I max out the HSA/FSA during a year I plan to have a child? Will I definitely use up these funds given the costs of having a child?

HDHP (Cigna) - Employer Contribution $1500
Federal Limit Contribution (HSA): $7750
Federal Limit Contribution (FSA): $2850

Option 1 (Preferred In Network)
Paycheck Contribution: $133.39
Deductible: $1500 Individual, $3000 Family/aggregate
Maximum OOP: $8000 Family
Office Visit: 80% after deductible
Preventative: 100% deductible waived
IP Hospital: 80% after deductible
OP Hospital: 80% after deductible

personalfinance,Should I move out? 22y,"Good Afternoon,

A little background: 22, going on 23M. College graduate 2022. Northern VA making 75k.

I currently live at home with my family and work roughly .5 miles away. I make roughly 75k a year (before taxes) and will have roughly 10-12k saved up before the new year. I have a total of 20k debt all in federal student loans and I qualify for 20k debt forgiveness under Bidens plan (now that is up in the air and I am preparing as if it is not a thing anymore). (Car fully paid off, no credit card debt). I work in luxury apartment property management and have the opportunity to move in to a brand new 1b apartment with a 75% discount and would be looking to pay around 500-600 for rent. (Currently I help my fam out with a little over $500 a month.). The move would be looked to happen in around February/ March. This being said, I am also in the process of applying for OCS with the military and expect to hear back early next year on if I am getting picked up. If I get picked up, I will head out for training around the summer time.

I know financially, the smart decision would be to stay at home, minimize my expenses, and save, especially with the potential to move soon for the military. I would be able to save around 3-4K a month and put it towards my loans and restating an emergency fund. If I decided to move out, it would set me back around 1-2k a month.

Is moving out truly worth the freedom at this point in my life? I get a lot of mixed advice from friends and family. Some say to stay at home while other day just move out because you can still afford it. My biggest financial goal is to purchase a home in the next 3-5 years so any little bit I can save now is probably the smartest thing to do even if it means sacrificing some peace of mind and freedom. Currently, I think waiting it out until I hear back about my ocs application is the smartest move and deciding from there.

investing,Lack of Liquidity in the Treasury Market,"I've been reading recently of a shortage of liquidity in the treasury market. Gregory Whitely of Doubleline Capital alerted the Financial Times of a trader wishing to secure a $400 million position in government bonds and was told to spread their trade out throughout the day rather than purchasing all at once. A $400 million position in a $24 trillion market seems like it should be a breeze to fill, but it's seeming like small dollar amount purchases (small in comparison to the total market) are having outsized increases on prices. 

JP Morgan Co-Head of US Rates Strategy finds that, ""market depth, or the ability to transact without impacting prices, has deteriorated to it's weakest since the March 2020 tempest."" 

Greg Peters, co-chief investment officer at PGIM Fixed Income says, ""markets are in a much more fragile place with terrible liquidity. The way I think about fragile market function is that the odds of a financial accident are just higher.""

A contributing factor to this lack of liquidity could be tempered demand from Japan. The world's 3rd largest economy, and the largest foreign-holder of US Treasuries, has greatly slowed purchases of US Treasuries in recent months. On September 22nd, Japan entered the foreign currency exchange market to sell US dollars to help prop up the falling Yen, leading to a 19 basis point jump in US 10 year yields, the 2nd largest one day jump year to date. Japanese life insurers and Pension Funds unloaded $40 billion in US bonds from April through September after accumulating some $500 billion in those same holdings since 2016.

personalfinance,How long does it take to get an inheritance from Lauth Investigations?,"My dad was contacted in August by Lauth Investigations that he and his brothers are the recipients of an inheritance from a cousin that passed away in 2012.  Because the original executor of the estate decided he wanted to hide the full list of heirs, when the estate was being processed, the judge found out about a whole slew of relatives who were not listed as heirs, so the judge turned the estate into a ""supervised estate"".  My dad had no clue about this cousin's death (my grandfather was estranged from his family), so it was kind of a surprise to us.

So in August, we filled out the paperwork saying that yes we are the decedents relatives and that we acknowledge that we are part of the new list of heirs.  We were told that the court process wouldn't take long, just a few weeks.  Any time we would contact the attorney's office we were given the run around and told to call Lauth Investigations.  When we would call Lauth Investigations, we would be told that this is a supervised estate and that any kind of paperwork or anything had to go in front of a judge to be approved and that they were waiting for all of the heirs, and by this time the list has gone from the original 3 people that the executor wanted to claim to now 40.  At the end of October, the court records show that all of the heirs have signed the appropriate documentation and on November 9, the final judgement was recorded that the dispersal of assets can finally happen.  Originally, the lady from Lauth said that once that judgement was recorded, it would only take a few days for everyone to get the checks. When I called Lauth on November 10, the lady said it could take two weeks to get a check.  I called yesterday since it had been a week and I was wanting the tracking number for the checks because my local Fedex and I have serious issues about their dropping packages and things for us at random places, so I wanted to see if that is how they are sending the check because that is how the original documents from them came.  So the lady told me that yeah, while the court case is listed as closed in the court records, it's kinda not.  They have to go back again and verify the addresses of the heirs then they can disperse checks.  She said if I don't hear anything after 4 weeks, give her a call and she will find out what's happening.  So I'm curious, how did we get from originally being told in August that it would just be a few days after the cased closed, to 2 weeks, to now ""if you don't hear something from us after 4 weeks, give us a call and we will sort it out"".  Is this normal????

personalfinance,To File Chapter 7 Bankruptcy or Not to File Chapter 7? That is the question.,"Hi there, and thank you in advance for your time &amp; insights.

My husband and I own a small business which has become unprofitable and we have decided to close it.  The business has $68,000 in debt ($24,000 is on an Amex in the business name and doesn’t show up on our personal credit reports; $44,000 is on personal credit cards in my husband's name only). 

My husband is considering filing for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

The only reason we see against it is that we would like to be able to buy a house in the next few years.  Other than moral reasons or unknowable future consequences, we don't see any reason for my husband not to file for bankruptcy.  We don't own anything like a house or boat, rent our 1 bedroom apartment, and own our cars. 

**My question:** if my husband files bankruptcy, could I be approved for a mortgage on my own with only my income? If so, approx. what amount? 

I recently started a job making $75k. My credit is excellent but I have $28,000 in student loans and $3,500 on a credit card. I have $43,700 in 401k and $9,000 in savings account.  I believe I will have to wait 2 years to establish my W-2 income after being self employed at our small business (that is closing up) for 4 years.

We have explored settlement too and will have to pay $1500 mo for 5 years to pay off the $68k (will be approx. $90k total with interest and fees), and we won’t be able to save any money during that time until he starts making an income too.

Another alternative to bankruptcy: my brother offered to lend us most of the money from his home equity line of credit (much lower interest rate than the settlement) and we would only have to pay interest for 9 years (we would pay more than that but the point is, it buys us time).

Does anyone have advice on our best course of action here?  Or just share your story if you were in a similar situation.  We don't have a lot of helpful financial advisors in the family, so anything you could share or input would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!",finance,1668796508

personalfinance,Mulling over Solar install costs and ROI,"So I'm exploring the options/benefits of installing solar on our home once we need to replace our roof (it's 18 years old, and we're in Florida where property insurance and roof replacements are kind of insane right now, we figure we could get a notice from our insurance at any time saying that we have to replace it or be dropped).

We got a quote from a reputable installer for \~$40,000 for a roof based solar system that would cover 90% of our electric use with a 25 year warranty.  Our current monthly electric cost averages around $220 per month which would be reduced to about $24 per month with the solar system (annual average), so we'd save about $200 on our utility bill each month.

They're offering financing over 25 years at 4.99%.  We would qualify for $10,300 in federal tax credits the following year.  So our options would be:

* Pay $40,000 up front, save $10,000 on next year's taxes, and save about $200 per month on utilities
* Pay $10,000 up front (which we'd recoup in credits the next year), finance $30,000 ($170 loan payment) and save about $30 each month on utilities
* Pay 0$ up front (we'd get $10,000 in credits the next year), finance $40,000 ($230 loan payment) and pay $30 extra each month

Those are forecasted at current utility costs, which have been rising rapidly.  The more our utility costs, the more we save (really the more cost we are avoiding), so with a 4% annual utility cost increase factored in, it looks much more attractive than what I've laid out above.

personalfinance,"After always using my whole credit limit each month by pulling the money through PayPal friends, CC company is now asking for proof what it's used for.","I'm in a somewhat tricky situation. I've had about 20k credit card debt across 3 different cards for some years now. To avoid interest charges, I've been borrowing 5k from a friend each month to repay my debt for each card only to always instantly pull the money again by sending it to my bank account by sending it to my sister first via PayPal friends and then finally back to my friend. Rinse and repeat each month, no interest paid. 

Well, now after years one CC has finally caught up with me, telling me in an email they've noticed m always transferring my whole credit with PayPal each month. They now want to 
- know who that person is I'm sending it to with PayPal
- know what I'm using that money for
  - with proof/receipts or even Email correspondence for that

They said if I don't comply with their demands within the next 4 days, my account may be subject to termination. As we know, I can't produce any of that, as the whole purpose of that procedure is to avoid interest charges.
Is there anything I can tell them to weasel my way out of it? I guess there might not and I will be stuck with that debt, slowly being eaten up by the interest. I've lost my job last year and am not receiving government support anymore (so I don't have any income, live with my parents) and here in Germany in this case you're obliged to pay medical insurance yourself in this case. Interest on top of that will quickly add up.

So, if I'm to be stuck with the interest on this debt, what else can I do? I was thinking about trying to get credit from a bank, not a credit card company, because they have much more manageable interest rates but that might prove difficult without a job. Any advice is welcome.

I'd probably need to pull through for somewhere between a few months and a year, then my financial situation will dramatically change.

personalfinance,Which Loan Should I Focus On?,"Hello all, I’m looking for some advice from the community.  Here is some quick backstory on my situation.  

I’m planning on purchasing a house within the next couple of years, and I’m trying to get my DTI in check, but I’m not sure how I should do it.  I currently have two major loans to contend with.  

One is a set of federal student loans totaling $18,000.  The interest rates on these range from 3.86% to 4.66%.  These are currently on forbearance due to the pause.  The monthly payment is set to be $250/month once the pause ends.  (Assuming that the $10k forgiveness doesn’t happen.) 

My second loan is actually in my parents’ names, but I pay for it, since it was a loan that they took out at our local bank to help fund my schooling.  That loan currently has a balance of $32,400 and an interest rate of 3.76% with a monthly payment of $655/month.  If I choose this loan, it can be paid off around Christmas of 2023.  

I’m getting kind of hung up on the pros and cons of paying off each loan.  I’m personally leaning towards paying off the private loan, because the monthly payment is much higher.  Even though it wouldn’t show up on my credit report, it is still a lot of money.  

I currently live at home, so my DTI wouldn’t be bad at all if the only thing I regularly pay on is my federal loans.  Plus, keeping these loans open should help my credit score improve.  

So, how does my plan sound?  Would any of you do anything different?  Or should I just start saving up now for a down payment?",finance,1668813676
CryptoCurrency,All the FACTUAL connections that may appear as corruption with FTX and the Democratic Party (maybe money laundering),"Let me begin by saying that everything in this post is factual. All sources are linked below. I know Reddit is highly liberal so let me say that I am not saying there was or was not any corruption or money laundering that occurred. Not everything here is correlated, maybe none of it is. I am just showing any relevant facts that I'm aware of that may help you form an opinion. If you see stuff you think is uncorrelated then that's your opinion, don't hate me for sharing facts. I am simply stating facts on what occurred and you can use your own judgement of said facts to form your own opinion. Feel free to leave any opinions in the comments.

&amp;#x200B;

1. FTX was launched in May 2019. The company made $85 million in 2020 and $1.02 billion in 2021 (over a 1000% increase from the previous year).  Over the past two years, FTX grew at an insane rate, making it one of the quickest companies to reach a valuation of $10+ billion.
2. Democrats control the presidency, house, and senate from 2020-2022.
3. A democrat controlled federal government (with the exception of the Supreme Court which is irrelevant in this case) gave tons of money in aid to Ukraine in their efforts against Russia. The largest aid package included $40 billion. Do keep in mind that a majority of money sent to other countries go to humanitarian aid and crisis groups such as Aid for Ukraine and not the Ukrainian government
4. FTX partnered with Ukrainian government officials and Aid for Ukraine to convert cryptocurrency donations into fiat currency.
5. Former founder and CEO of FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried, donated nearly $40 million to the Democratic Party in this midterm election cycle and became the party's second largest mega-donor.
6. The 2022 US midterm elections were held on November 8th, 2022.
7. FTX collapses, implodes, whatever you wanna call it, on November 11th, 2022.
8. FTX is hacked for hundreds of millions of dollars.
9. The SEC led by democrat Gary Gensler regularly met with SBF and FTX over financials and such. It is also worth noting that ""only a month before FTX imploded, he was instead engaged in a highly theatrical enforcement action against Kim Kardashian over a minor token sale from 2021."" 

10. EDIT: This is added in after original post but SBF donated around $262,000 to the Republican Party.

Well that's all I've got for now. There may be more in the future or that I am unaware of. So there are the facts, I encourage you to form your own opinion.

personalfinance,Take 12k+ severance package or stay with company in another department.,"I work for a big tech company that is playing to do layoffs in my department.
They gave us the option to take a lump sum severance package (approx. 12k before tax. Maybe 8k-9k after tax) which will make my last day late December 2022. Plus covering my health insurance for a few months.


I also received an offer for another department similar to mine, that starts in a few weeks. Same pay &amp; level. However, they are understaffed and need to onboard more once the hiring freeze is over. 

I asked about job security/potential layoff and the HM stated they don’t plan on having any within the team. However, the future is uncertain and anything can happen in 2023. 

I also have the potential to receive a pay raise in March 2023.

Benefits: great health, vision, dental; 401k, college tuition assistance, etc. 

I’m undecided whether I should take the severance package and job search/start a side business. I’m young and don’t have young kids to take care of or anything, so I feel like maybe I could take the risk.

The other option is to take the job offer and keep the potential job security in the midst of a recession.

# **S&amp;P 500 closes higher on Friday, but ends week with losses - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/17/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The major averages ticked higher in afternoon trading Friday to end the day on an upbeat note as investors assessed tougher language from Federal Reserve speakers and pored over the latest earnings reports.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 199.37 points, or 0.59%, to 33,745.69, while the S&amp;P 500 climbed 0.48% to 3,965.34. The Nasdaq Composite finished just 0.01% above the flat line at 11,146.06.
*****
&gt; All of the major averages posted losses for the week. The Dow ended 0.01% lower. The S&amp;P 500 lost 0.69% for the week, while the Nasdaq ended 1.57% lower. All three indexes are positive for the month, however.
*****
&gt; The market was divided for much of the day, with the S&amp;P 500 trading mostly flat as investors started to reset expectations after a couple of rallies over the past week, beginning with the October CPI print. Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg, said this week is characterized by a “back-to-reality viewpoint.”
*****
&gt; “Following the big rally coming off the better-than-expected CPI print, the market’s digesting the current data, which is bringing things back to reality,” she said. “The rally that followed the CPI print we don’t feel was justified by fundamentals… The market’s also pricing in a soft landing here, which we don’t think is likely to occur. So when you hear the Fed officials coming out and reiterating their stance, you’re starting to see the market readjust to that.”
*****
&gt; On Friday, Boston Federal Reserve President Susan Collins expressed confidence that policymakers can tame inflation without doing too much damage to employment.
*****
&gt; St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said Thursday that “the policy rate is not yet in a zone that may be considered sufficiently restrictive.” He suggested that the appropriate zone for the federal funds rate could be in the 5% to 7% range, which is higher than what the market is pricing.
*****
&gt; ""We continue to think investors should place much more emphasis on the actual data and not focus too much on Fed rhetoric (the former will show where inflation is headed while the latter is fixated on where it was),” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge. “That said, investors are tired of battling the Fed’s daily tape bombs and the fear is it may take 2-3 more CPIs for officials to stop admonishing the market every time it tries to rally.”

&gt; # Do Stocks Really Like Gridlock?

&gt; The midterm elections are over, and the results aren’t 100% official yet, but we do know that we’ll have a divided government. As of now, the Democrats have 50 seats in the Senate to maintain control there, while the Republicans gained their 218th seat in the House to take control there. The bottom line though is neither the Senate nor the House has large majorities, in fact, they are both near historically small margins.

&gt; So that’s the big question, do stocks really like gridlock? Of course, things are never this simple, as there are so many other factors that matter to how stocks do, but it sure looks like gridlock could be a tailwind for stocks. Or at the very least, not a major headwind.

&gt; Here’s a chart that shows all the times since 1950 we’ve had a divided government and how the S&amp;P 500 did in those years. The average return for stocks was a very solid 15.7% under a divided government, with only one-year falling significantly back in 1981, while 2011 was nearly exactly breakeven. The other years saw some solid returns.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-176-800x297.png))**

&gt; As of now, it is expected the Republicans will take a three-seat majority in the House (this could change, but it’ll likely be near this number). This would be the smallest majority for the Republicans since 3 seats in 2001 and 2002. Here’s a great chart that shows just how rare it is to have a majority this small. Fun stat, the House moved to 435 seats in 1913, meaning 218 seats gives a party the majority. Fun stat #2, the Democrats controlled the House from 1955 to 1994, but things have been more even over recent years.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-2-800x357.png))**

&gt; What exactly does a small-seat majority in the House mean? Odds are a small majority means there could be some gridlock, so do stocks like this? Below we show again this appears to be the case. When there is less than a 20-seat House majority, the S&amp;P 500 gained a median of 19.5% and was higher 12 out of 15 times when looking at the first year of a new Congress. In fact, 9 of the past 10 times there was a new Congress and a small majority, stocks finished higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-3-800x485.png))**

&gt; In conclusion, stocks really do appear to have no issues with a divided government and in many cases, stocks have done just fine under this scenario.

&gt; # Weakness Sets Up Bullish Thanksgiving Week/End-November Trade

&gt; The recent 21-year typical November graph here points to a seasonal cycle low point tomorrow, the 14th trading day of the month, the Friday before Thanksgiving and Op-Ex day. Thanksgiving week has a notorious “holiday fueled” bullish bias as do the last seven trading days of the month.

&gt; However, as you can see from the tables here of the history of the Thanksgiving trade the bullish bias has weakened over the last several years. The best short-term trade appears to be getting long into any weakness in the week or days before the holiday and selling any subsequent rally toward the end of Thanksgiving week or before month-end.

&gt; First published in the 1987 Stock Trader’s Almanac, the Wednesday before and the Friday after Thanksgiving combined were up 34 times in 35 years. The only S&amp;P 500 decline was in 1964. Subsequently, this trend changed. In the 35 years since 1987, there have been 10 declines and 25 advances. See 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac page 106 for more.

Although price action has been somewhat choppy and there have been plenty of other catalysts (FTX's collapse, more yield curve inversions, the missile strike in Poland) to balance out the inflation data and put investors back onto their heels, the latest AAII survey has shown a surge in bullish sentiment. The percentage of respondents reporting as optimistic jumped from 25.1% last week up to 33.5% this week. That is not only the largest one-week increase since the first week of June (when bulls rose by 12.2 percentage points) but is now the highest reading on bulls since the last week of 2021.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Bearish sentiment in turn dropped sharply falling to 40.2% for a decline of 6.8 percentage points. While an improvement, at the start of the month bearish sentiment had fallen by much more (both the last week of October and the first week of November saw double-digit week-over-week declines) and was at a much lower level of 32.9%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111722-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; The bull-bear spread has narrowed but still remains negative for the 33rd week in a row. If the spread remains negative into next week, it will tie the record streak from 2020.

&gt; Neutral sentiment fell for a second week in a row with the total decline in that time eclipsing 10 percentage points. At 26.3%, it is down to the lowest level since the week of October 20th, implying that investors have become a bit more decisive in their respective market views.

&gt; The AAII survey's more bullish turn this week was also seen in other readings on sentiment like the Investors Intelligence survey and the NAAIM Exposure Index. As a result, our sentiment composite which aggregates the findings of the three surveys into a single sentiment reading is back up to its highest reading since mid-August. Although the reading remains negative, it is no longer at the extreme levels that were common earlier this year.

&gt; # Consumer Discretionary's Muddled Relative Strength

&gt; Ranging from today's retail sales report to homebuilder sentiment to the earnings of some of the largest retailers like Target (TGT) and Lowe's (LOW), the economic and earnings calendar this week has given Consumer Discretionary stocks plenty of news to digest. Outside of the spring to late summer, the sector has generally been on the decline relative to the S&amp;P 500 in 2022. Last week, that relative strength line bounced right as it reached the late May low. However, over the past few days, it has been resuming its move lower, meaning it is back to underperforming.

&gt; While on a sector level the relative strength line has been falling, drilling down to the industry group level, there has been more variation. For example, even with some positive responses to earnings from the likes of Home Depot (HD) or Lowe's (LOW), the retailing industry has seen a sharp grind lower in its relative strength line versus the S&amp;P 500. Similarly, autos have seen a turn lower although it has been underperforming the S&amp;P for a longer period of time since the early fall. Meanwhile, Consumer Durables and Appliances (which includes stocks like the homebuilders and home appliance makers) has been moving higher. That move has paled in comparison to the relative strength of Consumer Services stocks (restaurants, cruise lines, hotels and resorts), though, as that group's line has surged over the past couple of months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-RSa.png))**

&gt; As mentioned above, retailers in the Consumer Discretionary sector have been underperforming the S&amp;P 500 lately but there is another group of retailers in which performance has been more solid. The Food &amp; Staples Retail industry is a component of the Consumer Staples sector, and its relative strength line has been trending higher since the spring lows. In fact, after the past week's move higher thanks in part to a strong response to Walmart (WMT) earnings, its relative strength line is approaching some of the highest levels of the past year, entirely recovering the massive drop from May in the wake of another, much more negatively received, WMT earnings report.

&gt; # How Bottoms Form. (It Might Surprise You.)

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rallied again last week and was more than 10% off the October 12 closing lows, before selling off some yesterday. Nonetheless, the truth is the overall news really hasn’t really been that great, yet stocks have staged a strong rally over the past month. What gives?

&gt; Turns out, this is what tends to happen coming off major lows for stocks more often than not. Our friends at JPM Asset Management put together some of the best charts I’ve ever seen to describe this phenomenon. You can read the whole report from Michael Cembalest here.

&gt; They found that from the Eisenhower recession in 1957 to stagflation in the 1970s, to the early 1980s double dip recession, to the 1990 recession, stocks turned higher well before the other parts of the economy began to turn higher. As you can see below, stocks tended to bottom months (and sometimes years) before earnings, GDP, and payrolls officially turn higher.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-166-800x527.png))**

&gt; More recently we saw similar action during the Financial Crisis and then again during the worst of COVID. I’ll never forget how stocks soared in April, May, and June of 2020, yet we saw some of the very worst headlines in our country’s history. The truth is the stock market isn’t looking in the rear-view mirror, it is always looking forward and discounting what could be out there in the future.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-245-800x257.png))**

&gt; To keep things honest, this doesn’t have a perfect track record, as, after the dot-com burst, GDP and earnings both turned higher well before stocks officially bottomed.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-chart-34.png))**

&gt; This in one of the more confusing concepts for many investors, but it is one that is so important to understand. Stocks will likely rise even as the news is bad, this is how it works. If you are waiting for things to officially improve, you likely will miss out on substantial gains along the way.

&gt; Burt White likes to say if you are playing a video game and you are going toward the monsters, you are going in the right direction. Investing is similar, as times will sometimes be extra scary, but this is part of the process. If you are scared or uncomfortable, that is all part of investing in a lot of ways and if you run the other way every time things get scary, you’ll likely never be able to meet your investment goals.

&gt; # Homebuilder Hopes Demolished

&gt; The national average on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has come back below 7%, but it remains elevated versus recent history as housing data still can't catch a break. This morning, the NAHB released their latest reading on homebuilder sentiment and for the eleventh month in a row, the headline index fell month over month. As shown below, the current streak of nearly a year straight of declines is far and away a record, surpassing two eight-month long streaks leading up to the Financial Crisis.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1a.png))**

&gt; This month, homebuilder sentiment dropped another 5 points down to 33. That is not the largest drop of the current streak of declines, with bigger drops of 8 points last month or 12 points in July, but it still ranks in the bottom 4% of all months on record. In other words, not only is homebuilder sentiment falling consistently, but it's falling fairly fast. The other components have also seen bottom decile declines with the only sub-index avoiding declines being in the West.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-2.png))**

&gt; After the November decline, the headline homebuilder sentiment reading sits 3 points above the spring 2020 low. Similarly, Present Sales and Traffic are down to the lowest level since April 2020 while Future Sales have actually surpassed those levels to now sit at the weakest reading in over a decade.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-1.png))**

&gt; Last month, we highlighted how the geographic breakdown of sentiment was showing homebuilders in the Northeast being much more optimistic than their counter parts in the rest of the country. In November, that region joined the rest of the pack with a massive 17 point decline. That ranks as the third largest monthly decline on record behind a 19 point drop in June 2010 and the 45 point decline at the onset of the pandemic in April 2020. While that has not been enough to result in a new low, similar to sentiment in the Midwest, sentiment in the South is down to the lowest level in a decade. The same could be said for the West although it rose marginally month over month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/111622-NAHB-3.png))**

&gt; As for the reaction of homebuilder stocks, the iShares US Home Construction ETF (ITB) is trading 1.1% lower as of this writing. As shown below, after last week's equity market surge on CPI in which the group moved not only above its 50-DMA but also its 200-DMA, ITB has continued to hold above its moving averages for now. Without much follow through on the post-CPI surge, any move above last week's highs would be a welcome bullish sign, whereas the 200-DMA is looking to be the critical level of support for the time being.

personalfinance,Capital One HYSA delaying funds,"I recently opened a Capital One High yield savings account. I do my main banking with Chase but the interest rates are practically non-existent but I love the service I get there. 
I like the interest rate at Capital One, but what is the deal with transferring between banks??? My initial deposit took 6 business days to post (9 regular days). They said it was because the account is new so the first deposit needs extra verification or whatever - I let it slide (although I'm not happy considering they told me 1-3 business days.

personalfinance,My mom needs an expensive dental procedure but does not have the cash. Her financial advisor recommended taking a margin loan. Is it too risky given the state of the market / dollar?,"Hi there, I'm trying to really help my mom navigate this stressful financial situation

She needs money for a $60,000 dental procedure. Insurance wont cover it.

Her advisor is asking her to sign a paper immediately to 'lock in' a \*variable\* interest rate of 7.75% on a loan of \*100,000. (she only needs 60k for her procedure). They assured her it was only to lock in the rate.

1. Does she have to pay interest on 100k? Or only how much she needs? Should her loan be only for the amount she needs?
2. They said fixed rate is not possible on a margin loan. Isn't it dumb to do variable right now when we keep doing rate hikes?
3. If stocks crash again (which I think they will), they mentioned to her she could get margin called. Is this a crazy unnecessary risk at this time? What does that mean exactly if that happens? She could stand to lose more than she borrows?
4. What is a better option than a margin call?

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Maximalism explained in less than 350 words,"The current monetary system (central banking, fractional reserve, credit expansion, treasury bonds, modern monetary theory) is **pure evil** and the main cause of so much suffering in the world related to money, work, stress, poverty and low quality of life.

Bitcoin fixes this. It separates money from the state and takes away the power from banks and politicians. It is designed in such a way that it can last for centuries and resist all sort of attacks. There is no single entity or group of people that controls it. The monetary policy cannot be messed with.

Altcoins (shitcoins) are an attack on Bitcoin because they distract people from the main goal, which is to replace the fiat monetary system. Their narratives rely on attacking Bitcoin (""it's old tech"", ""too slow"", ""has no utility"", ""bad for the environment""), slowing down its overall adoption. 

Most of these altcoins **1)** are scams that exist to enrich its creators, **2)** are centralized (their rules can be easily changed), **3)** solve no real world problems and **4)** are being used exclusively for trading as a way to earn more fiat. The entire industry is full of scams and endless promises.

The discovery/invention of Bitcoin cannot be replicated. It solves a problem that took humans thousands of years to solve: Scarce money that cannot be diluted or manipulated by anyone.

Altcoins are infinite. There are more than 20,000 altcoins and new ones are being created every day. There is no end to this. They do nothing more than suck up demand from Bitcoin and give the whole space a bad reputation. 

The only way we can truly help the world is by uniting under Bitcoin. 

Save in bitcoin. Accept bitcoin as payment. Spend your bitcoin. Onboard people and businesses. Educate others.

Everything else is a distraction.",cryptocurrency,1668822744

investing,Tactical asset allocation (TAA) vs strategic asset allocation (TAA) + TTA and put options combined investment portfolio,"Hello everyone! I would like to seek your opinions on tactical asset allocation as an alternative investment strategy to strategic asset allocation. My current stock/bond allocation is around 80 (VWRA - All world index + G3B - local index fund) /20 (MBH - local investment grade bond fund). When the fed fund rate falls and MBH bond price start to rise, I'm planning to readjust the asset allocation to 95/5 for stock/bond respectively and then back to 80/20 once VWRA price rises again. Is this a reasonable strategy to capture higher yield or are there hidden dangers I am not aware of?  


Secondly, I'm considering selling cash covered put options on S&amp;P 500 (since there are no options for VWRA and the majority of it's holdings are in S&amp;P 500 iirc) to complement this tactical asset allocation strategy (Basically earning additional yield while we wait for stock to crash to desired levels.)

CryptoCurrency,Depths of Despair,"It feels as though there is no light at the end of the tunnel. Every time there is a faint glimmer of hope, a new wave of darkness washes over. 

Bleak, all-encompassing gloominess swallowing the crypto markets whole. Every single semblance of a rally or comeback engulfed in this ever-permeating despair. 

There were hopes of riches in 2021. Dreams of escaping the quiet desperation of ceaseless servitude for menial pay, only to live a life of scarcity and longing. 

I feel as though with this latest drama and contagion, that final flicker of hope is being extinguished. The average person has been robbed by the companies they trusted in. Nowhere is safe to hold crypto anymore. 

If it’s an exchange, you will have your assets stolen. If it’s a DeFi platform, you will be hacked. And even if you don’t have it stolen or hacked, the value will go down so far that it might as well have been stolen.

CryptoCurrency,Which UK banks allow payments to crypto exchanges?,"Hi all,

I'm with Natwest bank in the UK, and when I started purchasing crypto on Binance ages ago I had to use the pay by debit card feature, then Natwest suddenly stopped allowing payments to go through.  So I got a Starling bank account app, started sending money there first, then from Starling to Binance to make the payment.  That's all been going fine, until just the other day that seems to now not work either. Both Natwest and Starling decline every payment I attempt to make to Binance.

Does anyone know a UK bank that allows payments from debit card to Binance?

I do buy off other exchanges, such as Uphold (because there are some tokens they sell that Binance doesn't) and strangely Natwest allows those transactions to go through.  But my main exchange is Binance and I'm fed up with banks not letting me spend my money where and when I want to.

I did what you all said to do about 2 weeks ago and I liquidated some investments and paid off my credit card. I was debt free for about, a week (given sell off, and transfer times) and then my car started to make a sound. Turns out my cars specific model and year is prone to high oil consumption which caused my piston rings to burn out, and seize. The fix is just a little over $6,000. 
I have $1,800 in emergency funds, and I’ve been offered financing from the dealership who’s fixing my car, 0% APR for 6 months but I don’t know the rate after that point. So, here’s my options and if I’m missing something please let me know. 

Option 1; 
Take another $4,200 out of investments (I have another $30,000 in a managed investment portfolio). And pay it off outright. 

Option 2; 
Pay the 1,800 into the amount owed, take the financing, and stick to my budget which should allow me to pay it off before the 6 month 0% APR period ends. 

Option 3; 
Sell the car, get a used car, and have a car payment for the next however many years. 
     (This is my least favorite option because I love my car and as the market is I won’t be able to find another car of this quality for even the amount I bought it for in 2017, given the used car market right now.)

Option 4; 
Whatever option you all come up with because some of you are financial wizards. 


Thank you so much for all your time and wisdom. I took your advice last time and now I have a budget and I feel like I’m starting to get on track. This is a major curve ball but there has to be a smart way to deal with this, right?


Edit because I’m getting a lot of the same responses and I’d like the clarify a few things; 

It’s a 2014 Honda Accord, I bought it in 2017 with no warranty. It was the first car I purchased outside of a 1999 Accord I bought from my neighbors for cheap when one of their family members offed themselves in it. Needless to say, I was 22 or 23 and I didn’t really think about the warranty. I have checked, my vin is not available for any recall or Honda warranty claim. 

I have shopped around for a better price for the repair, but I haven’t found anything better in the area, unfortunately for me, I live in one of the highest income areas of the US, and cost of living is higher than normal. Being military, I make enough to get by and that’s about it. I do have a budget I am sticking to, but this is a emergent issue and I am here asking for advice, not to be spoken down to for not having planned for my engine to eat shit. It’s a Honda Accord, all I’ve ever heard is how reliable they are. And, I got an oil change under a month ago. 

I can’t just not have a car, I’m active duty and lucky me just got put on a 1400-0000 shift for the next 9 months. We have a train but it doesn’t run into base during those hours, buses won’t go their either, and I live 30 mins away from work without traffic. There’s no biking or beating feet that I can do to get there. Even if I could, all bus stops and the train station are on the far side of base and I would have to walk off base in uniform to go back on base through the only available route to get to my job, which I can’t do because I’m a Marine and I can’t even stop for gas in uniform unless I’m about to run out and it’s an emergency. Even then it’s not okay, but that’s a Marine Corps-ism. 

Lastly, a few people have commented that I should know to check my oil every 1000 miles. I just had an oil change under a month ago, and I haven’t covered even 300 miles in that time.

CryptoCurrency,Crypto and the real economy,"One comment I've heard people make about the crash in crypto prices and numerous scandals is they don't affect the real economy. Traditional finance has a lot of stuff that's contained in the finance industry, but it also has an impact on farms, factories, imports etc. A change in dollar interest rates affects investment in real goods. As far as I can tell the closest crypto is entirely about digital assets. Is it just a matter of maturity and there will come a time when people take out crypto loans to build factories and make things?

personalfinance,Personal Loan Question/interest rates-help!,"I took out a personal loan two years ago 11.49% interest rate for $35,000. The payment is $850 each month. I’ve paid it down to $15,000.

I have a lender willing to do 6.99% for 36 months at around $500 per month. We just had a baby and was hoping to pay less monthly for the few months I am off until I go back to work.

btc,The Crypto Industry Has a Troubling Problem With Crypto Reddit and Reddit In General,"First off, I'm definitely going to have to make a new reddit account and abandon this one.

I have repeatedly tried to talk about the US governments belligerent behavior over and over in this industry, and how we were being long conned by deliberate politically motivated behavior by the agencies and by the State Department. Even most of Crypto twitter thinks SBF and FTX are feds.

I have been censored and banned from

r/CryptoCurrency

r/Libertarian

r/Bitcoin

and now r/ethereum 

You know why the eth mods screwed me over you wanna know what finally got them to turn on me?

I merely made a title that said that Ryan Salame gave 23 million to the GOP for crypto lobbying

I never claimed what FTX did was not bipartisan, I never claimed it was only the GOP, and I did not post a paragraph with the article I linked. They dog piled me and got turbo butthurt for me criticizing a party, the republican party of all things.

We all know if you criticize the democrat party on reddit, you will get mobbed, brigaded, tattled on and banned by virtually every subreddit. We aren't that stupid and naive. So color me shocked that they did it from the reverse!

I turn to the Bitcoin Cash community because everyone else has censored me.

We all know the truth.

The bitcoin maximalist movement post 2020 is an opp., it's a State infested Opp that wreaks of establishment corruption and wallstreet cooption, and their party of choice is the GOP, they buy off senators like Cynthia Lummis and lawyers like Caitlin Long, pundits like Max Keiser, and get talking heads like Michael Saylor to push massive SEC backed regulations and state surveillance,

worse they are reaganite american exceptionalism, they are unequivocally american imperialist, they do not care about the developing world whatsoever, their politics are peak 1980s american expansion in the appliance of global FinRegs, the FinRegs are the arm of the US empire.

They are anti-cypherpunk and anti-libertarian

They openly threaten our industry with state regulations.

The Samurai developer and privacy and paynym advocates in Bitcoin hate them and believe they are feds. 

I personally believe Crypto Reddit and Reddit in general is doing deep deep deep harm to the cypherpunk movement, because of it's tendency to simply bandwagon establishment US politics and what effectively 'empire narratives', which includes Financial Surveillance and unquestioning obedience to the SEC. 

I tried to make a post in ethereum last night, and of course I'm banned/auto-modded, what I was going to explain are how criminal the fees are on american exchanges and the CME futures.

You're effectively not only banned from futures trading as a US citizen, you're also banned from day trading. The ECP law is a 10 mil requirement and the accredited investing law is 1 mil.

Without arbitrum and optimism and layer 2 fees, there is no hope for US citizens having fee parity with tradfi, literally no hope without defi.

&amp;#x200B;

What do you think SBF and FTX and the regulators who he colluded with had intended with that Dccpa and regulated frontend for defi, what do you think they had intended with felonizing american citizens for using DeFi at all without collecting KYC when they passed the Infrastructure bill?

Rent collection. a monopolized front end where they can tack back on catastrophic fees onto optimism where you basically can't use anything. SBF was trying to destroy the liquidity on DeFi while USDC backdoored and rugged the rest of the liquidity by abandoning those protocols, because USDC is in bed with the State Department. 

You know what the fees for 100,000 dollars in notional size on micro bitcoin futures are? It's about 19 basis points round trip, compare that to deribit where it's only like 5 to 10% or binance is 2 to 8 percent. Or you can buy 1 contract for 20 thousand. It's not meant to be traded by retail, it's meant for HFT firms.

I'm genuinely not sure we can count on Vitalik or the Ethereum foundation and it's over proximity to american politics and venture capital to actually take a stand against this regulated DeFi front end stuff.

CZ saved this industry by standing up to the americans and blowing SBF up, without the asian markets we would be screwed.",cryptocurrency,1668870722

LG Display has unveiled the first high-definition display that can be stretched, twisted, and folded during use. The company’s prototype is a 12-inch display made of silicon used in contact lenses, to form a flexible film-like substrate with micro LEDs as a light source. It packs a resolution of 100 pixels per inch, about that of many monitors and TVs. LG Display’s new stretchable screen could be attached to curved surfaces like vehicles, aircraft, furniture, or many other things.

Scientists found a way to grow rice using seawater. Rice needs a lot of water to grow, it consumes about 5,000 liters of water per kg of grain produced. Being able to grow rice with salty water would be a game changer as many poor countries have direct access to salty ocean water. Seawater rice was developed by tweaking two genes present in conventional rice so it can tolerate high salinity and heat. The findings showcase the potential of genetically modified organisms in addressing food insecurity across the world.

Redwood Materials is a company founded by a Tesla co-founder. They focus on the recycling of batteries. They recently partnered with Audi to launch a kiosk where consumers can leave old household electronics up for recycling. Devices range from electric toothbrushes to electric shavers, and robot vacuums. The company can recover over 95% of materials such as nickel, cobalt, copper, lithium aluminum, and graphite from a lithium-ion battery. They can then return the minerals directly to the supply chain to make new batteries for EVs and energy storage devices.

Researchers have developed an edible drone that could save the lives of adventurers who are lost, injured, or unable to move. The team created a drone that is no longer only a food-transporting aircraft but is partially edible itself, increasing its food-carrying mass ratio to 50% thanks to its edible wings. The non-edible parts of the drone will be made using biodegradable materials as they will be left in the environment after performing their task in an emergency. The flight-capable prototype introduced by the scientists can provide 300 kcal and carry a payload of 80 g of water.

This new kind of induction stovetop will boil your water in 40seconds.  Induction takes a lot of power. It can even be the same as an at-home EV charger. A lot of older houses aren’t wired to plug in a Tesla in their kitchen, which means it could get expensive to upgrade to an induction range. That's why many households are still depending on gas appliances. Impulse fixes that, the company’s stoves include a battery solution, which means that it doesn’t pull the full power when it’s operating, and you could find yourself cooking with induction without having to upgrade your panel. The company is positioning itself in the challenge around residential and light industrial decarbonization.

It uses robotic shuttles to pick goods that are then presented to workers. The company says it’s able to accomplish this in 15% of the standard warehouse space by building up. The system can reduce warehouse space by 85% and requires just 20% of the workforce that traditional fulfillment centers need. The need for quick delivery requires fulfillment centers closer to major metropolitan areas.

I've never used them before. Alternatively, Betterment and Wealthfront are offering 3.2% and 3.3%, respectively.

**Upshot**: I'm putting 100K into a Schwab 12 month CD that's 4.8%. (I received a code that gives you up to 1K just for opening a new account, so that's a nice incentive too.) In addition to that, I'll be putting 10K into iBonds now, and another 10K in January (since the max is 10K per year) and those rates are north of 6.5% (they were *just* at 9.62% for 6 months but that expired in October.) So that's another 20K at 6.5%. Finally, I'm putting some of my rainy day money in the Wealthfront account (3.3%), so my liquid assets are making a tiny bit of interest.

"" **Crypto’s Future Is In the Regulated Banking System**

After hitting all-time highs in 2021, cryptocurrency prices haven’t found a definitive floor. And the appeal of crypto’s promise to reinvent money has also reached its limit in a very niche audience. To attract a bigger, more mainstream user base, the new technology’s advocates will have to completely overhaul how they promote it.

Imagine your cousin, your dentist or someone else you know who is the least likely to experiment with money or technology. I think about my mother. She’s never going to use a Bitcoin wallet at Coinbase or open a savings account in USDC, a digital stablecoin pegged to the dollar. She’ll never want a nonfungible token for a digital collectible on Tom Brady’s Autograph network. But she might be willing to verify her identity at her mortgage lender’s website if it allowed her to speed up the process for buying a house. And if that digital identification process was powered by the blockchain technology that underlies crypto, she wouldn’t even have to know.

Most people are like her: They have no interest in any new technology unless it can help them do things more quickly, more cheaply and more safely. That’s why iTunes was a winner. That’s why Amazon.com is a juggernaut. That’s why Netflix gained so many adherents. And that’s why payment apps such as Zelle and Venmo have mass appeal.

**Cryptocurrencies’ Rapid Rise and Fall**

The trouble with crypto so far—in addition to its volatility, the scams and the failures of untested intermediaries—is that a lot of the problems it claims to solve have already been solved. We can already send digital payments or set up online savings accounts. And we can do it with the same currency we use to pay our taxes and make cash transactions. So why do we really need cryptocurrency?

**Creating Trust**

Let’s go back to where it all started: our need to trust money. It’s why the financial industry is rife with such terms as trust, security, custodian, guaranty. Nonetheless, every so often there’s a calamitous break of trust in which bankruptcies proliferate, investors are wiped out and millions lose their jobs and homes.

One example was the Great Depression, when people discovered the banks to which they’d entrusted their money weren’t as secure as they’d hoped. In the aftermath, the power of the government and a new regulatory structure were placed behind the banks to help restore trust. In the US that meant the creation of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., the Securities and Exchange Commission and a new housing authority to help support an increase in home loans.

Then the 2008 financial crisis showed how inadequate those safeguards were. Big financial institutions and their regulators seemed unprepared for the collapse of home prices and the effect that had on financial markets and the broader economy. Suddenly people didn’t trust banks or the government.

Enter crypto. Bitcoin was born in a white paper published on Oct. 31, 2008, just weeks after Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the government and Federal Reserve started rescuing banks. The paper declared that digital commerce was overly dependent on trust in financial institutions. The idea was to create “an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust.” Effectively, trustlessness. Instead of relying on the bankers who repossessed your home while paying themselves massive bonuses, people could opt into a secure, decentralized network called the blockchain. Crypto, the enthusiasts said, would rival the existing centralized financial system in due course.

Almost 15 years later, this new money has lost much of its utopian appeal. It turns out that, for most people, this new financial system does require placing your trust in an ­institution—maybe a wallet provider or a token exchange or a decentralized finance (DeFi) lender. And too many of them have turned out to be frauds or vulnerable to hacks. Today even some of the most passionate crypto advocates are saying the market needs government regulation to regain trust and bring in the established financial institutions that were once the enemies of crypto.

If crypto doesn’t provide a more trustworthy alternative to traditional finance, then what’s it for? So far, its primary users seem to be people fearful of using their own government’s currency because of political or economic risk or because they want to evade law enforcement. Otherwise, its main use has been speculation—gambling on the value of the currencies themselves or digital assets, such as NFTs, purchased with the currencies.

**How to Rebuild Crypto**

I have an idea, though. When we talk about financial transactions, we’re really talking about two different things.

There’s money, a medium of exchange that allows us to buy or sell goods and services more efficiently than bartering. But to make such a medium trustworthy, it needs to be a reliable store of value over time. Otherwise you risk exchanging your valuable good or service for a token that quickly sinks in purchasing power. Indeed, it’s the inter-temporal nature of some transactions that requires the most trust.

So when we talk about money, the second thing we’re also talking about is debt—that is, transactions that are inter-temporal from the start. At the end of the first quarter of 2022, total credit to the private nonfinancial sector was more than $37 trillion in the US.

And few types of debt are more mainstream than mortgages. Back in 1920s America, buying a house might require paying half the value up front and borrowing the other half for five years. Before the US government stepped in, lenders didn’t trust buyers enough to make a 30-year loan with only 10% or 20% upfront, as is common today. Now there are more than $10 trillion worth of residential mortgages in the US.

But real estate transactions and mortgage lending are notorious for the amount and complexity of the paperwork required. Keeping track of the necessary information and processing it efficiently can be challenging. Facilitating those types of transactions—by putting essential information about properties, owners and loans on an immutable digital ledger—could make crypto indispensable.

For the loan originators, after an upfront investment in the technology, a digital record could lead to considerable savings in time and labor. Some of those savings could be passed on to the borrowers. For the mortgage applicant, automated verification of identity, income, bank account statements and the like would speed up a stressful but unavoidable process.

If established and regulated financial-services companies moved their home lending documentation on to such an ecosystem, eventually they might move myriad other services, too.

We’ve already seen some well-known companies investing in blockchain technology. Hedera Hashgraph has buy-in from some of the biggest names in technology and banking, including Boeing, Deutsche Telekom, Google, LG and Nomura. And even though JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon has called cryptocurrencies “decentralized Ponzi schemes,” he’s investing the bank’s money in a digital ledger called Onyx coin systems, which JPMorgan’s website describes as seeking “to help address the complex challenges of cross border payments, simplify clients’ liquidity funding needs and offer next generation corporate treasury services.” Could this augur a new future for crypto’s underlying technology? A highly regulated system made up of established companies transacting through a more secure digital database?

Not only do these initiatives lack the Wild West appeal of crypto’s early years, but they’re also the opposite of the totally anonymous and decentralized networks that crypto enthusiasts hoped to create. Ethereum’s website describes DeFi as “an alternative to a system that’s opaque, tightly controlled and held together by decades-old infrastructure and processes.” But Ethereum’s examples for DeFi’s current use cases—helping people take out loans without using any personal identification and enabling crypto-savvy Argentines to escape inflation—seem unlikely to scale up to the mainstream.

When I started thinking about crypto and trust, I was optimistic about the chances for a reboot of the crypto space. But as I thought more about how existing crypto platforms are organized, it seemed almost impossible to transform the culture of DeFi and NFTs into something that can truly replace existing banks and money. But the idea of moving some of our financial system to a distributed ledger might still work..

We could end up with a hybrid of three different systems of trust: trust in established brands and institutions, trust in regulatory protections and the trust created by a supposedly immutable and unhackable digital ledger. All of these have been shown to be imperfect by the Great Depression, the 2008 great financial crisis and the crypto meltdown. Maybe the combination will be less imperfect. There’s some value in that. But it’s not the future of money.""",cryptocurrency,1668874674

I have a stipend, but it's not much (high 20s, and I pay 1.3k/mo in rent...). I also have student loans from undergrad, about 30k. Really just pinching pennies here trying to make it to graduation.

I have had credit cards since I was 18. I pay them off each month, and have never missed a payment. My credit score is in the upper 700s. 

Recently, I received a job offer in a major metropolitan area. It pays about 6x what I currently make. I need to move, but cannot afford to. Relocation assistance is not offered through this position.

I went to my credit union where I have been a customer since age 12 (with a kiddo account). I asked for a personal loan for moving expenses and first/last month's rent in my new place (totals about 10k). I showed them my job offer, and detailed what I would spend the money on. I made clear my history with the credit union (I keep my savings there, and use the checking account regularly). 

I was denied, on the basis that I was asking for a 10k loan on technically a salary less than 30k. Makes sense.

I simply do not know how to move forward - if my own credit union will not loan me this money, I do not know who will without charging exorbitant interest rates. 

Is my current income truly the only consideration when making decisions about personal loans? This is quite ridiculous. I cannot stay in my current area as there are no jobs here - are highly employable graduate students really expected to take a less-than-desirable job in a LCOL area just because they cannot afford to move?

I do not have friends or family to loan me money, as even with my measly grad student stipend I make more than my parents lol.

EDIT: Some have suggested an extended stay hotel, but I have two cats, one of which is special needs. I do not have family that I trust to take care of them (a previous cat was once put down without permission by my only family with the space) and my friends do not have the space/willingness as they are mostly grad students too. I know I am being picky but I will not give them up or have them somewhere where their health will suffer.

System is brand new, not even turned on yet, still waiting for an inspection and to finalize payments. It has been on my roof for a grand total of two days. 

When they were delivering the panels to install, they came out of the back of a covered trailer, think Uhaul, one of the enclosed little ones. There wasn't any packing protection from what I could tell. 

I was outside with the installer for about 15 minutes while he gave me the down and dirty on what to expect, and so on and so forth when I noticed the sides of the panels looked a little roughed up. I asked him about it, and he assured me they were brand new panels and that it was just from transport. I had to go back inside and didn't have time to press the issue.

Now that I've had time to go up on my roof and look at the panels further, they are definitely scuffed up. Some of the damage is cosmetic along the sides of the panels. Some of the damage is on the actual generating part of the panel itself. The cells I believe they're called. 

Now I gave him the benefit of the doubt. I went up and wiped each panel down with a wet cloth and dried it to get rid of anything that could be mistaken for dirt, chalk, smudges, oil, etc. I wiped on along the sides of the panels, and on the cells to see what was just cosmetic, and what was actual damage.

[https://imgur.com/a/LDNMAhr](https://imgur.com/a/LDNMAhr)

That's a link with 59 pictures on a 20 panel install. There is cosmetic damage along the sides of almost every panel. There is damage on the cells of probably half, it not a little more. 

Now I know the damage on the cell portion of the panel is just damage on the protective layer on the top of the panel. I've seen the videos of them getting smashed with hail, run over by cars, etc. I'm not worried about the panels being functional (although, they haven't been turned on yet, so who knows). But am I in the wrong here for expecting a purchase of new panels to look new? These almost look used in some cases. 

I get some of the damage may have come from transport, or maybe even the install, but what is a reasonable expectation of wear and tear on a new install? What is a reasonable conversation to have with the installer? Do I ask them to replace the panels? Do I ask for a discount on the purchase price based on the condition the panels arrived in? Or is this normal within the business and because solar panels sit outside all day I shouldn't expect them to arrive encased in styrofoam-wrapped cardboard to protect the integrity of the panel until it hits my roof? 

Any and all information from people who have purchased a system, or who work in the business would be appreciated. I don't have any family or friends to go to regarding this. If I'm being unreasonable, I would like to know. But I can't think of any other industry or product you buy where its acceptable to have a new purchase show up looking used or damaged.

personalfinance,Is marriage a smart financial option for us?,"My partner (24) and I (30) both just got the same city job (pension, additional annuity plan, and 457 retirement plan) starting at 81k each, and by year 3 we will be at 110k base pay (not including lots of offered overtime at double pay). I get a VA disability check each month for 1041.82 and if we get married it will be 1141.83 a month (100.01 more). Other than that, it seems like we would pay the same in federal and state taxes, but what about Roth IRA income limits? Isn’t it like ~130k single but ~210k married? Would we be getting screwed on that?

Any other pros or cons financially for married couples making the same income (seems like marriage benefits are all set up for one person to sit at home)?

investing,Investing in T-bills is my calculation right?,"Hi guys

If one buys 100k USD worth of t-bills with a maturity of 4 weeks, by the end of that period I would get back the principal plus 4% of it divided by 12? That would be like 300+ dollars? Is that correct? What are the risks of doing this?

personalfinance,"Got a new job, moving to a new place, and buying a car all in the same month. Need help creating more savings in my budget.","Hello all

I have accepted a new job and will be moving to a new location and buying a car to be able to commute to work (I have been doing remote work until now) all in the next couple weeks. I created a budget for myself but it doesn't allow for as much in savings as I would want and so I thought maybe someone here could help me figure out where I can trim down or find ways to increase my savings rate. I also have a choice between a few different insurance options that I am not entirely sure how to evaluate. 

I'm 25 years old and single with a college degree in Mechanical Engineering FYI

# New Job Details: 

**Salary**: $75k 

**401(k)**: 50 cent match to the dollar up to 6% (vests at year end), plus a company retirement package where they contribute 4% of my salary to a retirement account (vests after 3 years) regardless of my own contribution.

**PTO**: 3 weeks plus national holidays, no sick days it's just clumped into PTO. 

**Medical**: I have 3 choices which are listed below. The premiums are assuming I qualify for their ""Healthy initiative"" program, which I will qualify for but the first month or two prior to qualification will have about $70 added per month to each of the premiums. I think the basic package is the best option, do you all agree?

**""My Choice"" : $44/mo**

* No deductible
* No HSA
* Copay is variable based on service ($0-$3,950 for in network) with some services requiring up to $8,400 in annual paycheck deductions to be covered. 
* $5,500 max out of pocket 
* Preventative care is fully covered for in-network
* Prescription payments can range from $20 to $250

**""Basic"" : $48/mo**

* $2,700 annual deductible
* $500 annual HSA contribution by company
* Copay is 20%
* $5,500 out of pocket maximum
* Preventative care is fully covered for in-network
* Prescription cost is 20% after deductible

**""Enhanced"" : $82/mo**

* $1,700 annual deductible
* $500 annual HSA contribution by company
* Copay is 20%
* $4,500 out of pocket maximum
* Preventative care is fully covered for in-network
* Prescription cost is 20% after deductible

# My Current Financial Situation:

**Cash on hand:** $4,500

**401(k):** $3,500 (from an old job, about 6 months worth of contributions but about a third of it isn't vested so I will lose that when I transfer it out). 

**Roth IRA:** $12,500 ($12k in contributions)

# Anticipated Pre-Tax Deductions, Taxes and Savings:

**401(k):** 6% contribution - $4,500/yr

**Health Insurance:** Basic plan - $576/yr

**Federal Income Tax:** \~20% = $15,000/yr

**State Income Tax:** \~4.75%+$90 = $3,438.75/yr

**Roth IRA Contribution:** $6,000/yr

**Money Left:** $46,500.45/yr = $3,875.04/mo

# Up Coming 1-Time Expenses: 

**Moving Cost:** \~$300 (U-Haul rental + gas)

**Overlapping Rent:** \~$400

**Total cost of lease transfer and fees:** \~$500

**Potential Double Rent Cost:** \~$1,370 (If the lease transfer doesn't happen by December)

**Security Deposit:** $1,270

**Car Down Payment (optional):** $1,000

**Total Expenses:** $2,470 to $4,840

**Cash on Hand Left:** $2,930 to $560 (accounting for paycheck and expenses in the meantime)

# Anticipated Recurring Expenses:

**Rent:** $1,270

**Utilities:** $150 fixed + electric bill = max $250

**Car I am about to buy:** $380/mo pre-approval letter (2020 Toyota Corolla LE w/ 17k miles for $23,700 after tax and fees with 1k down at 5.39% APR)

**Car Insurance:** $150/mo quote through Geico (first time car owner with no insurance history, it should go down substantially after 6 months)

**Anticipated Gas Expense:** \~$100/mo

**Therapy + Meds (ADHD):** \~$258/mo

**Anticipated Food + Going out/Weekend Expenses:** $650/mo (average of the last 3 months based on my credit card expenses, but it could drop as I have a car now so no more Uber expense and less food delivery)

**Anticipated Miscellaneous Expenses:** \~$250/mo (anything not accounted for above, like video games, subscriptions, household items, etc)

**Total Expenses:** $3,308/mo

**Surplus in Budget:** $567/mo

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

So this ended up being way longer and more detailed than I had planned (thanks ADHD lol), but that's basically my entire situation right now and all the anticipated changes and expenses coming up. 

I feel like having a surplus of only \~$500 per month is very tight for me especially because I have only accounted for retirement savings, but I would ideally like to be investing in a personal account as well as I am hoping to retire before 60. 

What do you all think about my situation and what changes can/should I make to increase my savings rate? 

Thanks in advance!",finance,1668893477
CryptoCurrency,"Why ""Easy money"" money policy for crypto is gone?","First of all I have tried to be very careful with not telling my family what to do with their money. So that’s the “number one” piece of advice I can give you. If you want people to learn about crypto, that’s always a good thing because I do think it’s gonna be in their life every day very soon, but be careful because people do get upset about their money 

As for me “easy money” policy is gone, so when your family talks about “Crypto is doing so terrible” - just be like. The arc innovation fund is down 70% the last year, all these different text docs, especially the unprofitable tech index down 80-90% and then the markets themselves are 30-40% depending on what day of the week is that. You take a look at it, so there is just less easy easy money in 2023, we have this high inflation problem, the FED is taking money out of the market in order to try to get the inflation numbers down. We also have crazy energy prices, we have a geopolitical crisis in Europe and so this is not just a crypto problem. 

The next couple years, especially 2023, feel very confident, we’re going to have less liquidity in here. A lot of people are calling for a recession next year so I just think that this is the state of a play right now and it’s kind of mean to pick on crypto in particular inside of that broader market context, it’s not just our industry, it’s literally everybody.",cryptocurrency,1668896086
personalfinance,I am an idiot and i need some financial advice,"I know im stupid and irresponsible with how i handled my money untill now. I learned my lesson and i want to do right. I need advice to change my situation to the best possible outcome i could have. I dont need sympathy or hate, just trying to make things right.

I am 26 years old and in march of this year i bought a car that was WAAAAAAAAAAY too much as my first car. I have a net salary of 2800 per month and i made a big mistake of buying a car that was way out of my budget. I took out a loan of 36 000 euros over a period of 7 years totaling to 465 per month. In my head i wanted to keep the monthly cost of the loan as low as possible, and save 500 per month towards paying the car off in full after a couple years.

Somewhere in august i realized that i had made a very dumb mistake by buying this car, because i would not be able to save for a house for as long as i had this car. Basically every penny i saved had to go to this car because getting a house loan while having a car loan does not go together, so i needed to pay it off ASAP.

I had decided to sell this car and buy something smaller, i sold it and lost a total of 1000 euros on it. Now i was without a car and while looking around i found a very cool car, but it was 13 500. I didnt have this money saved up, and i thought that maybe i can close the 36k loan, and take a smaller loan that i can pay off in a year and be done with it. So i call my contact at the loan office and he says to me that if you were to do that you will get a worse interest rate because the forst one was less than 3 years old and this new one is from 2017. He literally told me to just keep paying the loan, and buying the other car with the cash i got from selling the first car. Obviously this is NOT ALLOWED but in my head i was like what the fuck, who cares as long as i pay it right? So i did it...

I bought the car and im not gonna lie i love it, even more so than the more expensive one. The car did have issues in the beginning that needed to be fiixed, and that cost me around 3k total. So this car cost me 16 500.

So now i have a debt of 36 000, with 19500 in my bank account and a car i really like.

I want to get out of this situation, i dont know how i didnt realize what i was working myself into, but here i am... And some advice is appreciated.

I found a garage that is willing to buy the car for 12 000. This would mean i need to save 4500 before being able to close the loan, so 5 months as i can save 600 per month and my montly loan payment is around 400 towards the total (465 with interest). Then i can save another 3-5 months and buy an older car and just use it till it dies. So lets say in 10 months i will be debt free and have my own car.

The other option i see is keep this car, save the 400+600 monthly for 18 months, pay off the loan and have a car i actually love. But this would mean i lose out on 8 months, so around 8k compared to the first plan. 

What to do, any other option im not seeing?",finance,1668897409
investing,Long term Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) may be a good Pivot play and cash-protector in the meantime,"New long position: 22-year TIPS (CUSIP 912810RL4 ) yielding 1.8%. TIPS currently have the highest real yield in 13 years. While not as high as 10yr TIPS's original \~2% yield, this may be about the best we get this cycle. [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Wvcx](https://t.co/z6Y5tw3dsq)

Upside:

1. Bond price appreciation once Fed eases to fight recession instead of inflation.
2. In the meantime, most reasonable return of cash from treasuries arguably since 2007 (when 1yr was higher than trailing CPI). [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=Wxgh](https://t.co/A6uUMkoK35)

Downside:

1. During periods of high inflation, real yield will not cover taxes on the bond's inflation adjustment.
2. Bond price depreciation if Fed fights inflation Volcker-style.
3. Bond price depreciation if Fed shrinks balance sheet to the point of price deflation. 

I chose a long TIPS (at least 10yr) for the biggest upside in price appreciation from falling rates. From these I selected the TIPS with the highest real yield to maximize cash return in the meantime.

While I don't think the Fed is done hiking, there seems to be a growing consensus that further Fed hikes in the face of weakening economic data will further invert the yield curve, rather than raising long-term rates.

Background:

Philip Jagd summarized an article about the prospects on inflation subsiding: “Reverting to 3% inflation, the upper bound for benign sustained inflation, is easy from 4%, hard from 6%, and very hard from 8% or more. Above 8%, reverting to 3% usually takes 6 to 20 years, with a median of over 10 years.” [https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/965-history-lessons](https://www.researchaffiliates.com/publications/articles/965-history-lessons)",finance,1668899631

personalfinance,Confused on next steps… I have a general plan but not a solid plan.,"Hello everyone! 

I have been viewing posts in this subreddit for quite some time and I think someone here can provide me with good advice! 

I know everyone here comments it’s hard to give advice without knowing your history or numbers so here’s my general info and numbers.

I am a 23(F) in LCOL area l live in Ohio. I graduate with my bachelors next month in accounting. 

DEBT AND SAVINGS: Credit cards, car, and private student loan paid off. That totaled $35,000 approximately. I just finished the private student loan late October. I have $2200 in local income tax I owe that I am paying on. I owe $60k in federal student loans. (part of the things I need advice on). I had to deplete my once $7k emergency fund because of an emergency surgery but I am at $1,600 EF now and still saving and now I want $10k emergency savings.Also saving $5k for an apartment. I have already bought apartment items already throughout the year. All I need is furniture ,wifi, utilities cut on, and etc. 

INCOME AND EXPENSES: One of the areas I need help on because I want to work one job that pays enough. I work two jobs full time is $22/hr and part time is $10/hr. Long story short I took out the max of federal loans and picked up second job to only pay for tuition. Tuition was paid with my money solely after I got that private student loan. My net income is $3,000 from both jobs. I want this net pay at one job. My second job I work at my school so it’s not exhausting work but it’s exhausting working 2 jobs and with the winter months coming up and no longer having a parking pass to have access to closer parking to where I work, it doesn’t feel worth it anymore. My previous full time job was $17/hr so I’m making income increasing progress. My total expenses because I live with my parents is $500. So I have $2500 excess for my goals. I’m on the waitlist for an apartment and my rough estimate of excess money monthly when I move out is $1400,if I keep both jobs but I don’t want to. But I want to keep $3k net income.I was planning on using $500/month to investing in my Roth. Idk what to use the other $900 for. 

Most people suggest working in public accounting but the work is exhausting and with my history of working two jobs I don’t want to keep exhausting myself. Also family is toxic, otherwise I would have stayed longer to save and pay down debt. Advice on salary and job title I should look at to net $3,000 or more? Advice on what to do next financially after paying off taxes, and saving up EF? What payment plan to pick for federal student loans that has low monthly payment I can afford? (I will always pay extra but to be safe and not miss payments I want something doable just in case I come on hard times plus as you can see I don’t make much)",finance,1668959585

CryptoCurrency,A Deeper Trace Analysis of what the FTX Hacker account is actually doing: Tons of swaps and trying to exit,"####**Intro and TL;DR**

You've probably seen the news about the FTX hacker account.

**There is so much going in this account that anything you think is happening is probably done to hide his tracks.** Dozens of tokens and DeFi swap have been used. Some tokens have been sent over Polygon PoS and Bitcoin bridges. PAXG seemed to be his favorite token by far for token laundering before that was blocked. Since then, he has created at least 11 addresses trying to escape everywhere.

These are all the tokens he's been swapping to:

I wouldn't trust anything posted by the media or random Twitter posts unless they're citing experts. This should be done by a professional trace analyzer because they have specialized tools for tracing this.

**I do not believe the hacker is related to the Bahamian government. These transactions are much too random, chaotic, and swap for too many random token.** If it is the Bahamian government, then they're totally letting SBF create chaos with it.

AFAICT, the hacker is not trying to sell ETH for BTC. I'm guessing he's trying to exit using whatever exchange or swap that hasn't yet blacklisted him. PAXG was the weak link on Nov 12. It's now $60M worth of ETH to WBTC and renBTC, which he's using to exit to BTC mainnet.

**Update**: [ZachXBT mentioned](https://nitter.net/zachxbt/status/1591475246250733568) that there are **multiple groups** with their hands in the cookie jar. There are several whitehat addresses, but this ""0x59...32b"" address is almost certainly a blackhat. That's why there is so much confusion about whether it's the Bahamian government or the group that Kraken knows. There are multiple groups working on different addresses.

####**Here's my best attempt at an amateur trace analysis**

**There are at least 11 FTX hacker addresses**, most of which were created on the Nov 12. One last one was created today.

**Main address**: https://etherscan.io/address/0x59abf3837fa962d6853b4cc0a19513aa031fd32b

- **History**
  - This one's been around for 8 days since Nov 12
  - It's been growing ETH. Started with 160k ETH. Grew to 200k ETH  on Nov 15 and then to 250k ETH on Nov 19. 50k ETH has been swapped or transferred out today.
  - On the first day, it was sent out to 26 different addresses.
  - Apparently, he found out that PAXG swaps were the weakest link and was able to swap to $60M of it.
  - Since then, it has stayed quiet (other than for shitcoin transfers) until today. There was 1 lone Tx on Nov 15 for token approval for [DAI on CoW Protocol](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x7b863b03815cc6ea7b1406d6d8dbea37b15c8eb8471d7c1c46f2126e38ab0f52)
  - Suddenly today, it has become active again
- **Current balance**
  - 200k ETH, down from 250k ETH yesterday. that's a difference of about $60M USD worth of ETH that went elsewhere.
  - $14M of PAXG
  - 70+ random shit tokens. Some were sent by others to insult the owner. Some were swapped into by the owner.
- **Nov 12 activity**
  - This guy is an absolute DeFi degenerate. He's possibly testing for blacklists on his first day or trying to exit as fast as he can. He used over a dozen different swaps.
  - Did tons of token approval. I stopped listing the duplicates on different dApps. For example, he tested approvals for PAXG on at least a dozen swaps. And these are just what I can see on the blockchain.
  - There is:  [stETH](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xc5ae2cd094170c18d0aa82ad14e5fbb7a53b3b86ccfc881fb4aaaa83f5cfb69f), [USDT](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb6b498e674fbaae3efdbfc1ffb5d2a3ac3549161ab2118088017d2cebbd6340d), [LINK](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb4e3b44657a4546ca967650d2b8f8af16829d93883b3a37fbfa193bd47d49716), [USDP](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x22dc8550be7041b34818a342abef481c5517288d89c1df4dfd0dfaf5f579a5e7), LDO, WBTC, SUSHI, YFI, 1INCH, UNI, LINK, MATIC, PAXG, SHIB, AAVE, APE, PAXG, SNX

####**Shit token transfers to famous people's addresses**

You might have noticed that the accounts are sending lots of random shit tokens like Twitter World Cup Inu, FTTCash, and FTX Sucks to random famous people's accounts. These are actually spoofed tokens: https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/spoof-tokens-on-ethereum-c2ad882d9cf6. You can tell because the account initiating the transfer is not the FTX Hacker account.

Here's [an example of one](https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5ef187511fcb9b8a31c68f936ea37935ed4b98ea7db622a08b71d27ba9d15d66)

Anyways, I'm just one person tracing this for 2 hours. I'll leave it to the professionals like Chainanalysis to do a better job.

One of the takeaways is that even if you blacklist one account, it's hard to actively trace the other accounts they're going to and actively block them.

**Update**: [ZachXBT](https://nitter.net/zachxbt/status/1594353611554832388) has a great thread on this he posted an hour ago. Covers a lot of same topics, but also includes some details I missed, like how there were multiple parties sending to different accounts.

**Update 2 - Spoofed tokens**: The sent shitcoins are spoofed tokens meant to make it look like the FTX Hacker sent them. But they're actually smart contracts designed so that someone else could transfer them while tricking the block explorer. The way you can tell is that the FTX Hacker account is not the address initiating the token transfer, and I should've noticed that: https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/spoof-tokens-on-ethereum-c2ad882d9cf6",cryptocurrency,1668964917

Drowning in interest, need help/advice","So I have been working on and off for years, tried to go back to school in 2019, covid, essentially added 30k of debt to myself. Had a suicide attempt after that, lived off my credit card for a year in deep depression and have really given up for the most part.

A large part of the the depression is from the debt. On my 31.5k personal line of credit (which is maxed out), I pay approx $205 monthly with a 7.51% interest rate. On my credit card debt of 13.2k, I pay approx $230 monthly in interest at a rate of..20%? Couldn't even find it, that shows how little I know about finances

So every month I pay $400+ in interest alone. When working (minimum wage in Canada is $15/hr) full time, I bring home approx $1600. Rent+utilities+internet = $700. Phone, groceries, pets, bills, life and small emergencies usually leave me with less than $200 of floating money each month. At this rate i could pay off approx $1000 per year from my credit card debt for 13 years and then start in on my line of credit. This will never happen, I'll be lucky to see the new year haha

What should I do? I can't afford to survive like this with inflation, much less get any part of my life, including my mental health, in order without thousands of dollars for therapy and treatment. I go to my monthly meeting with the counsellor my ""free Canadian Health Care"" gets me, and I can't afford health insurance in order to pay for antidepressants (Blue cross is $120/month, pills about 40 WITH insurance). I had considered filing for bankruptcy but apparently thats just a different kind of debt in Canada nowadays and you still have to pay back most of the debt. I had considered fleeing the country but figured I should ask for advice first

I don't need sympathy, I need financial advice so please don't provide one without the other. People have been giving me best wishes and telling me to keep going for 30 years and I've done that, I don't need to hear that anymore.

personalfinance,Questions about a mortgage arrangement with my dad,"My dad is about to retire and he lives in a country that deals with hyperinflation due to government's stupid policies. The local currency lost quite a bit of value against USD in the past \~10 years and he is struggling to find a way to invest his retirement savings. Stock markets in his country are not a viable option and he is looking more than just keeping his savings in a savings account.

Since the local currency has been doing so bad against USD, he wants to keep his investments in USD, which limits his options. He looked at some investment options in US like buying a condo and renting it out. However, he is not the biggest fan of all the responsibilities it comes with.

I think this is where I come in to the picture. I live in US as a permanent resident and about to buy my first house. Last year, I signed for a house in a new development and it is about to be ready. It costs \~$450K and I am planning to put 30% down (leaves me a good amount of emergency fund) and get a 30-year mortgage for the rest of it. My dad's idea is, instead of me loaning that much from a bank, I could loan \~$200K from him with a similar interest rate, and the rest of it (\~$120K) from the bank. I liked the idea because instead of losing the money that I would pay as interest, we can keep it in family. It sounds like being a landlord without all the responsibilities for him.

I think it is important to note that the money that he is thinking about loaning me is not something he relies on for the short term. He will probably continue to work for another year or two, he does not have any debt (no mortgage or car payments), has government pension and universal healthcare. He was lucky to build enough wealth before the shit hit the fan.

However, I have some questions about the arrangement I described above.

Would receiving $200K to be used to buy a house create any tax implications for us in USA? (My dad is neither a US citizen nor a resident of US)

What would be the best way to transfer such a big amount of money internationally with minimal fees?

Would that money be accepted by the mortgage loaner?

And the most important question; does it sound like a good idea?",finance,1668977844

&amp;#x200B;

We currently are paying 2.5% on a 15-year-fixed, which is pretty incredible. We were paying extra on the mortgage at first, but then as the rate of inflation increased dramatically, we withheld making extra payments on the principal.

Our mortgage is currently with Citizens Bank; they were not our original broker, but ours was transferred to them.

Before I even start, everyone needs to know that I'm terrible at handling my personal finances. Saving money has always been a problem for me but I've been trying to be better.

So about a year ago, I took out a loan of around $9k. Missed a couple of payments throughout the year and with the interest rate being extremely high, I now owe almost $20k. After talking it through with the loan company, I managed to reduce my payments to a manageable amount of $200/biweekly. Where I'm from, the cost of living is extremely high and I don't make as much so I opted for the lowest biweekly payment possible. 

So, making all of my payments on time, today I just find out I'm somehow $1k overdue on my account. Where the hell did this payment  come from? I've been saving and making on time payments, and somehow this still happens. 

So now I really need a plan to get rid of this lingering debt and move forward with my life. Any advice on growing to become financially stable would be greatly appreciated.

gaming,What is your 10/10 game?,"Not to long ago I had this discussion with some friends and I really had to think hard about what game to choose for my 10/10 title. 


For this fabled 10/10 rating I didn't want the game to just be the latest AAA title which shines because of better graphics, a bigger map, more features only to be dwarfed by upcoming games that deliver more.


So I've played all kinds of games through out my life. Some bad, some good and some that are excellent. Some that made me laugh, some that made me cry but only a few that I'd say to be ""timeless"". Games that I'd play even in years to come without thinking ""well this aged poorly"" or ""the newer installments of this franchise are doing it better"". 


And the first game that came to my head was f'ing ""Mario Kart 64"". 


This answer is probably influenced by a heavy dose of nostalgia, but boy was/is that a great game. And to this day I'd prefer it over any other installment of the franchise or game in the ""racing"" genre. There is not a single thing I'd want to change. It has a competitive nature, memorable tracks, a great soundtrack, fun but fair RNGesus and skips that required some cojones.


The fun I had with this game, the tears I cried when going from first place to 7th in the blink of an eye just short of the finish line, the ""pride and accomplishment"" I've felt listening to the ""rainbow road"" soundtrack after winning against friends. This is truly my 10/10 game.

I have no other debts. I have this loan because i want to stay liquid cash.

I can get 4% on my 123k cash via Treasuries which would drop the effective interest rate on the loan to 4.5%.

investing,Explain this analogy for why NPV of perpetuity is C/r?,"Hello! I understand how to get C/r by simplifying the infinite geometric series sum, but I came across an analogy from a book that I'm trying to wrap my head around.

**It goes like this:** Say that you put $100 in a bank that pays 5% interest per year. After the first year, you have $105. You withdraw the $5 and reinvest $100. After the second year, you have $105, and again, you withdraw $5 and reinvest $100, repeat forever.

In essence, this is equivalent to receiving a perpetuity with payment C=$5 and interest rate r=0.05. Since the bank is ""selling"" us the perpetuity for $100 (we create it by making the initial deposit of $100), the analogy claims that by the Law of One Price, the ""price"" of the perpetuity is $100. The NPV of the perpetuity is therefore its cost, or $100 = C/r.

**EDIT:** I see, $100=NPV(perpetuity) because we created the perpetuity from $100 in the present. Basically what it says on the tin",finance,1668993895
personalfinance,Should I use cash or take out a loan?,"Hi,

So I am going into my second to last semester of college and was wondering about something. I applied for student loans and only have an offer for $5,500 in direct federal loans. The rate is currently at 4.99%. With scholarships and everything I probably won’t even need all of this amount but I am wondering if it is an okay idea to take the loan out and keep my cash? I would have around $7.5k in cash that I want to keep because financial freedom and just anxiety about cash. 

I want to know if this is an okay idea. I’m majoring in CS and so my career outlook would be fine seeing that this isn’t a big amount. Plus, I could probably pay it off as I am expected to get a big amount in my tax refund. 

I currently have no debt. I am pretty split on what to do, I was wanting secondary opinions about this before I make any decisions.

Edit: this is a federal subsidized loan. 
Edit 2: one of my other major reason is to build credit via a loan because I have no prior debt. Additionally, the govt pays interest til I graduate. I plan on paying off small amounts each month thru my internship while I study.",finance,1668998025

So far I have invested around $16K in getting my Private Pilot License. And I plan to get my Commercial Pilot License as well which will cost in total of PPL to $80-90K. So far I have been paying just from my paychecks. But now I have life-events coming up and getting engaged next year and married in 2024. My partner is onboarded with my flying career of future commercial pilot. Here is what I need some guidance with:

I need to save up more for upcoming events, engagement/wedding and possibly moving to FL(No state tax, yay!) all within Two years. My income/investing stats are below. I am wondering if I should take a personal loan(6%+ interest rate) v/s Auto Equity Loan(MY car is worth $14K, fully paid off), Or a 401K loan(planing to change employer in a year). I need a loan of around $20k for now and I am hoping to change job and get another $20k bump to my salary so rest of the training will be paid off from the paycheck.

Salary: $140k+Retirement Investment(401K, tradition IRA): $60kTaxable investment: $30kStocks(vested+unvested): $50kSavings+CDs+Emergency funds: $65KPlus I have $0 other Debt. Not planning on buying a home until next 3 years at least.

My monthly bills is around $1000-$1500/month for Flying(This also varies, It will reduce If I fly less, increase If I fly more). I can pay it off from my Pay checks but I rather want to save up a portion of that money for upcoming life-events, and invest a part of it mutual funds and ETFs in regular brokerage account and don't want to break-in to my savings for engagement and weddings. Also, this will be career change, not just a random hobby. I am highly dedicated for it.

So, Should I take a loan for up to 6% interest rate from Auto equity/ Personal Loans/401K loan? and save and invest OR Keep paying pay check to pay check and save/invest the little I can. Sorry for the long post. Hope someone will read it. Thank you :)",finance,1669002174
personalfinance,Seeking advice and a reality check on paying down debts while supporting a vacation,"Hello Esteemed Redditors,

&amp;#x200B;

I have found you all to be very level headed and helpful in evaluating things. I know that when you are too close to an issue, you may not be able to see it properly, so I defer to you all. I consider myself fairly competent in finances and am aiming to balance the continued repayment of debt with having money aside for a decently long vacation while I am able to get 4 weeks off in a row approved.

Since I asked things awhile ago, I have bought a house and taken on renters.

So let me talk about my cash in and out first.

Income:

\- \~$87,000 a year salary, of which I see $48,396 after taxes and deductions. This includes all insurances, pension, 401k, $200 to an account for entertainment, and all taxes.

\- I then also have about $1100 in rent per month coming from renting out spare space in the house.

So in total, an average month is about $4822, with two months a year getting an additional paycheck of $1861.

My expenses are:

&amp;#x200B;

|Entry|Cost|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Mortgage|1308.93|Includes escrow|
|Car Loan|235.58|Repayment is years off|
|Water|50||
|Gas/Heat|90|In winter\*|
|Electric|90|We are heavy on power use|
|Car Insurance|120|Wondering if I can lower this.|
|Subs|90|Includes a lot of things, from streaming to patreon to sirius to onstar|
|Internet|63|1 Gig internet, may get better deal by changing.|
|Gasolie|80|Do not drive much and work from home|

In addition to those, I have some debts I am paying off:

|Entry|Balance|Interest|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Citi|$5513.27|0%|Until September 2023, then 18%|
|Best Buy|$2243.08|0%|Will be paid in December|
|Credit Union CC|3966|3%|Until March 2023, then 10%|
|Loan|$10082.22|0%|Until August 2023, deferred interest if not paid off. HVAC loan, taken out in April.|
|Private Student Loan|$5213|1.25%|Auto pay of around $90|

Most things are set at minimum except Best Buy, so I pay around $1100 toward these debts. None of these balances are building and I have been paying them down for months. They were charged during renovations when I bought the house as we kept finding things that needed repair or replacement. We believe the house is in sound shape now.

Monthly Total: $4822 - 2128.51 - 1100 = $1593 I can re-budget toward debts or put aside for trip.

Now, I have a vacation coming up in March and do not want to feel like I can do nothing.  I know that ""pay your debts"" is the obvious information, but I am specifically looking for opinions on how to balance the enjoy life factor with fiscal responsibility. The options I am assessing are:

1. Possibly try to pay as much as possible before February, then use one of the below options. The issue for me is I need cash in hand, I cannot substitute a credit card for expenses on vacation. So I have to have a small bank on me/available, I cannot wait till the last second to try to get cash. I'd like to have $4000-$5000 or so for going a little crazy and traveling to neighboring countries as well.
2. Use the empty credit cards with balance transfer offers to move things from February/March 2023 to early 2024, using the 12 month transfer offer (3% transfer fee, but no interest). I would pay the HVAC loan off as priority, then the citi card. I believe I can afford all of that in time.
3. Take a loan, could be home equity, personal, or a loan against my 401K. The question here is on the loan, not the exact type, but feel free to comment on type as well.  I would put some of the loan aside for the trip and use the rest to pay almost all other things off immediately.
4. Your suggestion here. The goal is pay things off within the next 2-3 years while not sacrificing quality of life. I considered doing home equity for extra and doing some home improvements as well, but unsure if I want to do that right now.

Cash flow wise, anytime I push things out makes it easier on me. I also get raises twice a year and a bonus, so future me always makes more and it is therefore easier to cover, though interest may be getting paid as a result.  I like the certainty of the loan option, but know that is a much higher interest rate.

I previously posted I was going abroad for work and I am not longer taking an effective pay cut in the process and will now be looking at a per diem account, giving more funds than usual. I am not worried about paying bills during that trip in the start of 2024.

Thank you and sorry for the long post. I want to be thorough enough to give the information you may want, but also reflect, roughly, my total position.

&amp;#x200B;

EDIT: The markdown tables didn't work, so replaced with ""fancy"".

EDIT2: Noted that I am not a regular credit spender and this was all one off. The balances have been falling for months. I do not generally use a credit card, but I used them to finance at 0% so I could pay the labor in cash.  No further work is needed.

EDIT3: I have $6000 in cash on hand, that is kind of important. I can clearly pay something off, I just haven't done so yet.  Somehow I wrote a novel and missed a lot of important information.",finance,1669002825

CryptoCurrency,Low Time Preference is Key,"Time preference simply means the extent to which an individual is inclined to favor his/her present well-being or current consumption over future well-being and consumption. This means that someone with a high time preference is more concerned about catering to his present needs than those of the future. On the other hand, an individual with low time preference or the ability to delay gratification places more priority on needs of the future.

But what does “lower your time preference,” popular parlance among Bitcoiners, actually mean? Commonly attributed to Saifedean Ammous, the polarizing author who penned The Bitcoin Standard, lowering one's time preference translates to thinking long-term and valuing the future over the present.

https://medium.com/the-capital/bitcoin-time-preference-how-sound-money-contributes-to-a-prosperous-society-829f49b92c1d

Bitcoin's life cycle is characterized by periods of violent volatility. Its short to medium term price action is not an indicator of its longer term price trajectory. Its price today has no bearing on its price 10+ years from now.

With a low time preference, we're not expecting to sell in a period when BTC's price has declined. We're allowed to treat these periods as opportunities to accumulate. For some, this is the first dramatic swing to the downside and they may be discouraged but it's normal for BTC. It will be obvious when to scale in and out of BTC when its cycles become more natural to the investor. There is no stress if you believe in the long term growth and increase in demand of BTC long term. It's carving a permanent place for itself in the global asset market.",cryptocurrency,1669005434
solar,Quoted $3/kW on 8kW system before financing fees.,"Hey all. Rushing into solar due to NEM 3.0 like many others. And kind of getting lost in it all. 

We don't have the cash up front. We likely won't be able to pay it off smoothly for about 10 years.

We received a proposal for an 8kW system (20 IQ8M inverters and Panasonic panels) at $23,793. Roof is about 12 to 14 years old and will cost about $21,000. It can all be lumped together in financing and sales reps say we can get the 30% incentives on the total.

My first question is... Without financing were sitting at ~$3/kW. Is this a good quote?

With a 2.99% interest financing they have some hefty dealer fees (about $12k) and it ends at ~$4.45/kW.

With a 7.99% interest (fee about $1k) we land at a cleaner $3.10/kW.

I've done extensive math and budgeting and I am confident we could pay it off after 10 years assuming simple salary raises based on cost of living increases.

26. Elon’s going to make the blue check mark accessible to all for $8 (or the purchasing power equivalent in your country) and also reward content creators. This could have significant effects on crypto ecosystems like Cardano that rely heavily on Twitter.

34. The U.S. Fed gave us another very unsurprising 75 basis point hike in the federal funds rate today (Nov. 2). This brings us to 3.75-4% which is the highest rate we’ve seen since January 2008.

35. Apparently, Twitter has a program called Birdwatch that could be used to add “readers notes” to misleading tweets about Cardano. Maybe we should look into this to combat the psyops against Cardano. [https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1587774389264973826](https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1587774389264973826)

38. There is speculation that the November announcement might be the actual building of a PEReDi (Privacy Enhanced Regulated Distributed) CBDC. A CBDC that isn’t a panopticon does sound better than the alternative.

44. The way they’re currently structured and operating, a lot of DAOs may get smashed as regulators will just view them as on-chain corporations who sold early stage securities to non-accredited investors.

49. There’s a whole crypto twitter drama happening right now with the finances of FTX and Alameda that has apparently led to Binance announcing that they will sell their FTX Token holdings (Nov. 6).

51. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table. [https://twitter.com/thiccythot\_/status/1589022227437039616](https://twitter.com/thiccythot_/status/1589022227437039616) [https://twitter.com/ravanave/status/1589264438087266305](https://twitter.com/ravanave/status/1589264438087266305)

63. Here’s a nice video of Charles crushing the kid from The OC (who is now a middle aged crypto critic) along with some other person who says that “crypto has ruined lives.” The actor basically thinks that every cryptocurrency is just a security.

75. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing. [https://twitter.com/iamshamdol/status/1591933841337638913](https://twitter.com/iamshamdol/status/1591933841337638913)

79. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US.

86. Vitalik is worried about bugs in SC code and “most worried” about hacks of ZK-Rollups. I believe it’s obvious that ETH ZK-Rollups will generally be DnPs (“deposit and pray”).

When I was 18 I dropped out of a school which cost 50k/yr and it was thankfully early enough that they refunded everything. I went to community college and transferred. My current school costs 15k a year.

I recently had some mental health issues and took a year off school to get help. I live with my parents and I don’t pay rent since they already paid off their mortgage. I work two jobs, each around 15 hrs a week, so I make 2.2k before taxes a month and I spend about 160 on healthcare and 100 on personal expenses. I bring home a lot of free food as one of my jobs is at a cafe and I close, and my parents have a garden so my grocery bill is low. I am on my parents’ insurance but have to pay for copays myself.

I have 15k of debt, will be eligible for 7.5k in federal loans next year and don’t want to take out private loans. I need 7.5k for tuition and 9k for 9 months of living expenses. I estimate that I will be working 30 hours a week and making 2.2k/mo for the next two months and making 1.3/mo for seven months after that which would be, after my expenses, saving 1.8k and 900 respectively.

Does anyone have a useful guide/info on how to set up my W4 going into 2023 if I wanted to have little to no federal tax withheld knowing I will be getting an $11,000 tax credit when filing for 2023? We will lbe getting our panels installed in March 2023.

If I end up financing with a HELOC, and rates being so high it seems like it would save money on interest to take the money I would be paying in federal tax each month, and put it toward the HELOC instead of waiting 12+ months to file for my refund. 

I would only be looking to do this on my W4 and leave my wife's alone. This would get us most of the way to ""breaking even"" with an expected small refund in 2023.

stocks,The US Treasury Yield Curve Recession Indicator is Flashing Red,"From the article:


Even as stock investors cheer signs of inflation peaking, the bond market’s best-known predictor of recessions is showing its clearest signal yet that there is trouble ahead for the US economy.

It’s known in Wall Street lingo as an inverted yield curve, and in recent days it has moved to its most extreme levels since the 1982 recession thanks to a big drop in long-term bond yields. When this dynamic has been in place over the last two decades, in each case a recession has followed. (For a look at the history of yield curves and recessions, see our earlier story here.)

While an inverted US Treasury yield curve isn’t known as a predictor of how deep or how long a recession may last, or even when a recession will begin, market watchers say the current message is unmistakable.

""Historically, when you get a sustained inversion like this […] it’s a very reliable indicator of a recession coming,"" says Duane McAllister, a senior portfolio manager at US firm Baird Advisors.

That leaves many market observers saying the real question isn’t whether there will there be a recession, but what it will look like. Will it be shallow or deep? Short or drawn out?

Money managers and economists are wrestling with these questions. Many say the outlook is highly uncertain against a backdrop of recent economic data painting a somewhat conflicting picture. On the one hand, inflation has started to come down from 40-year highs, which should give the Federal Reserve the ability to slow the pace of interest-rate increases.

However, inflation remains extremely hot despite its recent easing. At the same time, job growth and consumer spending remain robust. In fact, the Atlanta Fed’s GDPNow forecast, a running estimate of economic growth, is clocking in an extremely strong 4.2% rate of growth for the fourth quarter. Those indicators suggest the Fed can’t afford to stop raising rates too early and risk embedding higher inflation into the economy, analysts say.

personalfinance,Double check my Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) thought process please,"Bought a house summer ‘21 with 5% down so PMI is required on my mortgage but the thing is my loan agreement says that PMI is for the life of the loan because it is FHA loan (this means it will not be removed when I have enough equity, I must refinance to remove it). I thought it was an OK deal and I would look in to refinancing out of it asap. Fast forward now interest rates are 3x mine as I approach 20% equity in my house. I’d be crazy to refinance now, right?  

$308k balance  
2.45% interest rate  
$213/month PMI  
213x12months=$2556.6/year (this is 0.83% of $308k) so that is effectively 2.45+.83=3.28% which is much better than the 7% interest people are paying right now. (As principal gets lower that 0.83% will grow, I get that). So, I shouldn’t consider refinancing until interest(2.45%)+(PMI%) is greater than current interest rates I could refinance to.  

Am I doing this right? I thought I was getting super scammed with $213 PMI but because interest rates went up, it’s OK? at least for now?

personalfinance,"Having issues with attempted identity theft; locked down my credit, what steps to take next?","I hope this is the right sub for this question.  Sorry for the length! 

&amp;#x200B;

I have been dealing with attempted identity theft. I say attempted because luckily so far everything has been caught before anything happened, and I thought I was in the clear since it had been almost a year since anything happened, but now it is starting up again. 

&amp;#x200B;

Backstory: Last year, mid summer of 2021, we received a letter at work from unemployment that a claim was being filed against us. Imagine my shock as I opened the letter (I was dealing with all of the pandemic claims) and saw that the claimant was me. I immediately called the state unemployment office and let them know we received a fraudulent claim using my name and asked what we needed to do. They let me know nothing had been paid out since the claim hadn't been approved yet, and locked my account with the state. They gave me the state and federal websites to report unemployment fraud/theft, and I followed all of the instructions and filled everything out. They weren't able to tell me much, except that the person had used my SSN and the name of my company to apply, but had some other info wrong, which had already sent up red flags and why the claim was sent to us to be verified. They  would not give me more info. 

&amp;#x200B;

We still had to attend a virtual hearing to dismiss the claim, and the other party never showed, so it was closed on their end but they told me the fraud claim was still being investigated and they would reach out to me if needed. I never heard anything after that, but in some of the paperwork they sent, I did discover that the person that put the claim in was halfway across the country. 

&amp;#x200B;

At this time, I called all three credit bureaus and locked my credit down. There was nothing on any of the reports that was fishy, which was good. I also signed up for the Experian credit monitoring service basic plan that was supposed to watch my report, check the 'dark web' for leaked info, etc. 

&amp;#x200B;

Everything was quiet after that, and after the last year passed, I thought I was in the clear. Then two weeks ago, I received a letter in the mail from Ally bank, letting me know that they were denying my request to open an account as they couldn't verify my identity, and if I had any questions or did not request this account to call them. Since I hadn't tried opening any accounts, I took the letter and immediately called them. They said that someone tried to open about account and used my name, social, and DOB, and it was done online, but some information that was give set off their fraud warning and that is why they denied it and sent me the letter. They wouldn't tell me what info was wrong/false, or what set off their alert, but they DID send the denial letter to my home address, which is one I don't normally give out.  I use a PO Box for all of my mail, and the only thing I use my home address for is verification on my credit cards and such (but even the statements go to my mailing address).  So this is another upsetting fact. 

&amp;#x200B;

Ally also didn't tell what TYPE of account was attempted to be opened. She said they could not share that. 

&amp;#x200B;

I checked with Experian, as they never sent me an alert, and they were extremely unhelpful and pretty much said they couldn't figure out why I wasn't alerted but they saw nothing on my credit. I'm wondering if it never made it to the credit bureaus because Ally's internal process caught it?

&amp;#x200B;

I mentioned canceling their service and was told that was the only way to lock my credit through them. I believe this is wrong, as Equifax and Transunion let me lock without a service. So that is one thing I need to deal with. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don't even know if this is connected to the fraudulent unemployment claim or not, but it seems too coincidental that I have never had an issue before and now I have had two in the last 16 months. I've worked hard to have great credit and this is terrifying to me to have someone out there with my info, and also not knowing how they are getting it.

&amp;#x200B;

Now I am just wondering what my next steps are. My credit is still locked down, but is there anything else I should be doing? I went to [identitytheft.gov](https://identitytheft.gov) and went through that process again, but I feel like there should be more?",finance,1669072451

I've seen comments on reddit mention how they will sometimes create new account types just so they can reduce rates for existing customers while still advertising a high rate. I don't want to have to keep up with this, so that could be a reason for me to go with Ally. But does Ally do the same thing, or do they consistently just have one main HYSA? Is one less likely to reduce interest rates on existing accounts in favor of new accounts types, or are they both pretty much the same in this category? TIA",finance,1669078927

personalfinance,Having more than one savings account? Thoughts?,"Hi Redditors!

Just wanted to start off by saying my knowledge in financing is elementary, so please bear with me! I currently have a checking and savings account with my local bank, both of which only offer 0.01% interest rate. I plan to keep my checking account and leave $5,000 in my savings account (as emergency funds) with them for easy access, but am interested in moving the rest of my money to another bank...or two possibly.

I recently received an email from Discover about a $200 bonus if I deposit a minimum of $25,000 within 30 days of opening the account. Discover also currently has 3% interest, which makes the offer more appealing. Here are my questions:

* Should I deposit the rest of my money solely into this Discover savings account? OR
* Should I deposit the $25,000 minimum into the Discover savings account and put the rest in another bank that has a similar or higher interest rate to establish a relationship with them? 

Some things to consider:

* I got the it Chrome Card a year ago, so I already have an existing relationship with Discover
* Starting January, I will be attending graduate school, so I won't be working at all
* I have thought about opening a CD, but in case I need to access the money to help pay tuition, I won't be able to

T-Mobile: $120/month

Discover:$126/month

Capital one: $81/month 

Bank of America: $35/month 

Hospital bill: $105/month 

Various subscriptions: $30/month

I'm going to school soon and from experience I know campus jobs give minimal hours and minimum wage, so I'd probably make about $1000 a month. I want to use this to save and have a little spending money rather than paying the credit card bills and scraping to get by. I know I got myself into this mess but I don't see a way out other than filing for bankruptcy.

personalfinance,Made some misunderstandings and screw ups... help!,"So... I was trying to figure out some savings account stuff. Didn't get it done properly and screwed myself a tad but it's fixable. I just left a job. I got my PTO paid out, etc. Now I have a decent chunk in my checking. I was going to pay a bit down on my credit cards as the usage is way too high. But I found a huge issue. I have 1 more 40 hour check coming from the job, but I had put down to pay an extra $20 per pay period for federal taxes, but it took ONLY $20 for federal taxes. So now I'm screwed. I have chosen my last paycheck now to go all towards federal taxes. 

So now I have high credit usage, about 6k in checking. I will have a new job starting in December and probably owe close to the full 9k in taxes or whatever the amount is for married filing jointly. 

It's out of the question trying to repair with the previous payroll stuff because what's done is done. I'm the HR guy and I didn't catch it and it's my fault. I get that. 

I'm wondering if I should put my whole first 2 checks at the next job at like $700 each check towards federal and 401k. I believe to be in the 22%  bracket in 2022.

CryptoCurrency,A hopium tank hooked up to reality.,"You want hopium? Here's some that may not feel like it, but amidst all the current uncertainty it qualifies. Do we know when the true bottom will be? No. Has it already arrived? Nobody can answer that with certainty so we dunno. 

Here's what we do know. Before FTX ever happened the crypto market had already fallen by over 2 trillion dollars. That's more than two thirds of the entire market wiped. We know this is due to the fed tightening monetary policy to fix inflation. A simplified way of explaining this is that in 2021 we had a massive bullrun that saw Btc go from under 10k to nearly 70k and it obviously dragged all the alt coins to the moon with it.

This was only possible because the money printer went brrrr and large institutions and hedge funds with billions of dollars could borrow money at an interest rate of 0-2%... This means they could play monopoly with billions of dollars. 

Now inflation needs to be brought down and speculative assets like crypto won't be attractive until the  inflation is brought much closer to 2%. The best part however is that there **WILL** be another bullrun, despite everyone telling you nobody knows. Ultra rich people will always wanna gamble, and once the technical recession is dealt with somewhere later into 2023 the money printer will once again brrr us to the moon. 

The same people acting like we're in the great depression also won't tell you that billionaires move the market not average joes. Once conditions are favourable to take on debt again the bullrun will be back again and the next one will probably be the mother of them all because of regulations and such and crypto becoming a more entrenched idea.",cryptocurrency,1669106557

personalfinance,Paycheck are less after small raise,"Hello all! 

I’m wondering if anyone can help me make sense of this. I was working 40 hours per week and making $24.04, 2.7% state tax deductions and my biweekly checks were around $1400 per pay period after all other deductions (e.g. 401k, health insurance etcetera). 

I received a 3% raise so now I make $24.76 and now my checks are $1200~. Nothing has changed beyond the raise. Actually, I decreased my 401k contribution to 1%. HR can not really advise me, and want me to call the IRS which I will. I can see that my Federal deductions increased from like $180~ to $300. I claim just myself.

Can any one _kindly_ provide any kind insight into this?

Thank you in advance

personalfinance,Are finances supposed to be tight during the first year of house ownership? We should be fine “on paper” but I feel broke month-to-month.,"We locked in our interest rate right before they  started going up, and by my calculations all of the housing-related expenses would be less than 30% of our take-home pay. Naturally, we both felt really good. 

Our combined gross income is **$160k**, and we live in what is technically considered a HCOL area (CT), although it’s not as expensive here as the 2 big cities that are nearby. 

On paper we should have **$3k** or so left every month (***scroll all the way down down for budget breakdown***). 



Unfortunately, I completely underestimated all the house-related expenses. Since we got the house in April we’ve spent a little over **$10k** on stuff like furniture, appliances and tools. All of those purchases were discussed and considered necessary. 

I’m terrified of any repairs that might need to get done to the house eventually. Wife doesn’t think we need to worry, but I constantly feel broke and stressed. I hate the idea of taking on more debt, but we haven’t even finished building our emergency fund back up. 



Here’s the budget breakdown (most values are rounded up a bit):

	•	Monthly take-home pay (after taxes, 401k, health insurance):   $8,600
	•	Mortgage (principal, interest, taxes. homeowners insurance, PMI):   $1,910
	•	Car payments:   $550
	•	Car insurance:   $160
	•	Gas (on average):   $200
	•	Groceries (on average):   $1,000
	•	Electricity (on average):   $250
	•	Internet:   $70
	•	Phones:   $65
	•	Subscriptions (Spotify, gym, etc):   $100
	•	Healthcare (meds, therapy, etc):   $150
	•	Eating out (obvious weak point):   $400
	•	Entertainment/shopping/hobbies:   $400
	•	Pet supplies:   $60
	•	Miscellaneous:   $100

None of these amounts fluctuate too much month-to-month, besides eating out, which we are actively trying to bring under control. Our groceries budget went up with inflation - in 2019-2021 we rarely spent more than $600 a month. Nowadays I consider it a win if the weekly trip to the grocery store costs less than $250.

I know we’re technically not living paycheck-to-paycheck because we contribute to our retirement accounts, and don’t carry any CC debt month-to-month, but it definitely feels like it…




**EDIT:** For all of you asking why our groceries are so high, here’s a receipt from last week: [copied from receipt to excel for easy reading](https://i.imgur.com/GMFCEHw.jpg).

# [Stock futures tick higher on Tuesday morning](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday morning as worries over Covid cases in China kept investor sentiment in check.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 75 points, or 0.22%. S&amp;P 500 futures were 0.24% higher, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.16%. Shares of Best Buy popped 7.3% in premarket trading after the company hiked its 2023 fiscal outlook and beat earnings expectations.
*****
&gt; China saw its first deaths in the mainland from Covid since May over the weekend. It prompted fears among investors that the country could bring back restrictions meant to slow virus spread, which would hurt business.
*****
&gt; The news out of China pushed investors away from growth stocks Monday and toward defensive sectors like health care and utilities, said David Waddell, CEO of Waddell &amp; Associates. He said it also led to “reflexive” U.S. dollar buying, which gave bond yields upward pressure.
*****
&gt; “On low volume days like today, the market gets Pavlovian,” he said. “If you want to make sense of this market, watch the dollar.
*****
&gt; Stocks are coming off a down session, with the Dow losing 45 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite slid 0.4% and 1.1%, respectively. Losses on the Dow were kept in check by a 6.3% gain in Disney following the return of Bob Iger as CEO.
*****
&gt; On Tuesday, several Federal Reserve officials are set to speak, including Kansas City Fed President Esther George and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
*****
&gt; Economic reports due out include the Philadelphia Fed’s nonmanufacturing business outlook survey and the Richmond Fed’s manufacturing index.
*****
&gt; Investors are also watching for earnings reports from Dollar Tree, Best Buy, HP and Nordstrom. The stock market will be closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday and will close early on Friday.

They would reimburse me at the federal reimbursement rate of 0.625 per mile. 

With the price of gas, inflation causing repairs/oil changes, etc to be more expensive, would this reimbursement cover all that is needed? Or would I be losing money on this?

Also, since it is a traveling job, I was thinking of getting a better car to drive in the snow. I'd be driving all over upstate NY. I currently have a chevy cruze that gets 32 miles per gallon. A bigger car might be less fuel efficient, and I don't know if I want a better car if I'm just going to rack up the miles.

personalfinance,Should we sell or rent our house??,"Hi all, my husband &amp; I are in a bit of a unique situation. We will be moving in January for a job that will cover all of our housing expenses (rent &amp; utilities) plus pay a decent salary. We will not be able to live in our current house for at least two years, possibly longer depending on if we like the job enough to stay. We don’t know if we will. 

We can’t decide what to do with our house. We bought in January 2021 for $300k with 2.75% interest rate, so our monthly payment is $1520 (principal + interest + pmi + taxes + homeowners ins). We still owe about $265k on the mortgage. 

Option 1 - rent it out for roughly $2k a month. We would have to pay a property manager (looks like 10% is the norm around here, so $200 a month) because we will not be able to handle it ourselves. We have some concerns because our house is in a mountainous area so there are out of the norm things to maintain/deal with, such as pellet stoves, water softeners, freezing temps &amp; snow. The wrong tenant could cause a lot of damage (ie pipes freezing or catching the house on fire). Plus this house has never been rented before, it’s very very well maintained currently. We’d pocket about $250 a month but would pretty much just be saving that for any repairs/unrented times. 

Option 2 - sell our house for roughly $385-$400k. The housing market in our area has gone up significantly in the two years since we bought and we remodeled both the bathrooms VERY nicely so from looking at comps in the area we believe that’s a reasonable price. After selling costs etcs I expect we’d pocket anywhere from $50-75k.

Basically we’re not sure if the $250 a month is worth the headache of trying to be long-distance landlords, but it’s really hard for me to justify giving up one of the historically lowest mortgage rates.

What surprised me is that the two-year dividend total trends continually downward. 

Is this downward trend  because of the  macroeconomic conditions (including Fed Fund rates) that occurred over that period of time?  I don't think I should expect this to occur in the general case.

personalfinance,What do we do with our house when we move?,"So, here's the deal: we own our current house (owe 326k, 2.25%, payment is about 1610 after HOA fees).

I suspect it would rent for $2300/mo fairly easily (high turnover of families in this area, lots of renters). 

Other financial info: 
It's a VA loan, so we can't use a 0 down if we move and keep this house.

We have about 3 mo in savings for recurring expenses.

I was working part time (just enough to cover daycare/private school at $1600/mo), but have been trouble picking up shifts lately. 

We have no other debt. 

Husband makes 65k/year, definitely not going to lose his job.

We are set to move this summer (probably going to be May or June) for husband's work. We will be in the new place (LCOL area) about 3 years or so, probably. The houses I like are around the 325-350k range again. 

Here's the problem: I'm pregnant with our 3rd, due around the time we move. I'm set to start a new job for a few months here at 80k/yr (got the job around the time we learned we were moving). I will have a guaranteed job at the new place when we move at the same pay rate IF I don't take maternity leave (which might be possible- my first 2 pregnancies were pretty good in terms of my health, so I'm thinking vacation time + sick time), but if things don't go well with this pregnancy, then I may or may not be able to work immediately after moving and will not have automatic job protection. 

Do we sell this house? It's probably worth 400-425k if we can be patient and wait for it to sell. How can we afford to buy a new house without selling this one? 3.5% down on a FHA? The current mortgage is taking up the VA loan, so we would need a down payment to buy a new one.  I'm just worried about higher interest rates in buying a new house, PLUS PMI. I hate the idea of paying PMI, but with this house potentially renting so well, it's tough to pass on the residential income. We previously rented out our old house, and it turned out very well for us. 

The move + the 3rd baby + not having job protection because I won't  be there for a year when I'm due is really making me nervous. 

So, do we sell or keep this house? If we sell, can we let someone assume our VA loan and charge a higher price for the great loan terms?  What will protect us the best?",finance,1669136402

Is this downward trend because of the macroeconomic conditions (including Fed Fund rates) that occurred over that period of time? I don't think I should expect this to occur in the general case.

If I had invested at the beginning of the fund, my cash flow would steadily decrease as time went on.

## Why is happening:

A lesson for the folks here. You can spoof token transfers on Explorers.

These are the hacker's real addresses, but these transfers are spoofed using a custom [spoofed token](https://medium.com/etherscan-blog/spoof-tokens-on-ethereum-c2ad882d9cf6) contract I created on the Sepolia testnet. They allow you to send from any address to any other address without needing those to be the 'msg.sender'. So the Explorer displays the transfers as coming from someone else's address.

The exploit uses a contract where the 'requires' statements that check for **approval/allowance** are removed.

The fun part is that the hacker is stuck with these tokens (unless he figures out the ABI for the contract I used).

## What you need to watch out for:

On a serious note, there is a second lesson that you need to be careful with token approvals. These contracts work because the token approval has been removed.

All of you are STILL using [**UNLIMITED approvals**](https://nova-explorer.arbitrum.io/address/0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0) on your real MOON tokens on the Arbitrum Nova. This is not safe unless you absolutely trust the contract. And it's not hard to create bad contracts as I've just shown you. I could create a contract with good functions and a backdoor function. If you gave my swap contract unlimited approval, I could one day choose to trigger that backdoor function without your knowing.

You can use this [Token Approvals tool](https://nova.arbiscan.io/tokenapprovalchecker) to check for your approvals on Arbitrum Nova.

I find it a bit ironic that most of you think you're being safe by taking your tokens off exchanges, using self-custody, and saying things like ""NYKNYC"". But then you do unsafe things like unlimited approvals. Who knows if there's a major bug in the contract.",cryptocurrency,1669140648
personalfinance,Consolidating Debt and Mortgages,"I'm looking into ways of improving my credit score. It's currently not super great due to high balances on a couple of credit cards due to covid and school-related expenses. The idea of consolidating them all into one single loan will help me approach things mentally and make it much easier for me to budget. It's mostly coming from a desire to streamline fiances.  


Will consolidating my CC debt into a personal loan change anything relating to my credit score? The amount of debt would be the same but my credit usage would go way down.   


I've been shopping around for options and I'd get a better interest rate than the average of all the cards combined (the loan averages are all lower than my lowest CC interest rate). Plus my monthly payment would be about the same, if not a little lower. (I'd still keep paying the same amount to pay it down faster).

cybersecurity,The Various Flavors of Zero Trust - Lessons learned over the past year,"Hey all, earlier this year a former colleague and I spun up a new podcast to chat with practitioners (no tech vendors) about how and why they adopt the concept of Zero Trust. We just wrapped our first season, but here are a few of my take aways and some episodes down below. We also just [released our latest with Chase Cunningham](https://open.spotify.com/episode/6eELrFVDwLTvpgjnXbnuZF), the Forrester analyst who followed after Kindervag.

**WTF is Zero Trust?**

Is there a unified definition? Hard no.

US Federal Government? Use the term frequently. It's widely accepted after the White House dropped their memo in January. They align it with systems both [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture) and [CISA](https://www.cisa.gov/zero-trust-maturity-model) have released.

Private sector? This is where things get fuzzy, fast. It's also the inspiration for why we created AZT. Typically companies rely on three primary outlets for introductions to new areas of infosec, and as Zero Trust is more philosophical than a technology vertical like SOAR or XDR, so it's a bit more challenging to pin down. 

Those three being: analyst groups (Forrester/Gartner) especially market guides, security technology vendors (their website, lobbying to analyst groups, blogs, etc.), and the occasional working group (Oasis Open, Cloud Security Alliance). There are of course sites like ZDNET and others that also cover it, but in many pieces you'll see tech vendors throwing their weight around. The first two are also typically intertwined since vendors lobby analyst groups to adjust the market guide to better align with their definitions.

However, since Forrester and John K really built this up over a decade, and there was a noticeable gap in how it was positioned around technology (really was more of a concept/strategy), that's why there are so many different flavors of it today. We chatted with [Chase about that topic](https://www.adoptingzerotrust.com/p/adopting-zero-trust-with-chase-cunningham#details), as that was one of the areas he updated the Forrester materials around ZT.

This is a long way of saying that the private sector feels Zero Trust is either a repackaging of existing concepts and strategies, the unattainable (goal post will always have to move) approach to infosec, or even a philosophy.

However, for companies, they most often confuse Zero Trust with technology. Of our guests, especially the MSPs/MSSPs, they are frequently asked how they can implement Zero Trust and think it is solved via technology like MFA, an IdP/IAM solution, or other network access tools. Fortunately they are well versed on having companies take a step back and to look at what security goals they have as technology is not some silver bullet. You all know this, so preaching to the choir here. 

After a dozen interviews so far, I can firmly say that once you cut through the noise of ZT, it's not just bullshit, but you do have to dig through quite a bit of it to get there.

Here's a few episodes that highlight the various flavors of Zero Trust

Bitcoin,Quantum state of the Union 2022,"Its interesting to keep an eye on Quantum computing so I thought to make a break down of what interesting from the [IBM quantum state of the union 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZu5hutqANk&amp;ab_channel=IBMResearch)

Quick rundown of why is this interesting regarding bitcoin:

1. One of the hearts of bitcoin is the sha-256 hashing algorithm. This cannot be cracked by classical computers even if Moors law stays in effect. However for a quantum computer which have - and is able to utilize - a single CPU with \~1.9 billion logical qubits (so about 8-12+ times that in physical), this becomes trivial. 
2. Once this, if ever, happens its not just that bitcoin is fucked, but everything else you can image in the digital world is also fucked (in fact, waaaay more fucked since the attack vector is probably a lot broader). For this reason there are already exists a [suit of cryptographic](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos/2.5.0?topic=cryptography-crystals-kyber-algorithm) solutions to switch to. There are two problems though. One is that the resulting hash is 4+ times larger then sha-256. The other is that they obviously cannot be stress tested until we have such a machine. 

**So where we are at?**

IBM just introduced they new Osprey Quantum CPU with a whooping 433 physical qubits! Depending on how much error correction you are shooting for that's about 36-52 logical qubits. The thing is the size of a frying pan, you need to cool it with a proprietary, hand built system the size of a freezer room. 

To use it, you have to break down your very specific problem into parts, where some of it can be fed to the Quantum computer, the rest have to be done by classical computers. For our sha-256 example it would need classical computers for orchestration and a shitton of ASIC-s for hash generation as well. 

**Why is this tech so slow?**

First off, watch the video. Even if the techno bla-bla goes over your head, the general feeling of complexity wont. 

1. [Because it doesn't work on room temperature](https://youtu.be/nZu5hutqANk?t=2085). To make the quantum processes even possible, you have to cool shit to near absolute zero. Then you need to get rid of all the heat that process generates. Its the same problem as a btc-miner just cranked up to eleven, if you cool on one end it has to heat up on the other end. The infrastructure to do this is brutal. Both in size and energy consumption. Right now they work on huge car-sized fridges to cool the entire computer section instead of individual cpu-s.
2. [Then we have error correction](https://youtu.be/nZu5hutqANk?t=737). Quantum computers are different from classical ones. Really stupid example: Instead of one and zero, you have a ""curve"" of probability of state for each qubit. You use more then one qubits (8-12) for the same state to have a solid idea what it represents, the more you use the better idea you have, but some room for ""error"" always remains. Now qubits, just like transistors, work in combinations to represent something of value. For example the decimal number 13 is four transistors flipped to 1 1 0 1 in combination. You can also ""flip"" 4 qubits to do something but those little remaining error possibilities accumulate. Exponentially. They try to mitigate this with using classical computers but the problem remains: You have a linear growth trajectory of number of possible qubits in the system, combined with an exponentially growing error correction need.

**So the thing where they break sha-256 in 10 years?**

Yeah... unless some earth shattering innovation happens, its a Nope. If you watch it, its clear they are already planning to make this into a multi-processor, modular system, for solving smaller, low qubit requirement problems in tandem with classical computers. Exactly because just increasing the qubits on one CPU is physically prohibitive. I find it hard to image that this tech is going to ""sneak up"" on anyone regarding cryptography. If they are able to double the single CPU qubits every year (which it seems are not even planned after Condor) they would get to the theoretically required 19 billion physical qubits by around \~2047.

I am trying to figure out if I am wrong or overthinking this. Earlier this year I sold the previous home that I rented out for a few years because the appreciation of the house just went insane over the last 3 years. It nearly tripled in price and renters were wanting out, because they didn't agree with me increasing the rent by $75/month. It just made a lot of sense to let it go, the value of it just didn't match the rent rates in the area when I did the math on paper. I was only cash flowing around $850 after expenses, so I sold it...plus I was wanting to take a job in another state and move. 

Since selling it I have had the proceeds in my Ally Savings until just recently when I moved it over to SCHD  @ 67.44 to catch the dividends \~3.25%, which should net me around $3200/Q ($1040/month) in dividend payouts.

solarenergy,"Entergy Texas and Net-Metering, do they credit only surplus energy produced or all energy produced?","We have Entergy Texas as our electricity provider and recently installed solar panels. When our net-metering was approved, I received the following email statement from Entergy:

&amp;#x200B;

""The **excess** kilowatt-hours produced by the customer and sent to the distribution grid will be credited each month on the customer's electric bill. The credit cannot be transferred to another account. In a grid fed system, **electricity produced by the solar system will supply a home and its appliances first, and only feed electricity into the grid if there is any surplus electricity**.""

&amp;#x200B;

However on Entergy Texas website, it says "" the customer will be **billed for all energy (kWh) supplied** by the Utility and will be credited for any energy (kWh) supplied to the grid. The customer will **receive a credit for all energy (kWh) supplied** to the grid.""

&amp;#x200B;

These two statements are very different. The first one suggests that all energy produced will offset the energy used, and we will be credited if there is a surplus (which would then mean we would be billed for the difference not produced). However the 2nd statement is saying that we are billed for ALL energy used and credited for ALL energy produced. The rate for energy used is significantly higher than the rate for energy produced, so if we're going by statement 2, then that means unless we produce almost 300% more than we use, we won't ever break even. 

&amp;#x200B;

So for example, let's say that in 1 month we produce 1000 kWh and use 800 kWh. The billed rate is $0.10/kWh and the credited rate is $0.04/kWh. Under statement 1, our monthly bill would come out to an $8 credit, whereas under statement 2 we would have a bill of $40.

I owe about 3K more at around 6% interest.  I have a credit score of near 800.  My car payment is about $100 a month.  Full coverage insurance comes out to about 40 a month.  While it would be cool to get full coverage removed, I doubt I ever will.  

\----Would it be pretty easy to get one of the banks I usually use to give me a good deal on an auto loan --------if I am just trying to transfer banks?  

\---Would it be more beneficial to me to get a personal loan and pay the car loan off with that?  

I toyed with the idea of putting it on a credit card.  At the time of purchase, my credit card had an interest rate of 5.7% with a 30K limit.  I used it like an on demand personal loan.  I am glad that I chose against doing that!!  Due to monetary tightening policies on a higher level than us, that rate has gone up to almost 9%! 

I could always leave it, I just don't like to.  I pay things off faster when I look at the balance every day.

Bitcoin,EL Salvador takes first step to issue Bitcoin Volcano bonds.,"A digital securities bill has been presented to El Salvador’s Congress, paving the way for the issuance of bitcoin-backed bonds. El Salvador’s Minister of the Economy Maria Luisa Hayem Brevé submitted a digital assets issuance bill to the country’s legislative assembly, paving the way for the launch of its bitcoin-backed “volcano” bonds.

First announced one year ago today, the pioneering initiative seeks to attract capital and investors to El Salvador. It was revealed at the time the plans to issue $1 billion in bonds on the Liquid Network, a federated Bitcoin sidechain, with the proceedings of the bonds being split between a $500 million direct allocation to bitcoin and an investment of the same amount in building out energy and bitcoin mining infrastructure in the region.

A sidechain is an independent blockchain that runs parallel to another blockchain, allowing for tokens from that blockchain to be used securely in the sidechain while abiding by a different set of rules, performance requirements, and security mechanisms. Liquid is a sidechain of Bitcoin that allows bitcoin to flow between the Liquid and Bitcoin networks with a two-way peg. A representation of bitcoin used in the Liquid network is referred to as L-BTC. Its verifiably equivalent amount of BTC is managed and secured by the network's members, called functionaries.
“Digital securities law will enable El Salvador to be the financial center of central and south America,” wrote Paolo Ardoino, CTO of cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex, on Twitter.

Bitfinex is set to be granted a license in order to be able to process and list the bond issuance in El Salvador.

The bonds will pay a 6.5% yield and enable fast-tracked citizenship for investors. The government will share half the additional gains with investors as a Bitcoin Dividend once the original $500 million has been monetized. These dividends will be dispersed annually using Blockstream's asset management platform.

The act of submitting the bill, which was hinted at earlier this year, kickstarts the first major milestone before the bonds can see the light of day. The next is getting it approved, which is expected to happen before Christmas, a source close to President Nayib Bukele told Bitcoin Magazine. The bill was submitted on November 17 and presented to the country’s Congress today.

personalfinance,Here is a simple Budget Spreadsheet that includes your 2023 federal taxes (std. deduction applied).,"Hey gang, I made a simple 2023 budget [Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ntqps4I6KKDsXM5VaeCUKkCyrUq8FouhJWe0zAfkXqA/edit) (this is now old, see new version below). It will auto calculate your federal taxes (including standard deduction). **You only need to edit the bordered cells, everything greyed out is a formula and shouldn’t be touched unless you want to customize certain cells yourself.** Cheers, and Happy Holidays!

EDIT: New version [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DAu7EpbvaC4KA7bC0UN1AB9ORweL9HHW9sPL-T10R_Y/edit). I added FICA and state insurance taxes, more pre-tax deductions, a long term savings section under expenses, and more. State taxes are not calculated here but there is a link on the information page to figure yours out (and a spot to put them when you do). I’ll still keep working to see how I can improve it, all input/help is appreciated.

HOW DO I EDIT THIS?: When you open it (at least on mobile), the share/save button lets you send a text (I sent it to myself), and the link it sends you let’s you open an editable version in google drive. 

You can make a copy on PC by opening it through google drive, then clicking file&gt;make a copy, then edit that. It is a nightmare to figure out lol, wish I could share it easier.",finance,1669183448
personalfinance,Learning About Compound Interest,"Every time I've seen a chart or other educational materials meant to demonstrate the power of saving ""just a little bit"" of money every year - usually to the tune of a kilodollar per year there's always this absurd year-after-year steady interest rate of 10% with continuous compounding interest.   


Where on earth do we find these sorts of investments? Is there any point to demonstrating something like this with (what I feel are) highly unrealistic numbers? Most savings accounts I've seen have sub 1% interest let alone ten times that. Is investing really that potent?  


As far as I know farmland is about the only thing that stays steady like this and it's closer to 8% most years, but (from what I could find) one needed to be nigh into the megadollars of networth to have enough money for such ventures.",finance,1669184977

CryptoMarkets,Captial flight on increase rates,"So the explanation for capital flowing out of the crypto market is being attributed to the rising interest rates.  Largely due to the fact the cost of borrowing money is greater.  

Also, it's commonly accepted the 2021 bull market was down to cheap money with low rates.  The cost of borrowing was almost free so the capital flowed into crypto.

So my question.. Why is the cost of borrowing so much more influential then return on investment as well as the principle itself?

Example: If i was investing $100 million into a project, why is borrowing cost more influential then 1) the actual preservation of the 100m and 2) expected return- if it goes up 25% who cares whether the borrowing cost is 1% or 5%??

Also, if the project isn't solid who cares about APY of you loose 50 million on a dump?

REKT by SBF

Update 4-11-2022

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

UPDATE 29-10-2022

As Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

CryptoCurrency,The recent pumps are still institutions trying to fight the FED.,"There still seems to be loads of institutions that are attempting to short the market, and a mixture of retail not taking Jerome Powell seriously. And of course it didn't take long for news articles to pop up claiming traders are gauging the state of the market or that bullishness is returning to crypto.

It is my opinion that this is one big ass bear trap and no matter what they refer to it as (santa rally, lmao?) it won't end well for retailer gamblers looking to play with the big boys shorting Btc. Powell will announce later today what the next rate hike will be. Many are already talking about a ' dovish ' tone. 

People often say don't try to catch a falling knife but at this stage it seems like red hot burning knives and the institutions and media love playing with peoples emotions, because if you were certain you wouldn't be easy to manipulate.

 Macro trend still looks rocky, rate hikes will most likely drag crypto to newer lows. Even if the rate hikes go to 0.50 or 0.25 they are still being raised before a pause. And that pause won't come in the first quarter of 2023, fed has already decided this and their recent 0.75 increase x4 is the quickest in modern history, so prepare yourselves folks, Powell is not screwing around.",cryptocurrency,1669197851
bonds,Long duration US bonds a no brainer?,"*I had a hunch that it is a good time to start buying long dated 20y+ US Treasuries, so compiled a short set of notes. Would love to hear what you guys think.*

There are strong arguments to be made that the US is headed into a recession and that inflation is subsiding.

At the same time, the Fed is performing QT. UK was also performing QT until the recent blowup in the UK gilt market:

https://preview.redd.it/jmixci7jeo1a1.png?width=819&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=de61c8a21a047bb9b6275c25fd6ae666bd106bd8

There are concerns of drying liquidity and the US Treasury is considering buybacks. However it is not clear [when](https://twitter.com/FedGuy12/status/1587785170530099200?s=20&amp;t=Ti5oRjjPmLtC4-rlVYGWXA).

RRP can help with liquidity issues, but those are primarily MMFs parking their money. MMFs buy near-term instruments. So the money from RRP are not going to flow into long dated bonds.

[93%](https://ticdata.treasury.gov/Publish/mfh.txt) of the Treasury securities held by the foreign holders are in T-Bonds &amp; Notes. Japan for instance started selling its Treasuries in order to defend the sliding yen:

https://preview.redd.it/upk0n5woeo1a1.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=037350a36106f2ad27bc42d5f4e9ad959f6c63f7

It seems like the long duration Treasuries are the least liquid?

&gt;Morgan Stanley in a research note said that off-the-run liquidity is most impaired in U.S. 10-year notes, followed by 20-year and 30-year bonds, as well as five-year notes.

Buying long dated bonds seems like a no brainer? If we have a recession and inflation decreases, the Fed will ease. However if inflation persists, the Fed will continue to tighten, worsening the liquidity and thus forcing the Treasury to eventually start buying the least liquid off-the-run Treasuries which are mostly long duration bonds. **Bonds can only go up**?",finance,1669198626

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were marginally higher on Wednesday morning, as investors looked ahead to Federal Reserve meeting minutes for clues into the pace of future interest rate hikes.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 20 points points, or 0.1. S&amp;P 500 futures also gained 0.1% along with Nasdaq 100 futures.
*****
&gt; Shares of Nordstrom fell more than 8% in the premarket after the department store chain reaffirmed its forecast. However, Nordstrom beat profit and sales expectations in its latest results, according to consensus expectations on Refinitiv.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off an upbeat session, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average surging nearly 400 points Tuesday. The S&amp;P 500 rose 1.36%, closing above the 4,000 level for the first time since September. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite jumped 1.36%.
*****
&gt; Investors shrugged off fears of further lockdowns in China after the country reported its first Covid deaths since May. Instead, traders focused on some strong earnings reports, and bet on the likelihood for an easing in monetary policy from the Fed going forward.
*****
&gt; “Investor psychology remaining optimistic is driving the rally in this market,” Eugene Profit, CEO at Profit Investments, said Tuesday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “Going into the next Fed meeting, I think the Fed will probably moderate their language a little bit, and I think investors want to remain optimistic, and ignore a lot of headwinds in this market,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors will review the latest Fed meeting minutes on Wednesday for insight into the central bank’s approach on monetary policy ahead of the December meeting.
*****
&gt; Earlier in November, the central bank approved a fourth consecutive 0.75 percentage point hike that brought rates to their highest level since 2008. Economists are forecasting a half percentage point increase in December, and smaller rate hikes next year.
*****
&gt; Additionally, investors will parse through the latest jobless claims data. Economists polled by Dow Jones are forecasting claims of 225,000 for the week ending Nov. 19, a slight increase from the 222,000 initial claims the prior week.
*****
&gt; They’re also expecting the latest data on durable goods and new home sales in October. Durable goods in October are expected to have risen 0.5% from the prior month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.

financialindependence,My 25 Year FI Journey,"November marks my 25th anniversary working towards financial independence. I hope others might benefit from the observations I gathered over an extended timeframe of perseverance.

I began adulthood with severe anxiety regarding finances.

I developed FIRE-type thinking before FIRE was a commonly understood philosophy. My thinking developed through personal experiences and later through forums such as these. FIRE thinking helped me to overcome an unhealthy fear of becoming destitute while accelerating other life goals that have brought peace, contentment, and happiness to everyday life.

This article documents that journey as a means to give back to a community which has given much to me. I hope it is informative, supportive, and motivating for everyone on their own journey. I will answer questions and offer additional perspective in the comments where possible.

This is a throw away account and certain milestones have been obfuscated to create some semblance of privacy and anonymity, though all financial figures quoted are accurate.

**Outline**

1. About Me
2. My FI Philosophy
3. Milestones
4. My Investment Philosophy
5. My Expense Pattern
6. My Evolving View Of FI
7. Lessons &amp; Observations

**About Me**

I achieved FI in 2017. I have no plans to RE.

I am mid-40s living in a HCOL area. Married with no kids as we prefer partying over parenting.

I grew up in upper lower class economic conditions around military bases. My parents struggled to save money outside of any retirement benefits afforded from their jobs. Frequently being unable to have the trips, food, clothes, and toys that the “other” kids had formed an indelible mark. There have been periods where I have had significant anxiety regarding financial safety.

I work in tech. My wife is an overworked, underpaid social worker.

My career began as a deeply indebted student and after graduation included jobs in training, engineering, product, executive leadership, startup CEO, investing, and governance.

I write a well-read technology blog and authored 3 books that are now irrelevant.

I travel extensively, sometimes for work, sometimes pleasure. I have visited 50 countries. I have a pilot’s license. I own 2 houses, a plane, 2 cars, and a boat.

**My FI Philosophy**

1. **Live Life Below My Means.** I should always be saving money, regardless of what my income level is. As long as I earn a W2 income from a job, my monthly expenses should be (on average) at least 50% below the average after-tax income. This also means that it’s OK to increase my spend on quality of life as my means has increased, though it wasn’t until my 30s before I practiced this without stress. As you'll see, having this policy is easier to state than to always follow.
2. **FI Definition.** Because of my youthful anxiety towards money, difficulty in determining what a viable number of years “in retirement” might be, and debates as to what constitutes a Safe Withdrawal Rate (SWR), I chose to shape a personal definition. For me, FI is the ability to generate enough income from non-W2 activities such that my annual rate of expenses is covered. Income generation can happen from rents, selling volatility, interest, or dividends. In other words, FI is when my net worth continues to grow with or without traditional W2 income. This philosophy may change one day – either because the net worth pool is large or the expected number of years before death materially shrinks.
3. **Eliminate Debt, Even If It Is An Economic Mistake.** After having bought and sold five different homes, I came to realize that the mental stress of having debt outweighed its economic benefits. Starting sometime around 2018, I decided to eliminate all possible debt, even 2% mortgage debt.  While the arbitrage of investment results would have yielded a better overall economic outcome by keeping the debt, that financial gain could never be large enough to compensate for the anxiety-neutralizing-feeling of being “debt free”. Whatever I owned was owned by me alone, and in the unlikely event I were to become unemployed or without income, the future of those assets was solely in my control and not in conjunction with a bank. I execute this policy on life assets, such as my primary home and automobile, and toy assets, such as my      plane. This, of course, requires a person to have enough assets to cover the debt, and it took me 15 years to achieve this threshold.
4. **Invest To Beat The Market.** If I am willing to devote more energy and research time than others (at the cost of fun, family time, etc), then I should be able to make smarter decisions that yield higher results. Split investments into those things which are liquid vs. illiquid. Try to keep most of my available cash in liquid investments. I prefer (and try) to earn equity in illiquid investments through time-based contributions, sweat equity, carried interest, or as a job      benefit. This doesn’t always happen, and I have had to outlay cash for angel investments, as a limited partner in a VC fund, and stock purchases for companies I’ve run. Never let others manage our money as they lack incentives to behave as an owner. As you’ll see, lacking this wisdom once cost me $3M in my early career.

Definitions:

* Net Worth: The value of all assets where I maintain liquidation control less all known or anticipated liabilities. The assets include fixed assets like my home, plane, and automobiles. While they are illiquid, the choice to effect a sale is within my control.  The assets also include the net liquidating value of trading accounts, deferred compensation, 401K, IRAs, and checking accounts.  The liabilities include any outstanding debts including mortgages and credit along with any future anticipated taxes that would be due from liquidating 401K, IRA or deferred compensation accounts.
* Additional Illiquid Assets: This is the mark-to-market (ie, my personal best guess) for the carrying value of additional assets for which I am entitled, but for which I have little control as to when or how they may become liquid. These include angel investments, the value of my shares of VC funds for which I am a limited partner, and carried interest for investments that were sourced as a VC scout. This value does not exclude anticipated taxes which is hard to calculate since some taxes are paid in advance of receiving distributions. It’s possible that the tax burden on the remaining distributions could be &lt;20%.  It’s possible that all these assets become worthless, but unlikely, as the $9.4M carrying value is spread across more than 3 dozen businesses and about half of those have already been sold or already profitable.
* W2 Income: The income received by my wife and I from our W2 jobs.

Footnotes:

1. I had an amazing thing happen about 18 months after university. I was working as a grunt in a consulting firm that had some acquisition interest from a large publicly traded company who was making aggressive moves into an area of technology where I had been tasked. The acquisition was moving fast and the firm needed to produce certain deliverables in a week that would normally require months. I stepped up and found a way to deliver the assets. The consultancy got acquired for what was a great outcome for the founder. Without expectation, he surprised me one day and offered to pay off my remaining $80K in student loans.  I was hired by the acquiring company as a domain specialist and they doubled my income to $70K.  The feeling can only be described as elation followed by a long cry.  It was a powerful lesson in what the value of hard, dedicated work can bring.
2. The dotcom boom and bust was another high and low time. The company that acquired me gave a nice pool of options. In the matter of a year, those options were worth nearly $4M at one point. It was intoxicating to watch the value increase nearly every day as the Nasdaq skyrocketed.  I had cashed out some of the options when they were available, but most I did not. To make matters worse, I decided to exercise and hold a good chunk of the options which means that taxes were due on the paper profits. I ended up selling a bunch of options to pay those taxes to the tune of nearly $400K. At the time I was unaware of steps that I could take to protect the value of the options that were unvested or that insurance was available which could lock in their value.  If I had known that I could spend 10-15% of the value of the options to lock in their value, I would have done it.  But I was young and naïve and believing that stocks only go up.  The company I was in had a public high of $98 and by the time the dotcom crash had settled they were down to $4.  I was able to sell some of the options and netted a profit of around $300K and the government got to hold onto that $400K in early tax payments.  It wouldn’t be until the financial crash in 2009 where I could finally reclaim most of these early tax payments to use as a deduction against income (see the next footnote).
3. The financial crisis of 2008-2010 was a difficult time. I was sitting on three homes, had overpaid for the last home, and had mortgages on all three. When the housing crisis kicked in, I was nearly $750K under water across the three properties. You’ll note that my net worth somehow increased. I saved my bacon through research and a little help from the government. Turns out that if you can get a valid short sale offer in California then the bank will eat the losses on the underwater part of the mortgage. And further, Congress passed a law in 2008 or 2009 that allowed taxpayers to write off the loss for up to two years (the $750K mortgage write off is normally taxed as income). It effectively allowed me to sell two of the homes, walk away from the mortgages, and not owe any taxes.  This turned into one boost to my net worth as I was starting to carry the losses against the net worth. The consequence was a massive hit to my credit which lasted 7 years. I had no plans to open new credit cards in that time frame, so felt like a good compromise.  The other boost to the net worth was the final reconciliation of what happened in Footnote 2, where Congress allowed taxpayers to take any pre-paid taxes from previous years and to deduct 50% of what’s remaining each of the next two years. This dramatically reduced the income on which I owed taxes, gave me a huge refund for two years, and then boosted the net worth.
4. While the stock market had one of its best years in a decade in 2021, it was one of my worst trading years at -21%. For reasons that will be described in future sections, most of my trading for IRAs and trading accounts (\~85% of my liquid assets), are traded by selling volatility which is somewhat anti-correlated to buy-and-hold. Strong, unrelenting bull markets that have no price relief are difficult for this style of trading to do well and, thus, the performance hit. In spite of this negative performance, the year was a positive net worth year because of distributions from VC funds, the surprise sale of two angel investments, and a small secondary event (the opportunity to sell a portion of my equity) from the company for which I currently run.

My investment philosophy has shifted over 25 years. My current approach, which was enacted in its fullest amount in 2012, involves:

1. **401K.** Maximize my participation and get any employer match. These funds go into a fairly conservative 2030 fund which is mostly bonds a little bit of stocks.  This currently accounts for 8% of my liquid investable net worth.
2. **IRA.** Whenever I leave one job, I immediately rollover any 401K funds into a non-ROTH IRA. This accounts for 22% of my investable funds. The IRA trades by selling volatility through iron condors against broad-based indexes like NDX or SPX.
3. **Cash.** I rotate my checking and emergency cash by investing into tbills, treasuries, and ibonds through Treasury Direct.  This has yielded 0.2% to 5% depending upon how interest rates are fluctuating. I mostly do 8 week short term rollovers.  It slows in the winter to make any cash needed for taxes available. This equates to 9% of my liquid investable assets.
4. **Brokerage.** This is all of my other investable liquid assets. The brokerage trades by selling volatility through naked leveraged strangles in a portfolio margin account. This was a strategy that I developed a long time ago after spending dozens of weekends reading and learning about options. Selling volatility isn’t for the faint of heart, but if managed well you can reliably return 16% / year while assuming above average, but not “destroy you” risk.  Over the years, I have tried to ‘tweak’ how I sell volatility to boost the returns and this generally has backfired. In 2020 during the down turn I decided to alter the approach in a way which would penalize me if the market were to climb aggressively.  And, well, that is what it did for 18 months and I took it on the chin.  Selling volatility is very good in soft down and flat markets, such as what we are experiencing in 2022.  And, thus, it’s been a spectacular year of returns.  While there are no guarantees of the future, I expect to moderate how volatility is sold so that I can more reliably return 15% / year with fewer massive up / down years: ie, lower returns with lower results volatility.

If you have done the math, I have 83% of my investable liquid assets in volatility, which is leveraged, and higher risk.  It’s also generally anti-correlated to the stock market. In years that the market does well, volatility will not do as well.  Why?  A few reasons: a) My job and illiquid assets are heavily correlated to how the NASDAQ will perform with many factors beyond my control, b) volatility is a form of anti-correlation to most of my assets creating a blended return which (over time) adds to a combined net worth, c) I am a horrible public markets stock picker; almost every buy-and-hold bet I make doesn’t yield good results; selling volatility is an approach that allows me to not have to make a judgement on fair value or price of the index; therefore it is programmatic in what is needed rather than having to endlessly study 1000s of public market companies to make investment bets.

If 30-year treasuries ever breach 10% again like in the 70s, I will put everything I have into them and call it a day. No need to deal with selling volatility if that scenario plays out. Yes, inflation would be monstrous in that scenario, but it would be nice to know that a 10% rate of return is guaranteed for 30 years. And chances are the value of those debt instruments will increase over that time frame yielding a total return higher than 10%.

As mentioned previously, even if my expectation for selling volatility is 18% / year on average, then it would economically make sense to have a mortgage or HELOC on my properties, especially when their interest rate was &lt;2%. The arbitrage on a $1M mortgage is over 15% / year and that is before you factor the mortgage interest tax deduction. In my 20s and 30s, this would have been a must-do imperative. Unfortunately, it took me 20 years to realize that the financial gain from the arbitrage doesn’t cover the mental stress of having debt with a creditor who takes a senior lien position.

**My Expense Pattern**

I’ve tried to structure my “run rate” expenses to comfortable sit below my after tax W2 income.  Investment gains and other assets generally should not be sourced for funding the normal lifestyle of which I live.  My wife and I are generally minimalists, though for the few things we own or experience, we are comfortable in purchasing a premium product or experience.  This especially includes vacations, for which we will attempt to do one 4 week trip every few years, and a number of 5 day and 8 day trips each year.

I consider my “run rate” expenses to include mortgages, insurance, food, fuel, utilities, vacations, furniture, electronics, medical bills, clothes, jewelry. Generally, anything that we need to spend money on that isn’t considered an investment or necessary for us to live.

To better reflect the spending patterns, I am excluding any lump sum payments such as a down payment made for a mortgage. The reverse is also true, excluding any lump sum payment received when selling a home.

My historical tax rate has been \~32% across federal and state taxes after netting out any credits and deductions.  I’ve been generally tax inefficient during my income years as I’ve always seen that the steps necessary to lower the tax rate meaningfully were too much of an inconvenience to warrant the potential gains.  I expect our effective tax rate to inch towards 38% in the coming years.

**My Work History**

I only consistently made $250K of W2 income starting in 2016.  At this time, my net worth was $2.6M with another $5.2M in illiquid assets. Our average income over those previous 16 years was $235K with 8 years making less than $200K. While $200K is a very generous income and above the average of most people, my key point is that the combined net worth of $7.8M is far above the $3.8M in taxable income earned over that same period.

A persistent, hard working family that chooses to spend below their earnings that intelligently invests their savings is able to build significant worth beyond the limits of what their job provides.

Like the stock market, my career has its ups and downs.

Interestingly, it’s marked by a number of short stints interspersed among long stints. I’ve worked in large publicly traded companies and as employee #1 in a startup. In my 25-year working career, the longest period of not having a W2 paying job has been 3 months.

I have only maintained a single W2 paying job at one time.  I am, however, allowed to simultaneously angel invest, be a VC scout, sit on boards, and consult for companies across the tech ecosystem while I perform my primary function as employee.  All of these additional activities help to build my portfolio of additional illiquid assets. I am earning sweat equity rather than having to outlay significant cash to build these positions.

**My Evolving View Of Financial Independence**

While young, my view of financial worth was measured by net worth.  “Will I ever be worth 1 MILLION dollars?!?”, as if that number held a magical quality that, if achieved, suddenly made one financially well-off. The day I became a millionaire was anti-climatic other than the entertainment value of seeing two commas on my tracking sheet.  And that financial milestone was quickly discarded in favor of achieving the next million because I didn’t feel safe / stable / protected with just having one.  And then the next one, and next one after that.

Net worth is not a good way to quantify your financial independence.

I’m familiar with the 4% SWR, and it’s always struck me as a challenging measure of whether someone has the financial means to retire early. There are too many challenges: how long do you live, changing macro conditions, unknowns about social safety nets, and so on.  But even worse, the 4% SWR is a model where, generally, your net worth is likely to decline over those years depending upon how the investment portfolio performs.

As a way to deal with this anxiety, I’ve shifted my definition of financial independence to be defined by my ability to continue living my current lifestyle through gains made from investable assets.  For 2023, this limited view would generate \~$600K (after netting taxes) for spending against a lifestyle run rate which is effectively $200K.

Selling volatility has a lot of risk associated since it is leveraged. A financial independence definition that depends upon leveraged risk introduces some peace of mind issues.  This is the definition I currently use in order to claim that I am financially independent.

However, I also track a definition of financial independence that is virtually risk free: FI is when my run rate of life expenses is below the interest that can be earned from buying 30-year treasuries. At 4% yield this would generate \~$190K after taxes. The net after tax payments would benefit from not having state income tax and our family being in a lower average tax bracket.  With my life expenses under $200K due to a lack of mortgage, I am currently bumping along on this threshold.  Half of my annual expenses are vacations and luxury items (plane maintenance is not cheap) which could easily be eliminated if we decided we wanted to retire early and spend well under the interest generated threshold.

But we won’t.

We will probably carry on because we love our work. As our investable assets increase, we will allow lifestyle creep wine, vacations, and hobbies over the coming years.

**Lessons and Observations**

1. **Perseverance Yields Results.**  Having a long history of steady savings can lead to big outcomes. While the sale of my company did create a boost in my wealth, the benefit of compounding savings over decades has lead to a greater contribution to the overall wealth.  I’ve never been one to chase quick profits or fads (crypto, though I do own $2K of Bitcoin), and instead see that the professional and technology skills that I can acquire through self-study and life experiences pay larger dividends than with gambling investments.
2. **Always Have A Project.** Whether it’s becoming an expert in a new technology, learning the nuances of how strategic business development is orchestrated, or earning a pilot’s license, having 2-3 ongoing passion projects creates contentment, builds worldly skills, and opens work / financial opportunities that I was not seeking or aware of.
3. **Culturally Fail Fast.**  I’ve been in 4 work scenarios where there was a culture mismatch. Either the people around were unpleasant or there was a limited interest in peers to socially connect. Get out of those situations as fast as possible, within days if necessary. I’ve been fortunate to listen to my inner voice and the longest I was in an unpleasant environment was 9 months. In two of these fail fast scenarios, had I stayed for more than 4 years, I would have earned more than $5M in each scenario.  They were economic mistakes but like successes.
4. **Peace Of Mind Matters More Than Profit.**  It took me the better part of my young adulthood, but I sleep peacefully by structuring my finances and earnings in such a way where I have the maximal peace of mind given my risk tolerance.  The things that eat at me would be consistently having expenses above my income and a financial independence strategy that required my net worth to decline due to withdrawals.
5. **Over Sacrificing Will Sabotage Important Relationships.**  Being aggressive in your career and sacrificing time with family, friends, and lovers hasn’t created enough of leapfrog in my FI journey that warrants the cost (often sabotage) that will come to those relationships. I was a relentless worker in my early years.  Now I am a wise worker with a structured balance between work and play.
6. **Maintain A War Time Mindset With Investing.** Invest assuming that your worst-case nightmare scenario will happen. With this mindset, every investment has risk mitigations (both in my mindset and structurally). By thinking this way, you will be prepared emotionally and skill wise to act when negative scenarios occur. I used to be apprehensive about selling volatility with reasonable risk. It requires me to do things such as selling naked calls. Most traders hear the oft repeated words, ""naked calls have unlimited loss potential!"" and immediately run for the hills. I worked for months to avoid ever having a naked call go in the money as that would be the nightmare. Well, one time it happened, they were in the money, and I was frozen. But the nightmare was much worse in my dreams, learned how to trade out of it, and recognized that trading as if everything was always in the money made everything easier to absorb. So that is how I invest and trade - it's war time, nothing will go right, and have a plan for every possible contingency.",finance,1669211914
personalfinance,Pay off student loans early or invest?,"Last year, I paid off my student loan balance of $12k. Since I was eligible for up to $20k in student loan forgiveness, I requested a full refund of those payment from my student loan servicer. Of course, now the student loan forgiveness is in limbo with all of the legal challenges. 

The combined interest rate on the loans would be around 3.8%. If the student loan forgiveness doesn't end up happening, would it make more sense to simply invest the $12k or pay off the student loans? I can see the benefits of both options. If it's invested for the long term (20+ years), it would most likely give returns anywhere from 5-8%, which is higher than the interest rate on the loans. I would likely put the majority of it in my Roth IRA with a small amount being invested in a taxable account and the rest going into a HYSA to purchase a car in the near future. So from a purely financial perspective, it seems like it would make more sense to invest the money and just continue to make the payments on the loans. 

However, there is the psychological benefit of paying off the loans and not having to worry about making those payments for the next 10 years. So, I can see the benefits for both sides, which is why I find this a difficult decision to make (on top of the fact that I can be very indecisive).

Is there anything else I should factor into making this decision?

Obviously, this really only applies if the student loan forgiveness plan doesn't come through. Otherwise, I will plan on investing/saving the refunded money anyway.

 I would appreciate any words of advice/wisdom that others can provide whether or not you have personal experience in making a similar decision.",finance,1669213045

CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Latest detailed Bankless episode - Most of the 2021 Bull run was caused by a ponzi system created by the crypto hedge funds and yield farming protocols,"**The latest detailed [Bankless episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IvAYINNcj50) is pretty brutal**. It says that the bulk of the 2021 Bull run was caused by a ponzi system created by the crypto hedge funds and yield farming protocols.

In the first 10 minutes, David straight up says that the 2021 price bull run was fueled by a giant ponzi scheme with all of DeFi and the minted shitcoins. This involved the crypto hedge funds, 3AC, Alameda, Genesis, all the CeFi companies offering interest, Yield Pools, FTX, ETH killers, and many more. His theory is that this was all fueled by CeFi lending, collaterallized loans, and other high-interest schemes.

This probably explains why David has been looking a lot more stressed in recent episodes.

####**The Super cycles**

- 2013-2014 bull market: caused by PoW copycats (OP: along with Mt. Gox and Silk Road)
- 2016-2017 bull market: caused by ICOs
- 2020-2021 bull market: caused by yield farming, which started with Compound in Dec 2020. This fed into the CeFi lending and all the crypto hedge funds. (OP: Retail also pumped a lot into both crypto and stock markets with funds from stimulus checks and quantitative easing.)

That was pretty brutal reveal, and it also might explain why David has been looking a lot more stressed in recent episodes. It's definitely a strong reverse of the typical Bankless pro-crypto stance.

####**2020 to mid-2022: 3AC, DCG, Grayscale GBTC scheme explained**

Here's my best summary. This probably isn't 100% accurate because there's so much info presented, and I don't understand every section of it:

1. Gemini Earn borrows BTC from from retail customers, which then gets lent to Genesis/DCG, which then gets lent to crypto hedge funds like 3AC
1. DCG/Genesis is the only company that can mint GBTC out of thin air
1. Unlike retail customers, 3AC is able to acquire GBTC 1:1 for BTC. It trades its BTC for GBTC and begins selling GBTC, which at that time had a premium was worth way more than BTC. 3AC kept trading BTC for GBTC and then selling GBTC, which absolutely destroyed the value of GBTC. GBTC's premium quickly became a discount. That's pretty much how 3AC made all their money.
1. With the discount, all GBTC holders are underwater compared to BTC, which is temporarily fine since BTC's value also went up. But once BTC's value falls, they're all way underwater.
1. OP: In addition, there's currently a lot of speculation on whether it actually has enough BTC collateral. GBTC acts like a futures market. GBTC only needs to redeem the amount of BTC 6 months after the redemption request, so it doesn't necessarily have to hold BTC 1:1.
1. 3AC then sold their profits and went into deep into investing into Ethereum killers like Avalanche, Solana, and Terra Luna. This whole time, their GBTC collateral is underwater compared to their BTC loans from Genesis.
1. Jerome Powell begins raising interests, starting the collapse of the Bitcoin bull market. BTC and ETH fall 50% from their ATH at the start of the year.
1. By Apr-May, the Terra Luna money making machine begins running out of steam. 3AC sells $1.5B worth of BTC for Terra's UST. Within a week, Terra's UST collapses, taking down half of the crypto hedge funds.
1. 3AC goes down under, along with Celsius, Voyager, BlockFi. 3AC being looking for funds from anyone who would lend to them. Doesn't get it and gets liquidated. Fails.
1. Genesis takes a big loss from their loan to 3AC but survive after getting bailed out from DCG.

Everyone who expected more collateral to happen due to the Terra Luna/Celsius contagion were right. It just took more months to fully-realize because companies were good at hiding it.

####**Mid-2022 to now: FTX**

1. The Terra Luna collapse is also likely when Alameda Research and FTX secretly went underwater.
1. Alameda and FTX bail out BlockFi and Voyager with lines of credit (which we now know weren't backed by anything). This builds up a lot of false trust in FTX and Alameda as the good guys.
1. FTX takes customer deposits over and over again to secretly bail out Alameda Research, which then gets sent to Genesis because Alameda Research had loans from Genesis.
- FTX core members continue to gaslight the crypto community and hide their fraud
1. FTX keeps afloat using their FTX shitcoins (FTT, SRM) as collateral. They manipulate the price and markets of their collateral by keeping the liquidity low while minting more out of thing air (through interest). The keep buying their shitcoins back to keep the prices up, and they're able to do this because they keep taking loans against these coins as collateral. That's a straight up Ponzi scheme because it's completely unsustainable.
1. The rest is history that's been covered over and over this week.

At this point, Bankless temporarily puts on ther conspiracy hats starts wondering if the SEC knew about this ahead of time and just let the house of cards fall down on its own because that would've had a bigger effect.

####**Further contagion**

1. Genesis stops withdrawals and has a $1B hole. It announces it'll go bankrupt without additional line of credit. DCG also has a $1.1B promissory note to Genesis??
1. DCG might go bankrupt. CZ takes a look and decides not to bail out DCG/Genesis/Grayscale.

####**Their conclusion**

stocks,Indicators that stocks have bottomed,"$SPX might have hit the bottom, currently down 17% from its ATH in early January, after lowest close of the year in early October (down as much as 25%). 

TL;DR

**Bottom indicators**: 

* Inflation looks to have peaked (look at CPI)
* Short-term interest rates also may have peaked (look at two-year Treasury yield)
* 10-year yield peaked (recently dropped to around 3.7%)

**Risk for more volatility** as earnings have not hit bottom. But the stock market historically hits the bottom 3-6 months before earnings estimates bottom. Falling profit projections likely include falling 10-year yield would support—or even boost—earnings multiples. 

Source: [Barron's](https://www.barrons.com/articles/stocks-bottomed-sp-500-51669155476)

&gt;For starters, the S&amp;P 500 is down 17% from its all-time high of 4796 hit in early January. It was down as much as 25% to its lowest close of the year of 3577, hit in early October. One key driver was that the Federal Reserve has been ratcheting interest rates higher in order to combat high inflation by reducing economic demand. That’s even after the inflation had already begun denting consumer demand. Plus, faster-growing technology companies have seen their valuations, or their stocks’ multiples of expected earnings, take a hit partly because higher rates make future profits less valuable. Those companies are expecting a bulk of their profits to come many years in the future.  
&gt;  
&gt;The thesis that the market has already bottomed hinges on the idea that inflation looks to have already peaked. The Consumer Price Index for October gained 7.7% year over year, down from 9.1% in June. Some of that is because higher prices, themselves, have caused consumers to turn away from shopping; retail companies have too much inventory and have had to mark prices down because demand isn’t strong enough for the supply. Plus, interest rates have already risen, though higher rates have more work to do in reducing inflation to the Fed’s 2% target.  
&gt;  
&gt;That inflation has peaked could mean short-term interest rates have also peaked. The federal-funds futures market is reflecting that the pace of rate hikes will slow down, before the Fed ultimately cuts rates in 2023. The two-year Treasury yield, a barometer for expectations about the fed-funds rate, is around 4.5%, below its multiyear peak of just over 4.7%. The assumption is that inflation and demand will be somewhat curbed by that point, so there’s a visible end to the Fed’s demand destruction. That would ultimately provide relief for the stock market.   
&gt;  
&gt;To that point, “if the economy manages to avoid recession or experiences only a modest contraction, a new bull market may already be unfolding,” wrote Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group.   
&gt;  
&gt;A peak in short-term rates could also mean the 10-year yield, a key component to stock-market forecasts, has also peaked. Higher short-term rates have played a role in pushing the 10-year yield higher this year, but recently, the 10-year yield has dropped to around 3.7% from a multiyear peak of just over 4.2%. That’s partially because higher short-term rates should ultimately reduce demand and long-term inflation, lowering the yield on the long-dated bond. That’s key for stocks because a lower yield on 10-year government debt increases the value of future profits, boosting equity valuations.  
&gt;  
&gt;All of these indicators, though, do point to weakening economic demand. Earnings forecasts might have to decline in the next few quarters. Wall Street hasn’t cut earnings estimates for 2023 as much as they have historically by the end of a calendar year. And this isn’t a normal year; earnings pressure could be worse, given the risk of a recession.   
&gt;  
&gt;But the stock market would likely resume rising before actual earnings results hit bottom. The stock market historically tends to hit bottom three to six months before earnings estimates bottom, according to RBC data. To be sure, if profit forecast drop enough, stocks would find a new bottom. But if earnings expectations drop even by 11% from here, and the S&amp;P 500 doesn’t fall as much, the index would remain above its low for the year.   
&gt;  
&gt;Plus, an environment with profit projections falling likely includes falling bond yields. If company earnings—and stocks—are declining, then investors could rush into safe 10-year government bonds, the interest payments of which are guaranteed. That would bring the 10-year bond’s price up, and yield down. The yield is attractive anyway, as it’s well above average annual inflation expectations for the next decade of 2.31%. In this scenario, a falling 10-year yield would support—or even boost—earnings multiples even while earnings projections are dropping.   
&gt;  
&gt;If it sounds like stock market volatility is in store overall, that’s because it is. The S&amp;P 500 could even revisit its low for the year.",finance,1669224002

I am trying to assume a mortgage from a friend of mine who is selling his house because his interest rate is around 2%. The issue is his equity is about $65,000. I could probably come up with $40,000 in cash, but it is difficult to come up with more as it is tied up in investments that I don’t want to sell. Am I able to take out a loan to cover the rest? I know it is challenging taking loans out for down payments, and don't want to accidentally commit mortgage fraud or anything…. Thanks for the help!

stocks,Only 2 ways to look at this market going forward,"It seems the Bulls and Bears are as split as ever now that we're in the middle of another major market rally. There has also been a lot of discussion on if we're in a recession currently, or if we have yet to see the real recession. 

Bulls say we haven't seen unemployment rise significantly, so we can't be in a recession regardless of the 2 negative Q's we saw in the first half. Bears say we are about to go into a recession (if we aren't already) and employment is always lagging.

This got me thinking, there are only 2 ways to look at this market from here:

1. The recession started at the beginning of the year, and we were in it until end of Q2 basically. This would line up with the fact that the market bled out all year to price in the 2 negative quarters we had. Q3 GDP was positive, and Q4 Atlanta Fed GDP forecast is showing growth again, so stocks have bottomed.
2. We are not and have not been in a recession this year. The entire down move in the market over the last \~10-11 months was multiple compression, and next year we see the impact of rate increases on the economy, and that's when we get a real earnings contraction + higher unemployment.

Is it dumb to buy a home in this environment, expecting rates to fall longer term/being able to refinance the mortgage at a lower rate? In this case, the mortgage amount would be lower (house values are lower) and, after maybe a couple years of high interest, maybe rates will lower again, which someone could re-finance into.

I had a very strong grip on my finances when I first started college but things happened junior/senior year that almost ruined it all. Now I started my full-time job post-graduation and need help figuring out how to live off of this (I know I am actually making more money at this job but genuinely feels like I made more money serving in college). Below is my breakdown of finances:

**Take-Home Pay:** Roughly $3,200/month after taxes, HDHP health/dental/vision insurance, HSA (I max this out for annual contribution), 401k Roth contribution at 6% to get full match. I get 65k gross annually, my job also will not let me work anywhere else or do anything like Uber due to independence issues without multiple levels of approval, already got denied once for asking to serve on the weekends

**Monthly Expenses:**

$770/mo rent including all utilities for 1b1b in a 4b4b (flat every month, lease ends in July and will be moving, this is absurdly cheap rent I will not find anywhere else but they are raising and also can't live here past this lease since I am not a student anymore, average currently is about $1200-$1500 where I live in metro AZ)

Storage Unit: $144/mo (has furniture for the apartment, the current one is furnished but the old one was unfurnished, will definitely be moving to an unfurnished place in July 2023)

Phone/Watch Plan and Payment: $166/mo 

Subscriptions (Netflix, YNAB, 1Password, Switch Online, Anti-virus, Costco Membership that I set aside money each month for the annual renewal price): $57/mo

Personal Loan Pmt: $328/mo 25.78% opened Feb 2022 payoff in Feb 2027 (already tried refinancing but it is too soon)

Car Loan: $355/mo 2.99% payoff in Dec 2025

Gas: \~$130/mo (9/10 times I get gas at Costco)

Car Insurance: $150/mo

Private Student Loan: $91/mo (full repayment starts in Feb 2023, this is interest only payment until grace ends)

Federal Student Loans totaling $28k without Biden forgiveness (I would qualify for $10k forgiveness if it goes through, welcome to payment plan recommendations since grace ends in Feb 2023 and pause may end earlier than June 2023) 

Groceries: $300/mo roughly (I shop decently I think, I go mostly to Costco/Aldi with a few items at other chain stores as needed)

Therapy: roughly $200/mo but I use my HSA contributions to pay that and most other medical expenses if HSA has enough to cover it so that doesn't come out of my take-home pay

**CC Debts:** $1607 balance, paying $100/mo to payoff completely before 0% interest ends on this card. $1545 balance where interest begins on statement generating in a couple of weeks at 23.24%. I have been throwing as much extra leftover money at the card with interest starting soon (I have another CC doing 0% bal tran interest for 15 months and 3% fee where I can transfer about $1100 of the $1545 balance to this card, the apr would expire in 15 months). 

Technically I do have money left over without counting my unplanned monthly incidentals but I want suggestions on how to lower my monthly expenses so I can pay off both of these credit cards ASAP and throw money at my personal loan until I can refinance. I also have 0 emergency fund whatsoever and want to try to build that too due to current economic conditions, especially before my expected substantial rent/utilities hike in July 2023 when I move. Please don't judge where I am at overall financially, I did what I had to do to get by while working 2-3 jobs throughout the last 2-3 years of college with almost 0 help from family for the costs of school or living. I am just trying to fix this now and leave this in the past with no judgment. I am barely scraping by right now but still have not been late on anything in my life but I feel like the first late payment will happen soon. 

My current idea is to pause my 401k roth contributions until I get rid of my CC debt ($150 every biweekly check goes to 401k roth) and throw that every 2 weeks at my debt in addition to other leftover money I can spare. TIA, let me know if you need more information will happily provide some.",finance,1669226991

CryptoCurrency,"Fed officials see smaller rate hikes coming 'soon,' minutes show",,cryptocurrency,1669230149
stocks,"Fed officials see smaller rate hikes coming ‘soon,’ minutes show","Federal Reserve officials earlier this month agreed that smaller interest rate increases should happen soon as they evaluate the impact policy is having on the economy, meeting minutes released Wednesday indicated.

Reflecting statements that multiple officials have made over the past several weeks, the meeting summary pointed to small rate hikes are coming. Markets widely expect the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee to step down to a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, following four straight 0.75 percentage point hikes.

Though hinting that smaller moves were ahead, officials said they still see little signs of inflation abating. However, some committee members expressed concern about risks to the financial system should the Fed continue to press forward at the same aggressive pace.

“A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated. “The uncertain lags and magnitudes associated with the effects of monetary policy actions on economic activity and inflation were among the reasons cited regarding why such an assessment was important.“

The minutes noted that the smaller hikes would give policymakers a chance to evaluate the impact of the succession of rate hikes.

The summary noted that a few members indicated that “slowing the pace of increase could reduce the risk of instability in the financial system.” Others said they’d like to wait to ease up on the pace. Officials said they see the balance of risks on the economy now skewed to the downside.

Markets had been looking for clues about not only what the next rate hike might look like but also for how far policymakers think they’ll have to go next year to make satisfactory progress against inflation.

Officials at the meeting said it was just as important for the public to focus more on how far the Fed will go with rates “and the evolution of the policy stance thereafter, had become more important considerations for achieving the Committee’s goals than the pace of further increases in the target range.“

In recent days, officials have spoken largely in unison about the need to keep up the inflation fight, while also indicating they can pull back on the level of rate hikes. That means a strong likelihood of a 0.5 percentage point increase in December, but still an uncertain course after that.

Markets expect a few more rate hikes in 2023, taking the funds rate to around 5%, and then possibly some reductions before year end.

The post-meeting statement from the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee added a sentence that markets interpreted as a signal that the Fed will be doing smaller increases ahead. That sentence read, “In determining the pace of future increases in the target range, the Committee will take into account the cumulative tightening of monetary policy, the lags with which monetary policy affects economic activity and inflation, and economic and financial developments.“

Investors saw it as a nod to a reduced intensity of hikes following four straight 0.75 percentage point increases that took the Fed’s benchmark borrowing overnight borrowing rate to a range of 3.75-4%, the highest in 14 years.

Several Fed officials have said in recent days that they anticipate a likely half-point move in December.

“They’re getting to a point where they don’t have to move so quickly. That’s helpful since they don’t know exactly how much tightening they’re going to have to do,” said Bill English, a former Fed official now with the Yale School of Management. “They emphasize policy works with lags, so it’s helpful to be able to go a little bit more slowly.“

Inflation data lately has been showing some encouraging signs while remaining well above the central bank’s 2% official target.

The consumer price index in October was up 7.7% from a year ago, the lowest reading since January. However, a measure the Fed follows more closely, the personal consumption expenditures price index excluding food and energy, showed a 5.1% annual rise in September, up 0.2 percentage points from August and the highest reading since March.

Those reports came out after the November Fed meeting. Several officials said they viewed the reports positively but will need to see more before they consider easing up on policy tightening.

The Fed has been the target lately of some criticism that it could be tightening too much. The worry is that policymakers are too focused on backward-looking data and missing signs that inflation is ebbing and growth is slowing.

However, English expects the Fed officials to keep their collective foot on the break until there are clearer signals that prices are falling. He added that the Fed is willing to risk a slowing economy as it pursues its goal.

“They have risks in both directions if doing too little and doing too much. They’ve been fairly clear that they view the risks of inflation getting out of the box and the need to do a really big tightening as the biggest risk,” he said “It’s a hard time to be Jay Powell.”

# NFTs:

Am I the only one who thinks saying the word NFT out loud is kinda awkward? It seems like ever since the images of monkeys being sold for thousands upon thousands of dollars that it gave the word NFT a bad connotation. Although I have fallen in love with the concept and use cases of NFTs, I personally believe the term should be altered to attract more users. But hey, that's just my opinion.

1. **CNFT Outfitters:**

“CNFT Outfitters, the first blockchain driven clothing store.” 

1. Not my most favorite idea that I have had, however, within the context of real world use, it solves a “problem” so to speak. The problem isn't much of a problem but more of a real world reason to indulge in NFT purchasing. When conversing with everyday people about NFTs, they simply do not get it, and I think we can all come up with an example of when we talked to someone who scoffed at NFTs as some sort of joke. These are the same people who screenshot NFTs on Opensea and then jab at how it was free to obtain the image. 
2. When talking about getting regular individuals into blockchain and especially NFTs, something that they already purchase such as goods like clothing, needs to be on-chain. A way to put an item on-chain is to simply tokenize it. This is what CNFT Outfitters does. It tokenizes your favorite waifu pillow so it can be added to the ledger. 
3. Now this idea branches off into other ideas such as tokenizing goods and services as a whole. It brings up questions such as “why can't we have a NFT grocery store,” “We can tokenize music songs.” Any and all are of course valid, I simply chose to use clothes as a primary example. 
4. Some of you might wonder how a user receives a real world item through blockchain. It's possible, just as it was possible for Beeple to send out his real world items to his customers. 
   1. Although I may be mistaken because it is fairly early to say -  the Midnight sidechain may be the answer when it comes to protecting sensitive information such as personal names and addresses while also shipping them real world items. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have more information and notes on this specific idea and topic if anyone is interested. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. **CNFT Lottery:**

Imagine a lottery system where you have higher chances of winning compared to traditional lottery systems. Where proceeds can be distributed to organizations/groups/individuals in need, and is provably fair. This is where the CNFT Lottery comes into play. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Say you want to enter in a chance to win ₳10,000. Fortunately you can by simply purchasing an NFT. Similar to how traditional lottery systems work, you purchase your “lottery ticket” and patiently wait for a winner to be drawn. After some time, your NFT transitions, letting you know if you are a winner or not. If you are a winner, your winnings are instantly sent to your wallet. 
2. Now this idea and concept is my latest one and is by default the idea I'm most excited about because it seems like no one is doing this right now.  This is how it could work - keep in mind that all numbers are for example only and are arbitrary.
   1. First off, if you are wondering if this idea is executed as a smart contract, native asset or both, I couldn't tell you. I am not that savvy when it comes to how more complex NFTs work on Cardano. However, I did ask around and at least this seems possible, which is exciting! 
   2. Project Cottery (get it, cardano-lottery? Call it whatever you want, this is made up for the example) sells 10,000 CNFTs for ₳50 and offers a grand prize of ₳15,000. The NFTs are not “visible” to the purchaser yet. For now, imagine them as a blurred image at the time of purchase. Let's say you purchase one of these “hidden” NFTs, this immediately and automatically enters you in a chance to win the grand prize or jackpot. 
   3. The jackpot has a rarity of 1. Meaning that out of the 10,000 NFTs there is only one jackpot. There can be more winning levels, such as a level two or Tier 2 Winnings. Tier 2 Winnings can have a payout of ₳7,500 with a rarity of 2 (1/5000 odds of winning). So you can start to see how you can add more levels of winnings. However, in this example, the larger the winning payouts are, the less of a profit margin there is unless you increase the NFT price. For this example we have 5 tiers.  
      1. Tier 1: ₳10,000 Jackpot 1 of 1
      2. Tier 2: ₳7,500  2 of 2 
      3. Tier 3: ₳3,500 3 of 3
      4. Tier 4: ₳500 4 of 4
      5. Tier 5: ₳30 5 of 5 
   4. With the set of numbers above we can say that the sales batch total is ₳500,000 (₳50 x 10,000). The total winning payout cost is ₳42,650. What is left over after paying out is ₳457,350 (which is worth $142,680.23 USD at the time of writing this.) In order for Project Cottery to be able to afford the winning payout, it needs to sell a minimum of 853 NFTs.
   5. Think of it like this, you are given a paper slip to write your name on. On the back of that slip (unbeknownst to you) is what the prize is, it could be the jackpot or it could be a dud. You write your name on the front of the paper and let's say that on the backside is the jackpot. There is no way (physically impossible) for you to be able to tell what is on the back of your paper slip until after the draw. You can only see the paper name side up.  You then place your paper in the hat and wait for at least 852 other names to also be placed in the hat. After the minimum number of named slips that the hat needs has been satisfied, the hat is then tossed in the air and every paper lands name up. What is different now is that you are allowed to turn your paper over to see if you wrote your name on a winning slip. Luckily, you won the jackpot. By simply looking at the other side of the slip, the winnings are instantly handed to you, hell, the back side of the slip might as well be the jackpot itself.
   6. The hidden NFTs and the prizes attached to them are generated at true random and you buy one (writing your name on the slip). By simply holding the NFT in your wallet you are “placing your slip in the hat.” You then wait for the minimum to be sold. Once the minimum has been sold the “draw” begins. All of the “hidden” or blurred NFTs have now transitioned to something you can see, (“turned over”) and exposes the winnings to you. The winnings are then automatically and instantly transacted into your wallet. 
   7. This concept has its share of problems and important questions such as, how do we make sure that it is a fair and equal “draw,” and how do we make sure that the minimum sale is met? 
   8. The fairness of the draw is written in the code of the system itself. Meaning that Bob nor anyone else has a higher chance of choosing the winning NFTs. To ensure the minimum sale is met is slightly more complicated but most certainly obtainable. First, we need to make sure that all of the NFTs expose their winnings to the customers simultaneously. If we want the prizes to be sent automatically and immediately from the generated sales pool then we need to make sure that the minimum is met first. I.e. you cannot give out ADA that you do not have. Having the winning payout be generated from the sales makes the project self sustainable. Meaning that if there aren't sales, there isn't a project (there's only winners if there are players). Two of the options that we have are that the project either remains open until the minimum is met or a time period is set for the minimum to be satisfied. The latter is less appealing but gives a guarantee if the project follows through or not. Meaning that if the sales are not met within let's say, 2 weeks, the project refunds its customers and restarts, instead of potentially making customers wait months for sales to accumulate. 

There is a lot more to this particular idea and topic that we could dive into but I will leave it at that for now.

# dApps/SaaS:

**Distributr:**

Distributr - The automatic and decentralized funds distributing application. 

1. Let’s say that you are the owner of a small restaurant and only have a couple of employees. Instead of you and or the employee keeping track of each hour worked you decide to pay the percentage to everyone who takes part in the business. 
2. For example; A customer comes into your restaurant and orders a drink for 5 DJED. You, as the fair and honest business owner that you are, have decided that for every dollar your business receives, 25 cents or 25% goes to you, 25% goes to the company itself, 15% goes to the manager, 8.75% goes to Tom, 8.75% goes to Clair, 8.75% goes to Wanda and the final 8.75% goes to George. Because the manager and the crew know that they receive a percentage of every dollar that flows into the company, it could be a major contributing factor as to how the employee treats their customers, the business and themselves. Meaning their work ethic could improve if they are away they could make more if they work harder. 
   1. I am aware that a pessimistic viewpoint would ask “why would anyone work harder knowing their lazy counterpart gets the same cut?'' This problem can be solved in many different ways and shouldnt be considered a large setback for such an application.
3. Say Tom is taking a two week vacation and Clair will be filling in his position. Well we can just take Tom off of the distribution schedule and replace him with Clair until he returns. Meaning that distribution to different wallets can be turned off, on, paused, and even scheduled for future events. 
4. Now let’s say that Clair decides to use Distributr for when she gets paid. She has one wallet but multiple addresses in that wallet for her different accounts. A billing account, savings account, tax savings, and investment account respectively. Clair adjusts her setting on her app to where 15% of every dollar that is sent to her wallet address  is automatically sent to her tax savings account, 10% is sent to her savings, and the remaining 70% is divided up between her expenditure and investment accounts. 
5. With an application like this, you can begin to see how easy it is to automatically budget, save money, and invest. This could even be used for an entire household, business, any individual or anything with a wallet address. Say your actual home address has a wallet address. Anytime a family member or friend wants to gift the Blane household, the sender can send it to the home’s wallet address and watch as it gets divided up into portions for each individual on the wallets distribution list. 
6. Of course Distributr makes its revenue by taking a percentage of what its users receive, like a transaction fee.  
7. This idea is less thought out and has more kinks in it than my other ideas. Some kinks that may be more obvious and prevalent to you than to me but all could be worked out later. I really like the concept of automatically distributing assets when they are sent to my wallet.

# Non-profit, Volunteer, Environmentalist Groups: 

**Environmentally friendly group/tree planting:**

1. I think this section is fairly straightforward and self explanatory. Simply put - the idea consists of individuals donating their precious crypto to a group of motivated individuals that perform acts of good. I am sure you can imagine a group similar to Team Trees that instead of 1 dollar is 1 tree planted, 3 ADA is 1 tree planted (or what have you). This sort of model works well because it takes the physical work away from the individual but still makes them feel as if they contributed to helping the environment.

We are the designers and engineers and visionaries that need to make it easier for today's people to use this technology. This tech needs to be easy to understand, easy to use and actually useful for everyday people. It needs to make sense to the everyday person. It needs to grab the individual and make them say “wow, why haven't I been using this before?”

personalfinance,Advice funding a replacement car,"I just had my vehicle totaled in an accident, and of course being the genius I am, I did not have full coverage insurance (/s). 

I had paid 3500 for the car two summers ago (right before the prices of cars shot up from shortages), and when everything shut down and I was trying to pinch pennies, I took off coverage other than basic liability. I wasn't driving much anyway, and the car wasn't worth a lot to replace. Seemed like a solid financial decision at the time.   


Well, obviously it wasn't. Because now I'm down to one vehicle between my wife and I (which is not going to work logistically) and used cars in the same condition now cost almost double that. If I had the cash on hand to just replace it, I would. In the past, I would just take out a car loan and pay it out happily for a few years. But the current market puts people in a weird predicament:  


1) A half decent used vehicle apparently now costs more than the average person has on hand in cash

2) Banks won't give car loans to vehicles older than \~10 years.

Which now leads me to wonder, how are people buying cars?! The inflated price is obviously coming from the fact that people are willing to pay that much now versus a few years ago, but I'm at a loss as to how to proceed.   


My options, as I see them, are to either spend a LOT more on a more recent car that I can finance with a bank, or take out some sort of personal loan or something at a higher interest rate to pay it out. This seems like a bad idea. What other options should I consider?",finance,1669236947

Why did it fall if lots of money vanished, that was never actually in BTC in the first place?

I mean, for the price to lower there must be selling pressure but who would actually sell now? Surely any true BTC believer is buying now, not selling at a low price.",cryptocurrency,1669239142

personalfinance,What Can I Do Next? (Refinanced student loans and recent job loss),"I feel somewhat defeated by events over the last few months and am wondering if anyone has any advice or encouragement as I try to improve my finances. Essentially, I have 190k of student loan debt, which was once over 250k. I also (unfortunately) refinanced my student loan in late 2018, as it was so big I needed a way for my payments to make an actual dent. Now, I'm forced to keep paying my loan while others either don't pay or can make interest free payments due to the federal interest freeze. I also just got laid off, and it seems my once strong progress is falling apart. Here's a timeline of the steps I took:

\- Graduated in 2011 from law school (this is where the massive debt comes from)

\- Got a law job in compliance in 2012, and my salary went over 100k in late 2015. by this point, I had eliminated all other debt I had (mainly a credit card)

\- By 2017, I had 100k in savings and started making bigger payments on my student loan

\- By late 2018, I refinanced my student loan and also began investing into my 401k

\- Other problems began in 2018, when my parents started having massive financial issues, which would continue on until mid-2022. During this 4 year span, I also had to help them with about 45k in cash to get them out of their own bad situation. Luckily, they are doing well now and need no further help. While some may criticize the amount I had to give them, there was no way around this. My parents had completely lost any idea on how to manage money, and as a person of Asian descent, there was no other way out of this one but for the son to step up. 

\- In 2021, I moved to a different job for the first time, and took a lower salary as the last place had been acquired and became very difficult to work in, with the chance of redundacy increasing (work started at 4 am, and would still include evening calls at 6 or 7 pm multiple times a week, my health started going down). 

\- In 2021, since i'd already refinanced in 2018 and was no longer eligible for an interest freeze federally I refinanced my student loan again and brought it down to 3% interest.

\- In Nov 2022, I got laid off from that new job. Luckily, I have a few hundred shares of equity which I can sell when that company exits (hopefully in 2-3 years).

\- I now need to find a new job and am working towards that. I got very little in severance and with the market going to crap I am likely to burn through some savings until my next role. 

My overall stats as I sit here in late Nov 2022: 

\- 90k in Savings

\- 35k in retirement accounts

\- 190k of student loan debt

My plan is that when I can get this new job, I will go all out on the student loan and try to pay it off in 5 years. I will also need to replenish my savings based on whatever gets used up during this period of unemployment.",finance,1669245007

Bitcoin,"Bitcoin at 16k, why not go all in","Bitcoin at 16k, should I go all in?

I'm really struggling not to go all in right now. I DCA since the 50k level last year and my avg is 25k right now, pretty good in my eyes considering I discovered crypto in 2021. Bitcoin is presently 33% of my investing portfolio and I want more. I 100% believe in the Bitcoin ecosystem and future value that it will bring to society. I see Bitcoin right now as a store of value, I hope it's gonna grow to become much more.

From my perspective Bitcoin can go to 10k maybe but I don't see lower valuation than that. I'm presently watching the 13.5k-14k level with the 400W MA in mind. Considering it's been 1 year since the ATH and 1442 days since the 2018 bottom, I feel like the bottom is in or we are 1-3 months away. Just to keep in mind the 2018 bottom was 1428 days after the 2015 bottom.

Now from the Macro perspective with the FED moves, if we see inflation continue to go down in december CPI, the FED might start slowing down the rate hikes to 0.50 for next meeting and maybe 0.25 for the next one. The FED will not be able to keep raising rates when the unemployment will start to moon. If we keep in mind that markets always price in future event at least 6 months away, the 2023 recession would already be priced in or it is presently being priced in. For that to happen we have to see inflation go down first.

With all the blood on the street, isn't the best time to buy?

So why not go all in at these level? Maybe it's the bottom, maybe we will see another 50% drawdown, I don't know but it seems logic to me long term buying Bitcoin at 15-16k. In the long run it won't make a difference.

I don't really know what to expect for the next cycle, at least 100k maybe 200k??

I’ve tried making my own, but have found that the percentage of federal taxation varies between pay stubs and I’m tired of trying to figure it out on my own.

personalfinance,Best Way To Go About This Credit Debt Situation?,"**Situation:**

Income- $5,100/mo after deductions 

CC debt - $25,000 (25% APR) 

Expenses - $2,000/mo. (Rent, food, utilities, phone, gym, etc. No car loan or student debt)    

To make it long story short, I had a business and took the risk of using my credit cards to keep up with my living expenses and the biz alive. It was break even and the credit card debt slowly added up over the years ($25,000 to be exact) across 4 banks. Sure hindsight 2020, it was my complacency and fault it didn’t work.   

So I decided to do the biz on the side while working another job at a high end country club. Things were great, paying off debt, then boom fired. *(Whole different story but it was frivolous, Manager found out I used to have a thing with his gf. She told him I guess since she treated me nicely and he got jealous. Small world)*

So while unemployed I used the CC’s to pay bills. After a while I couldn’t pay the minimums because all my cash was stuffed into them to pay them off  2 creditors (JPM and Discover) decided to suspend the accounts  Meanwhile the other 2 kept my accounts open during the 4-5 months I couldn’t make payments… because well rent and food. I even told them when they called, “Hey I’m in a bind. I plan to pay them back. I’ve an offer letter I can email you, I have background check, drug test, onboarding, etc to deal with, it’ll be about 1-2 months until my first paycheck  

So now that I’ve a job and my credit score is absolute trash at ~380. I’ve decided ok well screw JPM and Discover for not working with me, I’ll pay the other 2 off first.   

**Question 1)** Credit Karma simulates my score won’t budge when I pay off the accounts that AREN’T suspended. My credit score has multiple 90 day late payments on it. It’s trashed, what really can happen if I just not pay JPM and Discover until the other 2 are paid off entirely?  

**Question 2)** My vehicle is 25 years old. No creditor will entertain my desire for a car loan although it’s a tangible item they can repossess unlike CC purchases… Will I even be able to buy a modern used vehicle still under warranty by my 30th birthday in a couple years?

**Question 3)** What if I just ignore the suspended accounts? I’ve zero incentive to pay them off. They didn’t work with me meanwhile the other 2 did. Why allocate money to a debt I won’t ever get to use again meanwhile the other 2 I’ve already been able to use now that I’m current with my payments (No. I do not use them)  

I’m sure I’ll be downvoted but again, I’ve always had a 700+ credit score, hated getting hard inquiries and always kept it below 2, never missed a payment until this summer.  Thank you, all -Josh",finance,1669264849

personalfinance,Considering a Second Home - please help,"Hi all - need some help brainstorming this.  

I currently own the home my wife, kids and I live in.  It's a growing market that has appreciated a lot in the last 10 years or so, and the house is now worth about $850k, with about $375k left in payments (so ~$475k in equity).  The mortgage is a 30 year, 3.5% interest rate, relatively low taxes.

My wife and I have decided to move to a faraway area of the US in the next 1-3 years.  Housing prices will be fairly similar there, and we will want to buy a home there as well.  We are hoping to stay at about $1M for a purchase price.

Convention says to just sell our current house and use the proceeds for a down payment on a new house.  But the interest rate on our current home is so low that it is hard to give up. According to calculators and real estate brokers, we could rent out our current house for about $500 to $700 more each month than we pay for the mortgage.  That's good because we would need to hire a property manager to help maintain the place when we move away.  I also don't particularly want to be involved with vetting tenants, applications, collecting rent directly, etc., if possible.

I'm at an inflection point now because if we want to own both homes, we essentially need to start saving now for a down payment on the second home and devote almost all of our excess cash each month to that fund for the next 1-3 years.  That would mean a pause for any new funds going into our retirement accounts (minus 401k match), no big new expenditures, etc.  We already have a large emergency fund.  But the mantra would be to hunker down and save.  

I'm leaning towards trying to keep the first house.  I think in 10-15 years, the equity gained from both will probably outstrip any short term pain with down payments and cash.  And the rent being covering the mortgage means it should be relatively low risk, minus costs of repairs and unexpected things like tenant not paying rent.  I would definitely need to double our emergency fund to cover potential repairs on both houses.  But overall, I'm guesstimating it would be all be relatively close to even on the first home.

What other considerations should I have here?  Will it be extremely difficult to get a second mortgage while holding onto the first one?  Will this impact my taxes in a meaningful way?  It looks like rental income must be counted as income, and I wouldn't be able to deduct mortgage interest on a second home, so that will probably hurt a bit.  What else?",finance,1669266410

13. Elon’s going to make the blue check mark accessible to all for $8 (or the purchasing power equivalent in your country) and also reward content creators.

22. Apparently, Twitter has a program called Birdwatch that could be used to add “readers notes” to misleading tweets about Cardano. Maybe we should look into this to combat the psyops against Cardano. [https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1587774389264973826](https://twitter.com/micsolana/status/1587774389264973826)

25. There is speculation that the November announcement might be the actual building of a PEReDi (Privacy Enhanced Regulated Distributed) CBDC.

31. The way they’re currently structured and operating, a lot of DAOs may get smashed as regulators will just view them as on-chain corporations who sold early stage securities to non-accredited investors.

36. There’s a whole crypto twitter drama happening right now with the finances of FTX and Alameda that has apparently led to Binance announcing that they will sell their FTX Token holdings (Nov. 6).

38. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

50. Here’s a nice video of Charles crushing the kid from The OC (who is now a middle aged crypto critic) along with some other person who says that “crypto has ruined lives.” The actor basically thinks that every cryptocurrency is just a security.

62. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

66. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US.

I was eating in my room (kept door closed because she'll be all over me for food if I let her stay in the room; she is fed regularly with snacks but always acts like she's hungry). 

So I closed the door to eat. Now she has a scratching post and scratching board to keep her busy in quiet moments, but instead she rather jump on counters (which I hate) and this time I had a turkey in the kitchen sink still in its packaging thawing out to take to my Mom's for Thanksgiving. Well, about an hour ago I left my room after eating and she was sitting on the kitchen floor (likely jumping off counter when she heard me coming) like nothing happened. 
I looked in the sink and there was a chunk of turkey eaten out. This pissed me off because now I have a messed up turkey. Still going to use it but wash it in and out like you normally would with meat, anyway. But I'm also pissed off because I have to worry about her possibly getting sick or even developing worms (?). Would this happen. Can my kitten (she's a rescue and I think she's about 3 or 4 months old) get sick or worse from this?? And what can I do?

We bought a house a few years ago, but we want to upgrade because it is small and we don’t like the layout (it is a bilevel). 

How do people go about moving in this situation without buying the new house contingent on the sale of the first house? We’re in good financial shape, but don’t have enough saved to buy a house outright, and houses here start at $500k for anything less than 50 years old.

Here are some relevant financial details:

-	Current mortgage: $425k @ 2.75%
-	Current home value: $600k
-	Target home price: $650k-$850k
-	Debt: None
-	Credit Rating: High
-	Income: $200k
-	Savings: $30k
-	Roth IRA, Stocks, 401k: ~$400k
-	Qualified for VA loan and current loan is a VA loan
-	Timeline: Want to move in the next 1-2 years, when we see the right house hit the market

I understand we’ll be sacrificing the interest rate on the old home. We don’t want to buy contingent as it will make us less competitive to buyers. But I don’t think we’ll qualify outright for a $650k loan while we have a $450k loan. I’m sure our old house will sell quickly, but we have kids and a dog so we don’t want to have to move into an interim solution. Especially since we want to be able to wait for the right new house to come along.

I just don’t see a simple hop scotch solution to this and I’m wondering how people handle it. Thanks a lot!",finance,1669298465
investing,When Does Duration Matter for Bond Funds?,"When holding bond funds, when does the duration *actually* matter? You are holding a long-term bond fund and the following happens:

1. Interest rates start to fall
2. Bond prices for bonds in the fund increase
3. Manager sells bonds whose maturities become too short as defined in the prospectus
4. The bonds sold in step 3 are sold at a capital gain
5. New long-term bonds are added to the fund with lower yields 

In this example, should the fund's price rise in proportion to the fund's duration? 

If the bond fund's price really changes in proportion with duration, why? New bonds at lower interest rates are being added while older ones are being sold at a premium, so over the long-term I wouldn't expect interest rates to have any effect on the overall value of the fund.

Maybe the only time bond-fund duration matters is when you have a time constraint on your investments? E.g. if you're set to retire in 3 years, is it a good idea to reduce your bond-fund duration to around 3 years?",finance,1669298621

CryptoCurrency,"Understanding Curve's new stablecoin, LLAMMA","Curve launched their Stablecoin whitepaper today, called **LLAMMA (lending-liquidating amm algorithm)**

I will try to explain the concept and working of LLAMMA.

The design of the stablecoin has few concepts: lending-liquidating amm algorithm (LLAMMA), PegKeeper, Monetary Policy are the most important ones. But the main idea is in LLAMMA: replacing liquidations with a special-purpose AMM.

Big problem with lending markets is that people can pump the spot price  of illiquid collateral, max borrow against manipulated prices, then let  their position be liquidated. But because the collateral is so illiquid,  the protocol ends up with bad debt.  See Mango-markets and CRV/AAVE just 2 days back.

So lending is inextricably dependent on AMM liquidity  But these AMMs are external, LPs can withdraw at any time, most  protocols require active governance to approve or deny new token  listings, or to modify LTV ratios in risky times.

LLAMMA solves this by making internalizing the AMM, making the  collateral token be LP shares itself  in the example of ETH collateralizing a USD stablecoin, the user would  deposit ETH as collateral, but this gets transformed into an ETH/USD LP  position

The overall schematic of LLAMMA is as shown in the figure-1:

[https://imgur.com/a/CxiQEK5](https://imgur.com/a/CxiQEK5)

The core idea of the stablecoin design is Lending-Liquidating AMM Algorithm. The idea is that it converts between collateral (for example, ETH) and the stablecoin (let’s call it USD here). If the price of collateral is high - a user has deposits all in ETH, but as it goes lower, it converts to USD. This is very different from traditional AMM designs where one has USD on top and ETH on the bottom instead.

The below image tries to explain and compare the traditional AMMs. The above paragraph is explained in the form of graph in the image below.

[https://imgur.com/a/ZRXUDEA](https://imgur.com/a/ZRXUDEA)

This transforms liquidations from a jagged, all-at-once, all-or-nothing affair with huge slippage losses  into a smooth transitioning that could even earn the collateral holder swap fees if they weather the volatility

Some people will probably dislike this, because it puts more  responsibility/risk onto the collateral holder  my counterpoint is that the risk is already there, and if you require  the protocol to internalize it then we'll see cascading collapses

The presented mechanisms can, hopefully, solve the riskiness of liquidations for stablecoin-making and borrowing purposes. In addition, stabilizer and automatic monetary policy mechanisms can help with peg-keeping without the need of keeping overly big Peg-stability modules.

stocks,There won't be any big decline,"It's been months that people are forecasting a big decline in the stock market but it hasn't happened and it won't happen in the future with the FED slowing the hiking of interest rates.

In the last 6 months the Dow Jones is up over 7%, the S&amp;P is up 1,35% and the Nasdaq is down 2%. All this amid one of the fastest interest rates increase in the last century, trade war with China and lockdowns, war in Ukraine, energy crisis, quantitative tightening, crypto crash, inflation crisis and strong dollar that caused headwinds for almost all companies. If all that didn't tank the market in the last 6 months, nothing will. If you think a mild recession in the US will cause the stock market to drop hugely from this level you're delusional because we already know a recession will happen and it will be counterbalanced by the FED pausing the hiking of interest rates and maybe China reopening.

We're seeing that the job market is still strong and as long as people are getting paid and have a job the demand won't collapse. The job market will cool a bit, enough to reduce inflation but we won't have massive layoffs...only some companies in the tech industry saw some big layoffs but that's because they hired way too much in the first place when the times were good. 

Energy and commodities prices are also down a lot and that was the biggest contributor to inflation, the CPI will decline every month and in 2023 it will be helped by favorable comps with last (this) year.

From now until the next quarter results I see nothing going on for the bears. The next big announcement will be the CPI in December and it will be favorable given how energy prices have collapsed. Then the FED in December will hike either 50bps or 25bps and the market will cheer by the slowing down on the increases.

gaming,All the great game devs were driven out of the industry.,"This isn’t based on anything but my personal experience and ideas and I’m more posting to get others feedback don’t take my word as truth because it isn’t, it's just my opinion and perspective. I also know I'm not the first or the only one that's thought of this.

For the last 10 or so years, the industry has been steadily regressing in many ways in my opinion. I think it started with crunch culture in the late 2000s and early 2010s. Although crunch culture had been around in gaming for decades at that point with an earlier well-known example being Halo 2. I believe in the early 2010s is when we started seeing the chickens come home to roost and started to experience the impact of it.

That’s also when we started seeing bigger publishing companies push more aggressive monetization strategies. And I don’t think I’m being off base by thinking these strategies didn’t align with the ethics of the game developers being pushed or forced to put them in their game.

Similarly, this is when the “early access” and “public beta” trend started to really take off. In the early 2010’s I was in high school in the Seattle area and my dad worked for Xbox LIVE and worked at the Redmond campus. I bring this up because back then I would get early access to projects and games much more than the average gamer. And having access to those closed beta projects really meant something back then. Then along came games like PUBG and publishing companies learned they could release unfinished games with the beta or early access tag on it and people would pay and put up with an unfinished product with the underlying belief that “it’ll be fixed by release” and the novelty that we were having early access to a game excites us despite all of the glaring flaws still present. And in doing so I believe it probably slowed down development time considerably because it forced devs to manage and patch these public servers on their beta projects in a “semi-playable” state because they had thousands to millions of people playing these unfinished games. So they had to put a lot of effort into keeping their unfinished project playable for the time being instead of further progressing actual development and fine-tuning later. This point took a bit longer than I wanted to but I think my experience does help give more perspective.

So game developers are and have been taken advantage of and put in these terrible positions with crunch and early access scams, then don’t even get the payoff when it’s released because of the shady and predatory monetization practices. Furthermore, we're now in the age of ""live service"" games so the payoff is never fully realized and the grind and player criticism never stop. And as a result, I think our brightest and best said ""screw it, I’ll go do something else. This is no longer worth my time and effort."" Game development has always been a passion job, studios like blizzard are well known for underpaying and taking advantage of their devs because they KNOW it was a lifelong dream for them. So anyone worth their salt probably got fed up and found a job in an adjacent industry for more money and less stress. 

So, what are we left with? A market that's oversaturated with subpar products when compared to games of the past. Games with UI that ""looks cool"" but doesn't even function properly, stats and functions that used to be expected just don't exist anymore. Buggy messes from even the biggest studios all the way down to actual small indie companies that never get fully addressed before moving on to the next project. ""live service"" games promise frequent updates and communication but just shit the bed on both consistently. Games are being released devoid of content that was expected on release and now is lumped into DLC or expansions because if not they would be delayed even further. Games take AGES to develop even with easier engines to manage and work with. Although crunch isn't as bad as it used to be so that's also contributing to that. Story modes and campaigns devoid of any real substance with copied and pasted assets throughout their entirety. Studios are releasing cash grabs to see how much blood you can squeeze from a stone. But my point is that it's more than just money motivated. 

Studio executives are making decisions based on money but I also think they no longer have the talent to deliver on these expectations even if they wanted to because they drove out all the developers that made it possible. It seriously feels like games are a former shell of what they were because of top-down incompetence. It's in the greedy executives' best interest to release a finished product in a reasonable time frame but they CAN'T because their dev teams SUCK. Anyone who could get a better job but stayed because they loved it probably has a better job in a different industry now, and we're left with the people who couldn't even if they wanted to/are new and still building a resume and their skillset, and will eventually get fed up like the developers before them and follow suit.",technology,1669316596

According to the CD calculators, at the end of the term, your savings will have gone from 1000 to 1010. Ten dollars for that year.

personalfinance,I need to replace my vehicle but I can't afford to.,"**Updates added, see bottom!**

I'm at a loss for what to do here. I have a 2006 Buick allure that I bought 4 years ago for $2000. It has been a good car for me, now over 350,000 kms. My grandad is a mechanic and after a recent inspection he's advised that I should look into replacing asap. I don't remember the specific issues as I'm not car-savvy, but it's not entirely safe to drive, and he doesn't recommend putting any more money into it.

For my next vehicle, I have dreamed of owning a truck. (Dream truck is a big ol' ford F150, but that's definitely way out of budget). I still want to get a truck as I very frequently find myself needing one and not having one available.

My ""options"" (which aren't really feasible but are just what's out there) are;
1. Buy something cheap/used with a line of credit I have through my bank. It has a 6.9% interest rate, so depending on the cost of the vehicle the interest alone would make in un-affordable for me.
Also if I buy something cheap that needs a lot of repairs and it gets expensive, then maybe I'm worse off than spending more outright.
2. Buy a new vehicle and try for good financing. I've heard through various people though that in my area, you currently can't find interest rates below 7%, which is the same as my line of credit. Also if buying new ends up with me having to pay more than say $500 a month I likely would be able to afford it.
3. Settle for a car, but even then it depends what I end up finding as to what I can afford. And as I said earlier, I frequently need to use a truck which is why that's what I would prefer to get.
4. Leasing?

About my finances;
I have $4000 in debt on my line of credit currently, which has a total of $30,000 available. Again though, the interest is 6.9%. Even if I only spent say, $15K, that would be around $1000 in interest alone every month.
I make $1800 a month if I'm lucky. I work close to full time hours, and hopefully will be working more soon, but so far that's all I've been making. 
I don't have any family members that can/are willing to co-sign or finance a vehicle for me.

I have done some searching online but so far nothing has panned out. Either it's a cheap used truck that needs more work than I can afford, it's a 2 hr drive just to go look at it, or it's out of my price range.
Ive even looked through every used dealer in my area, and nothing they have is in the budget for me.

I'm probably forgetting to put some info in here but idk. All of this has me super stressed out and I don't know what to do.
I live in Ontario Canada.

Update: some other details.
I would love to have a side hustle to bring in some extra cash, but I've had a hard time finding any that are good and work for me. 
I don't have kids, I'm single, but I share an apartment with my brother and his wife, and often have at least one other person in the vehicle, which is why I need at least 4 seats.

Also I just looked into my line of credit info and found a few things.
1. The interest rate is annual, which actual makes sense now that I think about it. I currently have almost $5000 on the LoC, but I'm not paying $350 in interest every month.
2. The LoC has a variable interest rate so it fluctuates. I don't understand it completely, but it shows ""CIBC Prime @ 6.45% + 4.14% = 10.59%"" so currently it's 10% interest annually.",finance,1669330731
personalfinance,Which of these approaches would be the better way to clear roughly 7K in CC debt?,"Hello all,

So a little story about how I got here. My last two years of college were pretty rough and my parents were also struggling to make ends meet. As a result, I was slowly taking out credit cards to continue paying for things when I needed to. I didn't want to add any more burdens. I would say by the time I graduated I had 4 CCs and 5K in debt. Add in some irresponsible decisions after I graduated and now I'm at 8 CCs and and about 7K in debt.

I know it's not as much and I'm not even hitting necessarily close to 10K but with student loan repayments coming in hot some time in the next 6 months or so (regardless of whether Biden's forgiveness passes or not I will still have a decent amount of student loans to pay off) I really wanted to buckle down and get some CCs paid off now that I'm a lot more financially responsible. At the moment this is my strategy:

I'm doing the snowball method until the end of the year to clear two CCs that have a relatively low balance and get 2CCs out of the way. Afterwards I'm considering the avalanche method until I get the remaining 6 paid off.

I was considering a service like Upstart where it seems I can just be given a loan of what I need, pay off all my CCs and just focus on the one loan. From what I've seen, they seem to be an ok service provided I get a relatively low interest rate. My CC with the lowest APR is at a 22.99 so getting a loan with equal or close interest would be ideal but likely impossible for me. If anyone knows of any other options I would appreciate hearing about them.

My other thought was possibly taking out another CC which has a long term 0% APR for balance transfers. I would use this card strictly for balance transfers and transfer the balance of the card I plan on paying off into this new card to avoid paying any additional interest and just keep doing that for as long as I can. This is also provided I am approved for a CC with sufficient balance (no more than 1K would be necessary) I would appreciate any good recommendations !!!

My 3rd option would just be to continue what I'm doing now at least until I boost my credit score high enough to have a better chance at either a decent loan or get a CC for balance transfers assuming I get denied with my initial attempt.

&amp;#x200B;

At the moment I have a credit score of 621 and my income after taxes and such is 3400$ after subtracting savings, food, rent and basically anything I have to pay monthly I'm looking at roughly 1300 - 1500$ per month or 325 - 375 weekly since I'm paid weekly. I'm working on getting a better job but haven't really had any luck there. My job isn't too bad but I know I can be making at least 10K - 20K more per year so hoping something pans out soon to give me more breathing room

personalfinance,Unsure about approach to buying a new family car,"I (41/M) am getting better at personal finance, but sometimes I feel stuck. I have a decision to make, and I’d love some feedback. 

I’m married and have two kids (toddler and infant). Our cars are paid off, but they’re 10 years old, small and cosmetic issues are starting to pile up. They run well, but it’s just a matter of time. I will need to buy a bigger car at some point for my growing family, one that’s safer and has more room (third-seater), especially when her family is in town.

I found a new car that has everything we want and need, and it’s $32,000. With haggling and a trade-in, let’s say it’s $30,000 even. For what it’s worth, I’ve been searching for used cars for the past few months, but wow, even 5-year-old SUVs w/40k miles go for $28k or more. Crazy.

So, here’s my question: Which do you think is the smarter choice: Buy the new car outright, pay half and finance the remaining half, or finance the whole thing? FYI, 4.9% is the best rate I can find (Navy Federal Credit Union), and I have excellent credit. Still, it’s going to be about $400-500 month. And a new bill.

Re: my finances, I am thankful I can afford any of these options. For context: I make $143k a year, spouse (41/F) is a SAHM, we have $313k in savings (largely due to an inheritance) and we have about $1,800 a month after all bills. I max out my 401k, too. 

But, I don’t know which makes me more itchy: Dropping $30k at once or shipping out $400+ month. Obviously, not paying $5-6k in interest over the life of the loan is smart. So maybe paying half upfront is better? Or just bite the bullet and buy it outright?

Thanks for your help! I’m not great at this stuff and want to make the smart financial move here. For what it’s worth, my wife says we should either buy it outright or just finance (half/half option is pointless). What do you think? What would you do?

Context: 

- 24 years old, no debt (besides a small amount of student loans at a very low interest rate)
- Roughly ~200k/yr salary pretax
- Budgeting in Mint (is there a better option there? I find it hard to stay on top of)
- Have an emergency fund of 3 months expenses in a HYSA
- Using Acorns for hands off investments, $250 recurring investment weekly 
- Will buy stocks/ETFs occasionally with a brokerage (need to be more on top of this)

My questions and concerns are about optimal retirement strategy. My current employer only offers a traditional 401k with a match up to 6%, and so I am only contributing 6%. This is in Fidelity.


I have a Roth 401k from a previous employer that has roughly 10k in it with 7k vested. This is in Schwab. 

My questions:

- From my understanding, I am not eligible for a Roth IRA due to my salary, so I will have to do a backdoor Roth. I'm really confused about this process especially since I am dealing with multiple exchanges (fidelity for my current employer, schwab from my past employer) -- should I be rolling over that Schwab Roth 401k to fidelity? should I be converting that to something else? am I screwed because it's been 4 months since I left my old job and will have to pay taxes on it?

- Should I be contributing more than 6% (past the match) at my current employers 401k plan?

- With individual Roth IRAs or backdoor Roth IRAs, am I investing in ETFs myself? Should I be tossing all of that money in SPY or VOO or something? Is it preferable to automate something like this?

Well I went to lay down and she was shaking or shivering or whatever it is. So I took her out to make sure she didn't need to potty or anything, and she went pee and poop totally normally. But was still doing the shaking.

So I fed her a little bit and its seemed to mostly die down but she is vert slightly still shaking.

Now i normally freak the f*** out when stuff like this happens. And want to know if this is just because we were gone for a few hours or what.

I do also wanna say again, that she is still acting mostly normal. She is pooping, peeing, licking, and laying down, and she isn't lethargic.",cryptocurrency,1669373397

personalfinance,"College student with $10.5k credit card debt, $10k student loan debt, struggling to make minimum payments...","I'm 23. When I was 19 I took out a credit card that I paid the balance off on every month (nice to have some money to fall back on if hard times come around).

Then the pandemic happened, and I was swimming in money (a fast food worker, regularly clocking 60 hours a week because all of a sudden everybody was trying to eat their boredom away).

I took out some more cards that I paid the balance off on every month (same logic, nice to have a fallback if something happens, world seems a wee unstable, also builds credit score, which is useful for the future).

After a while, I got burnt out, and I went to college in 2021 (I'd rather die than work exploitative service sector jobs in a crazy prison town for the rest of my life). When I moved, I was so burnt out and depressed by my time working in fast food, that I just lived off of my credit cards for my first and second semesters.

Then I got a job to start paying the balances down at the begining of my third semester (early this year), but the FED hiking interest rates has made my minimum payments almost double, and now I'm struggling to just stay financially above water (I'm a full time student). 

I was looking at my student loans servicer account the other day while trying to throw together an ""in the green"" budget for next month, and determined that my minimum payment after graduation would likely be at least $500/month, and I'm not doing terribly well in college (I plan to graduate with a 3.0 GPA on a 4.0 scale, but that's apparently really uncompetitive b/c I'm competing with a bunch of people who have been 4.0 students for their entire lives, meaning future job prospects are pretty iffy, especially when you factor in the recent tech layoffs (CIT major)).

I'm in about a -$300 monthly hole. I'm applying for SNAP, which should help, and I've already cut most unnecessary spending, but I don't see good prospects going forward (interest rate hikes are starting to impact business at the fast food joints I work at, and I fear a recession could push me into bankruptcy if it happens over the summer when I don't have access to student loan funds).",finance,1669386937

We’ve discussed and she’s pursuing the 10 year loan forgiveness program (PSLF) but the amount of interest that’s going to pile on over the years is frightening. It also doesn’t seem feasible to actually pay it off. Any words of advice would be appreciated.

Since we’ve talked about PSLF, it seems there isn’t much more we can do but make the monthly payments and wait. We are planning to get a house and start a family in the next 2 years.  Thanks in advance.",finance,1669389638

1) Max out HSA
2) Create Roth IRA max $6,000 contribution
3) General HYSA Savings (to have access to a down payment) to about 25% of desired home price.

I was finally feeling like I was in an okay place financially. I spent the first decade of my post-college life as the sole earner in 2-, 3-, and 4-person households. I'm a teacher, so I'm really bringing in the big bucks, lol. 

But for the past two years, I've finally been in a 2-person 2-income household. I've been able to put money into my savings account! It's been awesome! I had a little over $20,000 in there and I was feeling secure for the first time in ever. 

One of the bathrooms in my fixer-upper house was unusable, so it was time to get that fixed. About $5000, but that would be fine. I actually paid most of it out of my checking account as the progress was made, rather than moving money into savings each month. Still feeling fine.

Then my car died (15 years old, over 220k miles, served me well). The car market is just awful right now, but I figured I could just stop putting extra on my mortgage each month and use that as a car payment. I took $7000 out of savings as a down payment. Not feeling quite as comfortable, but still fine. I've been in worse situations.

A few weeks ago our entire heating system broke - boiler and water heater. We went two weeks without heat or hot water before the replacements could be put in. I put the $11,000 cost on my credit card until I could decide what to do.

The end of the month is fast approaching. Here are the details:
- The house is in my name only. Live-in BF has offered to help, but I feel the majority of the responsibility is mine, even if we are headed toward marriage. Plus, he makes less than me and has way less savings.
- I have $13,000 in my savings account.
- I looked into a loan, but despite my 800ish credit score, the interest rates offered were almost as high as the credit card.

Do I pay it all off and leave $2000 in my savings?
Do I pay half of it and throw as much extra as I can at the card each month instead of adding to my savings?
Do I keep my savings and just pay the card each month with everything I would have put into savings? I can maybe put $1500 in per month if I'm super careful with money and nothing else goes wrong.

*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose Friday, notching a gain during the holiday-shortened trading week.
*****
&gt; The Dow rose 152.97 points, or 0.45% to 34,347.03, marking the third consecutive session of gains. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.03% to end the day at 4,026.12. The Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.52% to 11,226.36, weighed down by shares of Activision Blizzard, which fell 4% on news that the FTC could block Microsoft from taking over the gaming company.
*****
&gt; All three indexes ended the week higher. The Dow is up 1.78%, and the S&amp;P 500 is up 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq is lagging the other two indexes but is still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
&gt; Stocks were muted at the start of the week as traders waited for minutes from the Federal Reserve’s November meeting. The minutes showed that the central bank anticipates slowing the pace of interest rate hikes going forward, which gave stocks a boost into the end of the week even amid choppy sessions due to low trading volumes.
*****
&gt; “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
&gt; A slew of solid retail earnings reports signaling some consumer strength even amid worries of economic weakness also lifted stocks.
*****
&gt; Worries about continued lockdowns in China kept markets in check. The country is ramping up Covid restrictions after seeing climbing case counts in recent days. Earlier in the week, China reported its first Covid deaths since May.
*****
&gt; Next week, investors will be watching for more earnings reports from companies such as Kroger and Ulta Beauty on deck. On the economic front, traders will be watching further comments from Fed officials, as well as the release of the personal consumption expenditure report on Thursday — the central bank’s preferred inflation indicator. The November jobs print is due Friday.

&gt; # Tempered Yearend Gains When S&amp;P Down YTD Thanksgiving

&gt; Last year at this time on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving S&amp;P 500 was up 24.9% year-to-date. November 2021 gave back a fractional loss, but December and the Santa Claus Rally delivered solid gains.

&gt; But then the stuff hit the fan. Inflation became non-transitory, the Fed began tapering asset purchases and telegraphing imminent rate hikes, Russia invaded Ukraine and the bear came out of hibernation.

&gt; This year on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving the market is in an entirely different situation with S&amp;P down -16.0% YTD. The table here shows how the market claws its way back in most years with fewer but sizable losses bringing the averages down.

&gt; The fact that November 2022 is up so far is supportive for continued upside. What stands out to us in this table is the rather solid performance for the Tuesday before Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally trade as well as solid gains for the Santa Claus Rally itself.

&gt; We wish everyone a happy and festive Thanksgiving and hope that you all enjoy the time with friends and family!

&gt; # Continuing Claims Flash Recessionary Warning

&gt; Due to tomorrow's holiday, this week's jobless claims data was released a day early and were not exactly a release to be thankful for. The latest readings were bad all around with both initial and continuing claims rising more than expected. For initial claims, last week's level was revised up by 1K to 222K, and this week's reading rose by 18K to 240K. That is the highest level of claims since the week of August 18th, and the sequential increase was the largest since the end of September. Whereas recent readings on jobless claims have been healthy in the sense that they have remained within the range of low readings from the few years prior to the pandemic, this new high would have been at the high end of the 2008 to 2019 pre-pandemic range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims.png))**

&gt; On a non-seasonally adjusted basis, the current week of the year typically sees claims move higher with a week-over-week increase 82% of the time. However, this week's increase was around 10K larger than what the comparable week of the year has historically averaged. In other words, from a seasonal perspective, the rise in claims is perfectly normal in terms of direction but less so in terms of size. Now at 248K, claims are in line with levels for the comparable weeks in 2021 and 2019.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Claims-NSA.png))**

&gt; Continuing claims continue to be the more interesting story around jobless claims. Delayed one week to the initial claims number, continuing claims as of the week of November 11th rose for a sixth week in a row. As we noted last week, such a streak of consistent increases in continuing claims has been rare, especially in the years following the Global Financial Crisis. In fact, the rise during the onset of the pandemic in 2020—which lasted for 10 consecutive weeks—was the only other notably lengthy streak post-2009. Prior to that, there have only been a handful of other times in which continuing claims have risen for 10 weeks or more.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims-Streak.png))**

&gt; As for the current rise in claims, the latest increase leaves the reading at 1.551 million which is the highest level since the first week of March. From a historical perspective, though, that remains an impressively low reading and well below the pre-pandemic range even if it is rapidly deteriorating.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112322-Con-Claims.png))**

&gt; As for just how bad of a stretch it has been for continuing claims, the 187K increase, or 13.7% jump, during the past six weeks would be by far the largest in over a decade outside of the start of the pandemic. Additionally, such a large increase in the span of six weeks is consistent with increases from all prior recessions. In fact, as claims have made their way off of historic lows, the current increase is nearly the same size as the early 1990s recession and is even larger than those in the early 1980s and early 2000s.

&gt; # Speculators Smelting Shorts

&gt; As we do each Monday, in last night's Closer we recapped the latest Commitments of Traders data from the CFTC. This data set provides a look at how speculators have positioned themselves (long or short) in various futures. We show those readings as a net percentage of open interest. In other words, higher positive values indicate a much larger share of open interest is positioned long and vice versa for negative readings.

&gt; In the commodities space, after longs backed out in a big way earlier this year, readings have risen rapidly in gold, silver, copper, and palladium futures. As for how sharp of turnarounds they have been, the increase over the past two weeks rank in the top decile of all periods in data going back to the mid 1980s for each of the previously mentioned metals.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/11/112222-COT-1.png))**

&gt; For the most widely followed of these metals (gold, silver, and copper), this is only the 14th time on record each of their two week changes ranked in the 90th percentile or above in the same week without another occurrence in the prior three months. The most recent occurrence of such a large broad increase in major metals positioning was in July of 2014.

&gt; Although these readings indicate that speculators are increasingly placing long bets on these futures, such data actually can be a bit of a messy indicator for forward performance. Although these readings indicate bullish sentiment, forward performance is the opposite in the near term with dramatic underperformance relative to the norm one week later (which we have seen play out so far). One month and three month performance tends to see further declines in these commodities as well which is not exactly unheard of for precious metals while it is dramatically weaker for the industrial metals. Six month performance is generally more in line with historical norms while the bullishness in positioning only seems to come through to price action one year out. One year average returns for gold, silver, and copper are much stronger than the norm, although positivity rates are still just barely above 50/50. (Past performance is no guarantee of future results.).

&gt; # The “Most Obvious” Bear Market Rally Ever?


&gt; “ The stock market is never obvious. It is designed to fool most of the people, most of the time.” Jesse Livermore

&gt; I’ve noticed a trend the past few weeks and that is since the mid-October lows most commentators say we are obviously experiencing a bear market rally in stocks. But is it really so obvious? Remember, as one of the greatest traders ever said, the market’s job is to fool the masses most of the time. Wouldn’t it be something if this was actually the start of a new bullish phase and not just another bear market bounce?

&gt; # What’s a Bear Market?
First things first, what is a bear market rally? To me, it is when stocks bounce (potentially significantly), only to eventually move back to new lows. Think about the 17% rally the S&amp;P 500 saw over the summer, only to roll back over and make new lows in October. That’s a bear market rally, which is what most think is happening now.

&gt; # Calling This a Bear Market Rally Is Popular
Here’s the catch, most stocks actually bottomed back in June. That’s right, more 52-week lows took place in June than in October, so you could say we’ve been in a new bull market for five full months now. Not a popular take I’m aware, but one that could be happening. Not to mention small caps didn’t break their June lows back in October. Remember, there are a lot more small caps than there are large caps, again suggesting the real lows took place in June, not October.

&gt; Here’s a very quick Google search of ‘bear market rally’ and you can get a taste for what I mean about most thinking this is nothing more than a bear market rally.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE #1!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-156.png))**

&gt; I do a lot of social media, specifically Twitter, and I must say that the amount of anger when stocks go higher is about as high as I can ever remember. Bullish tweets or stats are simply crushed by an angry mob. Given this is a family website, I can’t share some of the comments, but let’s just say being remotely bullish is frowned upon by most investors and traders right now. Again, this is likely because some people believe it is so ‘obvious’ to everyone this is only a bear market rally, and new lows are a near certain but maybe it isn’t so obvious.

&gt; # More Signs the Crowd Isn’t In a Good Mood
The great Stoic philosopher, Seneca the Younger said, “We suffer more often in imagination than in reality.” One might interpret that as we all worry too much and things really aren’t as bad as they seem. And this could be what is happening right now. We keep hearing how bad the economy is, yet as Sonu noted last week, the consumer is quite strong. In fact, the fourth quarter is expected to see GDP growth of more than 3% according to the Atlanta Fed. Speaking of Seneca the Younger, do you know who his father was? Seneca the Elder. I’m serious, that was his name. Gotta love Ancient Rome and its philosophers!

&gt; Enough Ancient Roman jokes and back to why this likely isn’t just a bear market rally, and why it could be the start to a new bullish move higher. One of my favorite surveys is the Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey. This monthly survey asks real money managers what they expect and how they are positioned. The recent report showed cash was up 6.2% of a portfolio, near the highest level since 2001, while a net 77% of respondents expected a global recession within 12 months.

&gt; But my favorite stat was “0% were looking for a ‘goldilocks’ scenario.” Take note, this scenario would mean above-trend growth and below-trend inflation (See BofA Global Fund Manager Survey chart below). I agree it would be quite hard to expect that right here and now, but my takeaway is nearly no one is expecting good things to happen. Meaning expectations are historically low. As the chart below shows (focus on the yellow line), the last time it was this low was in late 2011, when all we heard about was the fiscal cliff drama out of Washington. Looking back, 2012, 2013, and 2014 were very solid years for both the economy and great years for the stock market. Given expectations got so low back then, good news then sparked a much better stock market and we think a similar situation could be in play again as we head into 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/blog-346-800x466.png))**

&gt; George Orwell said, “To see what is in front of one’s nose is a constant struggle.” That is what is happening now, in my opinion. Things are getting better, yet people are focusing on the past and for some reason, angry about good news. My take is don’t be angry and embrace what could be better times and better news coming.

&gt; I hope everyone has a great Thanksgiving week and you all enjoy eating way too much food with family and friends!

&gt; # Time to Feast Thanksgiving-Santa Claus Rally Trade

&gt; Market action this past week and today has set up this annual market feast. Stocks have consolidated October’s big gains in typical early-November fashion setting the market up for the perennial yearend rally.

&gt; Since 1950 S&amp;P 500 is up 80% of the time from the Tuesday before Thanksgiving to the 2nd trading day of the year, average gain 2.7%. Russell 2000 is up 79% of the time since 1979, average gain 3.4%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/296d2cdf14bf31f7acd66709ed72f8b6/4b3944852faa5d0b-54/s500x750/245e708ac6a7b175a622927710ec92d2460f8b0e.jpg))**

&gt; Thanksgiving kicks off a run of solid bullish seasonal patterns. November-January is the year’s best consecutive 3-month span (2023 STA p 149) and as we have been discussing all year we are at the outset of the “Sweet Spot” of the 4-Year Cycle (2023 STA p 34). Then there’s the January Effect (2023 STA pgs 112 &amp; 114) of small caps outperforming large caps in January, which nowadays begins in mid-December.

&gt; And of course, the “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac and often misunderstood, is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. Pop also coined the phrase: “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; So, we have combined these seasonal occurrences into one trade: Buy the Tuesday before Thanksgiving and hold until the 2nd trading day of the New Year. Our good friend and renowned technician and options guru Larry McMillan of the Options Strategist opened our eyes to this trade and runs it with options on iShares Russell 2000 (IWM) starting on the day before Thanksgiving.

Bitcoin,Will we ever be able to safely get interest on our Bitcoin?,"I was never convinced by all the companies offering high interest on BTC and other cryptos. High interest rates mean high risk. Though to be honest, I had never heard of FTX and its founder before this month. But will there ever be a time when I can safely park my BTC somewhere, and get bank rates, without losing sleep? Like getting CDs and T-bills with Fiat? Perhaps in the future there will be some decentralized contract, which gets me the interest but also gives me total protection? One should be able to get a few percentage points of interest with zero risk. Or can this only happen if and when BTC becomes the reserve currency?",cryptocurrency,1669407804

personalfinance,Help regarding i bonds,"Hello, everyone (again hahaha)! I recently submitted a post regarding the Roth IRA and index funds (huge huge shout out to all of those that commented on my thread and helped me out with allocation and figuring out the ins and outs of the Roth IRA and fidelity) and was finally able to set it up for now and for future use.

Recently, I also opened a savings account to hold emergency funds.

I’m 28 and starting (in my opinion) very late with all of these emergency/investment/retirement plans so I thought I’d do everything right now after recently getting very stable employment.  

That being said, I’m now looking into i-bonds, what they are, and how they make the best use of them.

I’ve done much research over the past week for i-bonds as much as I did for the Roth IRA and these are the conclusions I’ve arrived to:

- they function a bit similarly to a savings accounts, but are much better in terms of returns and are more for investing rather than emergency-using

- The interest rate fluctuates and is currently set at around 6.8% total (recently was around 9% some time October until early November I believe)

- It’s generally a better idea to leave the funds for at least 5 heats to prevent any type of penalties (a 3 month I l believe I read about)

- the limit to move funds in is $10k per year, which resets on January 1st

- it’s relatively safe and stable in terms of not losing anything in the long run

- any gains must be reported to be taxed

- any funds put into i-bonds will use set interest rates for 6 months and then go back down it the current interest rate

All that being said, I have a few questions regarding I-bonds that i am a bit in a loss over

1. Is there an app that helps manage US treasury i bonds?

2. I missed out on the 9% interest; at this point, if I put in money for the 6.8%, IF it rises up again to say 9%, can I put in money in again while the 9% is in place so my gains are at that 9% interest rate?

3. There is something else called a treasury bill I think? I haven’t looked into it yet but is there a tl; dr version perhaps? I’m a bit worn out right l now haha, totally understand if I’m called out on being lazy.

4. Should focus on maximizing the Roth IRA or the US treasury i bonds first? Im aware $6k is the limit for the Roth IRA and $10k for us treasury i bonds with different deadlines for each but which should be prioritized more?

Thank you in advance for any help or comments! I am very grateful for this sub; a lot of the info I said here is based off on this subreddit and google. If there is any information I made an error on, please do correct me.

Any answers regarding the aforementioned questions would be sincerely appreciated!

personalfinance,Buy house all cash? Cash out refi to invest in stocks?,"First, let me start by just saying this is for discussion purposes.  So hear me out before you just answer with a ""no"".  Also, assume this is when interest rates are stable and neither too high nor too low.  I guess we can use 5-6% since that is historically a comfortable rate I think many can't argue too much with.

Whenever someone asks ""Should I cash out the equity in my house to invest in stocks"" the answer is a very scolding ""No!""  Security of paid off house, blah, blah.  

On the other hand if someone took 90% of their life savings and bought a house all cash (leaving 10% for repairs and emergencies and what not"", that would be also ""Stupid"".  Leverage, historical investment returns 7% &gt; appreciation \~5%, blah, blah.

So say you have $500k (after taxes on any gains, of course, and say this is in your non-retirement accounts, where the size of your retirement accounts are just OK, call it 80% of ideal for your age), and a house you want to buy is $450k.  Let's say it's a couple of weeks ago, and borrowing rates were &gt;7%.  And you think, well, that sucks (imagine how much that would suck if rates were 14%+ like in the 70's).  Do you just buy the house outright with $450k?  But then you have pretty much no money left invested to grow.  But you have all this equity in the house.  So say rates drop to 4-5%.  Do you cash out some of that and invest in stocks?  

Is there really any difference between 

* Paying all cash initially and then cashing out to invest in stocks 
* Leaving most cash in stocks and taking on debt

The end result is sort of the same, just different steps to get there as well as the psychological ""bird in the hand"" of a fully-paid house and then subsequently going into debt.  Let's ignore taxes for this discussion (say mortgage interest deduction doesn't provide much benefit over standard deduction).

(I know there's probably a timing aspect to consider because if rates were 7%+ today, they probably aren't dropping to 4% next month.  Tho, what if they did?)

Neither extreme (all-cash 0% financed vs no-down 100% financed) is ideal.  But where is the line?  Is it a line that changes as you age?  Does it change based on interest rates?  Does it change when the $ is higher and mortgage interest deduction comes back into play?",finance,1669415613

I prefer the ease of trading it in to a dealership than having to deal with selling it privately then buying separately afterwards. 

The used car market is still high currently so if I trade now I would be buying at a high price but also my trade in would be valued higher. If I trade later in maybe half a year when the used car market drops a bit I would be buying the truck for cheaper but also my trade in would be valued at less too.

I have made budgets time and time again and have yet to find a way to build it so I can simply follow that plan.

The only thing I have found that works even a little is working 7 days a week so that I'm too tired to go out and spend money on things that I don't need. It has been working well so far but I would ideally like to find a way to work myself out of this situation without having to do this for years on end in order to get it done. I am not looking for someone to build a way out for me, I just need help finding the proper tools to use in my situation in order to get the job done. TIA",finance,1669440354

stocks,"Hedge fund Rokos warns that sterling is ‘vulnerable’ to further falls Brexit, deglobalisation and pandemic deal bigger shock to terms of tra","Sterling looks “vulnerable” to further falls and the looming recession could have “serious” effects on British society, according to the hedge fund firm of billionaire trader Chris Rokos.

Rokos Capital Management, which manages around $14.5bn in assets, told its investors that the UK had suffered a bigger shock to its terms of trade than other developed countries because of the impact of Brexit, deglobalisation and the coronavirus pandemic.

Such a deterioration, which puts pressure on an already yawning current account deficit and can [fuel inflation](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/8981df2f-f723-4a1a-8044-0e7a3e4856a0), made it harder for policymakers to control consumer price growth, the firm wrote in a letter seen by the Financial Times.

“The recession that is required to tame inflation in the UK is deeper than that needed elsewhere, with potentially serious societal implications,” it said. “Sterling looks vulnerable.”

Rokos declined to comment further.

The gloomy diagnosis comes after a number of high-profile fund managers targeted the UK market. Odey Asset Management founder [Crispin Odey was among traders who profited from a plunge in sterling](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/d54b4915-60a2-4f73-b1b9-6ea4b7523dd9) in September following former chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng’s “mini” Budget of unfunded tax cuts.

Rokos, one of the world’s biggest macro hedge funds, [profited during the UK’s gilt market crisis](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/e1960ff6-392f-4a09-94f2-bc60e2272ac6) in September, thanks to bets that UK borrowing costs would have to rise.

Sterling has [fallen more than 10 per cent](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://markets.ft.com/data/currencies/tearsheet/summary?s=gbpusd) against the dollar this year and dropped to an all-time low of $1.035 in the wake of Kwarteng’s financial statement. Since then it has recovered strongly to around $1.21, its highest level since August.

Compounding the problem for Britain is the “disproportionately negative” hit that mortgage owners would take from higher interest rates, because fixed-rate home loans in the UK tend to expire more quickly than in other nations, such as the US. That, Rokos wrote, could mean that the Bank of England raises interest rates “too slowly to contain inflation”.

Rokos’s warning comes after highly bearish predictions from a number of other big-name managers. [Paul Singer’s Elliott recently warned](https://archive.is/o/OxtTs/https://www.ft.com/content/f3bb0f96-1816-4481-8318-4f7583326a4a) that the world was on the road to “hyperinflation” and could be heading towards its worst crisis since the second world war, while Saba Capital founder Boaz Weinstein has said global stocks could enter a Japan-style bear market lasting decades.

Rokos, a former co-founder of hedge fund firm Brevan Howard, has gained around 44 per cent in his fund so far this year. That puts him on track for his best year of performance since launch in 2015 and makes back large losses he suffered last year after being caught out by a sharp move in short-dated bonds.

His gains this year come during a fruitful period for macro hedge funds, many of which have been able to profit from a huge rise in government bond yields globally, as central banks raise interest rates to try to combat high inflation.

Rokos said that to be more optimistic on the UK’s outlook it would have to see “signs of a quietly engineered softer Brexit”, or higher immigration.

It also warned that, with a recession a “necessity” in order to tame inflation and cash becoming a viable alternative investment to financial assets, global stock markets look “exposed” to further falls.

Given there were “essentially fewer resources available and more investment is required, prospective returns need to be higher”, it wrote. This means that “asset prices need to be lower”.

CryptoCurrency,Bank of America Criticizes Proof of Reserves While Banks Need No Reserves. Anybody Smell Fear?,"BoA put of a statement criticizing proof of reserves saying it has many shortcomings. I'm not even saying PoR is perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better than nothing, and we also are pushing toward proof of liabilities which Kraken, Gate io and Coinbase have already published proof of reserves with liabilities.

This is meanwhile funds is the bank require absolutely NO reserves. I'm not kidding.

So basically, (American) banks can print infinite amounts of money with no repercussions, with other countries only partially limited to their lending by their own reserve ratios. As a matter of fact, since COVID, authorities have been actively encouraging bank lending particularly in the US. They cooled their statements on that now that we see the effects on inflation and how terrible easy money was. Imagine if there was doubt in the market and a run of any of these banks. It would be 2008 all over again and probably worse.

I understand the statement by BoA to be out of fear. If CEXes can prove through math and not any weak flimsy word-of-mouth promises that all funds are backed and there is no debt through higher amounts of liability what would stop people from using crypto, besides only being able to understand it. All the financial freedom with limited responsibility as they could mostly trust CEXes to handle all the security and ease-of-use features.

All that would be left is to fix Defi hacks. But trustless but trustworthy(through math) Cefi would more than fill in until then and it sounds like a nightmare for banks. Crypto is growing and banks are feeling the pinch.

EDIT: I am speaking for American banks. Some have argued out that banks don't print money like tokens. First of all, I never equated printed crypto tokens to printed bank fiat money. I was not comparing insurance. I only spoke about the topic of reserves. And banks do effectively 'print' money at the behest of the Central Bank(Federal Reserve) based on the reserve ratio which is currently 0. Further, .you cannot accept that Central Banks print money  without accepting that commercial banks also again print money because the money that Central Banks print only reaches into the private sector economy *through* commercial banks based on  choosing. In essence, commercial banks are part of the whole Central Bank(Federal Reserve) system of printing money. Printed money only gets into individual and business' hands *though* Central Banks the process of which banks almost completely control. This also partially depends on if you view 'printed money' as money created from a fractional reserve system which I'd very such agree that money coming from basically thin air is printed money.",cryptocurrency,1669472315

personalfinance,Parents are obtaining a windfall of 78k. Best way to use?,"Backstory: 
My father (65y/o) had his pension cut due to mismanagement in 2008. Due to some law passages under the Biden administration, he will be obtaining approximately 78k (after federal taxes are taken out) in March in backpay, and will obtain approximately 1,500 additional each month from January 2023 on, essentially reinstating his full pension amount. He lives with my mother, who is 63, in NY. NYS taxes aren’t taken out of the backpay amount.

Income:
- Father makes 60k a year at his current job, 2,700 takehome a month. He plans to retire once my mother qualifies for Medicare.
- Uncut portion of pension is 3,515
- Total current income per month prior to any increases in wage 6,215


Debts/ expenses:
- My mom has a meticulous budget, and after all expenses are paid, they are left with $1,250
- 6k owed on a higher APR credit card (they plan to pay this off immediately when the money is received)
- Mortgage: Has approx 130k left on it, about $1,200 a month
- The rest of the monthly expenses are groceries/ car/ insurance. 

Question: 
My father is looking to retire in the next few years once my mom turns 65 for Medicare.

He made around $68k, had good benefits, and had an 825. However, once COVID hit, he couldn't find another job and hasn't had another job since then. Earlier this year, he ran out of his retirement and had to go to rehab due to alcoholism which he has been battling for the longest time. Currently, he has no income, and my mother is covering his bills (e.g., car insurance). My parents divorced in 2010, but we live in the same household.

However, my parents are not even close enough for me to get approved for private student loans to cover the rest of my tuition (after fed loans).

Markets remain neutral to bearish bias on higher timeframes.  In previous bear markets it took Bitcoin around 11 months (330 days) to find a floor, once RSI bottomed. 

We are around 270 days currently. 330 days will land in January '23, but given the macro I would expect a longer bear market than in the past.

That said, we are starting to see early signs of investors trying to front-run a soft pivot by the US Fed, with equities and other markets rallying in recent weeks. If this continues, once crypto shakes the FTX fallout, we should follow as well.

Regarding the bearish to neutral bias I stated up front- note that this refers to the monthly chart and higher timeframes. On lower timeframes, say weekly.. we probably have a shot at one more swing low (maybe) then a -potential- midrange rally into the year end and Q1.  

This largely depends on the upcoming FOMC and ECB actions into the years end, along with the usual external factors like inflation, oil and Russia.",cryptocurrency,1669504715

I got addicted and started grinding from Jan 2021. my friends they went to another countries for higher stuides. here i was addicted to valorant. when i pickup skins in game, i felt my aim was getting better with skins then started purchasing skins. my first skin is elderflame vandal. after few days this skin is so bad and effecting my aim. then reaver came into my shop. i bought that. and i bought almost 11 skins including all the main guns. I was hardstuck silver due to smurfs. then came to know about aimlab and kovaaks. aimlab did not improve my aim that much. purchased kovaaks and saw slight  improvement. after months of grinding came to gold lobby. i spent like 400$ on skins. 

Main problem is when i switch to single player game, i find it boring in few mins no matter how good the game is, my brain just not grasping it. immediately switched to valorant. not only my time but my interest in singleplayer games was also lost.

Happy  is i lost interest in valorant too because the agent trailers will be awesome but when used their abilities in game they are trash and simple. in mid 2022 i lost interest in valorant. sad thing is i fuckking lost interest in games too. i am unable to enjoy any fucking game. valorant just destroyed everything.

from july i didnot play valorant and i am happy for that. recently an agent called cypher got buffed and i did not open the game and so proud  of that.i dedicated totally myself to work and watching few netflix series but still cant getting into any game.

stocks,Using the yield curves inversion as a tool for gauging recession risk is currently flawed,"I just seen a post hit the page about how the yield curve is the most inverted it's ever been, and how we're in for an extremely bad recession. The truth is I don't know, but one thing I do know is that using the yield curve to back up this opinion is extremely flawed.

The reason why the yield curve is so inverted right now is because markets predict that inflation will be fought off by these increased rates. The belief seems to be that the speed of incline will be matched with a similar decline. Where this decline begins is what the market has been trying to estimate over the past 6 months, and it's been wrong each time.

That being noted, anyone expecting the yield curve to be anything other than inverted isn't really looking at what we know. We've seen that current rates have caused the CPI to fall 0.2% below expectations, quite a huge blow for future rate hikes. This means that current rates have finally helped to contain inflation. The next question will be whether we've gone too far.

When the next CPI results are released, they will dictate the shape of the curve. If we see an extremely low CPI result, we are most likely going to see an even more inverted curve, as expectations will grow on the Fed to maintain/lower current rates, meaning that long term bonds will face lower rates in the future. 

On the other hand, if the CPI numbers pick up, we'll see the yield curve more likely than not pull back, although we probably won't see it un-invert, simply due to the fact that there's a common belief that now might be the best time to invest in bonds. And where that belief exists, there's the belief that rates will not stay this high for long, otherwise why not wait another month?

We've already entered a technical recession, but personally, I don't see it being all that bad. Unemployment is still very low, inflation seems to be taming. To me, it looks like we may just end up having a few years of low growth.",finance,1669511668

algorand,CDBC and Algorand,"Firstly, I am heavily invested in Algorand, and I have very mixed feelings about how Algorand may be at the forefront of being involved at the development of Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC).

The negative aspects of CBDCs include the loss of privacy due to traceability, an open goal for negative interest rates, programmable money, and customisable monetary policy by individuals.

If Algorand really works with governments on developing CBDC, it's from an ethical point of view rather disappointing but from a price perspective, it could skyrocket. 

On the other hand, if Algorand doesn't do it, someone else does, so why wouldn't I support the development of CBDC.

CryptoCurrency,Coinbase stock,"Hi, first post here!

I'd like to share my views on Coinbase stock, as at this moment there are some key factors I consider relevant taking into consideration, which are:

1. Obvious one: crypto markets are in a bear stage, and have historically behaved as cyclical markets, so odds are quite storng on a bull market during 2023 / 2024. Ofc, this doesn't mean that it will recover its 60k + all time max, but I believe it is quite reasonable to see a growth in btc market cap and price.
2. BTC, the biggest crypto in the market, will be halved probably during 1st half of 2023. Maybe my analysis is quite simplistic, but I would bet that is a factor to consider. On its own maybe its not to make BTC rise.
3. Markets expect a FED pivot in interest rates, maybe in 50 basis points. There is a strong consensus that high interest rates are translated into stock and crypto price decrease. A FED pivot would also be a factor that could make BTC rise.
4. If BTC rises, and so its market cap, it will probably mean the crypto market will also follow that tendency. That would extremely benefit COIN balance sheet and cashflow.
5. FTX, on of the biggest competitors, is down. The scandal around it is now scaring away people from crypto markets even more, making everything that has ""crypto"" on its name toxic to investors. Prices, as a natural consequence, are going down. COIN rumors over FTX crash contagion have been dissipated as the company stated it only had 15$ million of deposits with FTX.
6. Given the probable chance that crypto markets could experience a bull phase during the next year, the two main options new traders will have are BNB (biggest and most popular one, lower fees) and COIN (which is more welcoming to new investors). The focus COIN has over attracting new investors with a simple, intuitiv eapp, could be a good advantage towards its main competitor in a stage when market is receiving loads of newcomers. Plus, COIN doesn't seem to have as many legal/regulatory problems as Binance does.
7. COIN profits as a result of its share in USDC, which went up more than a 360% since last year, and will probably continue to grow (can't tell if in the same proportion, but USDC is currently one of the leading ones in the e money market).
8. COIN has 5,006,584 $ only in cash. It's 50% share on Centre Consortium (USDC) hasn't provided an exact data about its financials, but it could aslo have a big amount of it. Compared to its current 10,000,000 market cap, knowing for sure they have 5,000,0000 in cash and God knows what from USDC, that by itself seems a good reason to invest in COIN.

As of writing this post WTI Crude sits at 76.28$. Excluding 2022, this is still the highest crude oil price we've had since 2014. 

Now add to this that USA is depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Europe is in a recession and China is still imposing lockdowns. All these factors belong to a BEAR thesis on oil as there is less demand for oil because of them.

Now I think it's not too exaggerated to expect that sooner rather than later that:

\- USA stops using the Oil Reserves as it will become a national security concern if it gets too low

\- Europe will see brighter days

\- China relaxes covid protocols(especially with the recent protests)

This should mean that whenever these things happen oil demand will be higher-&gt;higher oil prices(starting from already high prices)-&gt;higher inflation.

**2022 S&amp;P 500 Predictions**

Every year, Wall Streets’s top strategist make a call of where they think the S&amp;P 500 will finish. We wanted to share a summary of some of these target prices for 2022 and the strategist reasoning for it. Remember to take these predictions with a grain of salt as markets are hardly predictable no matter how much of an “expert” you are.

**Morgan Stanley**

**Target Price-4,400**

**2022 performance: -7.7%**

While the firm still expects solid EPS growth next year, “uncertainty around that expectation goes up materially given cost pressures, supply issues, along with tax and policy uncertainty that is unique to the U.S.,” the analysts wrote in the note. With the rest of the world having lagged the U.S. recovery, the firm sees more “catch up” potential elsewhere and less earnings volatility over the next 12 months.

While Morgan Stanley does expect earnings for the S&amp;P 500 overall to be solid, chief U.S. equity strategist Michael Wilson expects “significant” earnings dispersion at the stock level, making the year more about stocks than sectors or styles.

**Wells Fargo**

**Target Price-5,200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

Persistent supply shortages and inflation pressures lead us to adjust the magnitudes of some 2022 targets, but we believe the global economy should still mark an above-average pace next year. More importantly, our tactical preferences for the next 6 to 18 months are nearly all unchanged.

**Goldman Sachs**

**Target price-5,100**

**2022 Performance: 7%**

“Decelerating economic growth, a tightening Fed, and rising real yields suggest investors should expect modestly below-average returns next year.”

“In contrast with our expectation during the past year, corporate tax rates will likely remain unchanged in 2022 and rise in 2023. Corporate earnings will grow and lift share prices. The equity bull market will continue.”

“While we remain vigilant on margins, we don’t think it makes sense to assume the worst on this front given the strong track record that companies have had managing through cost pressures even before the pandemic.”

**Credit Suisse**

**Target Price-5200**

**2022 Performance: 9.1%**

“This constructive outlook is based on robust projections for economic growth in both real and nominal terms, further margin upside in cyclical groups, a pickup in buybacks and a favorable discount rate despite Fed tightening.”

**JP Morgan**

**Target Price-5,050**

**2022 Performance: 5.7%**

A JPM team led by Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, chief U.S. equity strategist, sees further stock upside ahead, albeit more moderate, on better-than-expected earnings growth, easing supply shocks, improved background on China (which JPM upgraded to overweight on expectations for policy easing and as equity risk premiums from regulatory moves are priced in) and emerging markets, normalizing consumer spending habits and, most important, accommodative central banks.

**BMO Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5,300**

**2022 Performance: 10.97%**

The bank believes that investors are too focused on inflation, which should moderate as supply chain kinks get straightened out next year. Combined with solid corporate earnings, that should continue to drive stocks higher in 2022, BMO analysts said. What’s more, the size of the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet “will remain very large for quite some time, which should continue to be supportive of stocks.”

**RBC Capital Markets**

**Target Price-5050**

**2022 performance: 5.7%**

Like JPMorgan, the firm sees a slight gain for stocks in 2022, with heightened concern over rising Covid cases yet to derail the bull market. The new omicron variant is a reason for investors to “proceed with caution but not to panic,” RBC analysts said in a recent note. The firm did admit that there is likely to be more stock market volatility in the near term, especially as omicron could worsen ongoing supply chain issues.

**UBS**

**Target Price-4850**

**2022 Performance: 1.7%**

While stocks are “likely to have a pullback at some point,” strong corporate earnings and an eventual decline in Covid cases should help boost the market higher, the firm said.

**Bank of America**

**Target Price-4600**

**2022 Performance: -3.48%**",finance,1669560142

investing,You can't predict. You can prepare.,"Hey investing team,

I have been interested in the topic of how to make decisions (including financial decisions) in an uncertain environment.

I learned that to thrive in an uncertain world, we shouldn’t rely on making predictions; rather we should cultivate anti-fragility. Anti-fragility allows us to benefit from the stressful and unpredictable events life has in store.

I am sharing what I learned today with you all hoping to get feedback, your perspectives and share what I learned. By the end of this essay, you will understand

* Why predictions are useless;
* What anti-fragility is;
* Why anti-fragility removes the need to make predictions; and
* Most importantly, principles for becoming anti-fragile so you can benefit from uncertainty.

Let me know what you think!

## The Absurdity of Certainty

&gt;*There are two kinds of forecasters: those who don’t know, and those who don’t know they don’t know. – John Kenneth Galbraith*

My disregard for predictions is because they are rarely helpful in making important decisions. This is for two reasons: 1) The only predictions that matter are outlier events (often called Black Swan events), and; 2) we don’t have a reliable process for predicting outlier events.

## Outliers lead to outperformance

The purpose of predictions is to make decisions about the future that result in outperformance.

You will be wealthier if you can predict the next stock market crash. You will be safer if you can predict the next natural disaster. You will have the best tee times if you can predict the weather.

Outperformance requires non-consensus perspectives. It is not useful to predict what we expect to occur. If everyone thinks it will rain tomorrow, the golf course will be empty. If you disagree and are right, you will have the course to yourself.

Said another way, what we want to predict is outlier events.

Outlier events are non-consensus because they are random and rare events with profound impacts. Wars, stock market crashes, pandemics, terrorism attacks (e.g., September 11th), natural disasters, and new technological inventions (e.g., the internet and the car) are all examples of rare events with profound impacts.

## Unreliable models

The issue is that predicting outlier events is impossible.

For a prediction to be reliable, there must be a process of converting inputs into outputs.

However, there isn’t a reliable process for turning all the variables associated with the future into an accurate prediction.

As an example, let’s look at one of the most common predictions: economic forecasts.

Think about all the inputs that surround this one prediction:

* What will the unemployment rate be?
* What will happen to commodity (e.g., oil) prices?
* Will geopolitical tensions lead to trade wars?
* What will the rate of innovation be?
* What will the central banks do? Will interest rates rise, fall, or stay constant?
* What will the rate of population growth be? What about immigration?
* What will the rate of productivity be?
* Which political party will be elected? What policies will they implement?

The point is that no one can balance all these factors to reach an accurate prediction of an outlier event. Doing so would require:

* Determining all the questions (inputs) that need to be answered, including inputs we haven’t yet considered (unknown unknowns)
* Coming up with answers to all the questions
* Considering the implications and interactions between all the inputs and how they influence each other
* Weighing the various inputs appropriately
* Synthesizing them into a non-consensus prediction

I can’t think of a more impossible task.

## The turkey problem

Imagine a turkey that is fed every day by a farmer.

Each passing day will increase the turkey’s confidence in the following statement: “Every day, I will be fed by a friendly farmer.”

However, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, the turkey’s confidence in that statement will change.

The turkey problem should clearly highlight the two points below:

* What matters to the turkey is not predicting another “normal” day but, rather, predicting outlier events (e.g., Thanksgiving).
* Using historical inputs and data to make a prediction doesn’t work for outlier events. They are outlier events because people never thought they could happen. Consider this: **The turkey’s confidence in its well-being was highest the day before Thanksgiving, when the risk was also the highest!** It is catastrophic to rely on the past to predict what the future has in store.

## Becoming the fire

&gt;*Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes a fire – Nassim Taleb*

You might point to rare instances in which people have predicted outlier events as evidence that it can be done. Michael Burry famously predicted the housing bubble in 2008 and a Hollywood movie was made about his prediction.

We can ignore this argument because it lacks reliability, a trait required for predictions. Michael Burry has made at least 10 other public stock market related predictions, all of them wrong, for a total record of 1/11. Even the smartest folks, like Mr. Burry, are not able to consistently predict outlier events. \[1\]

Regardless, it doesn’t matter whether you think that predictions are impossible or extremely difficult. There is a better way.

It is much easier to be anti-fragile than smart enough to predict the future.

## The triad

Everything in life is either fragile, robust, or anti-fragile.

Fragile things break when exposed to stressors. Robust things are resistant and absorb shocks. Anti-fragile things gain from stressors: They thrive and grow when exposed to outlier events.

Your glass cup falls from a kitchen table and, upon impact with the ground, breaks. Glass is fragile in this context.

You are Rollerblading in Central Park. Out of nowhere you hit a branch and crash. Your helmet hits the ground, protects your head, and doesn’t break. Your helmet is robust in this context. \[2\]

Your immune system is exposed to a new virus and, after a three-day battle, wins, becoming stronger in the process. Your immune system is anti-fragile in this context.

## Testing for positive asymmetry

What should be clear is a test for anti-fragility. Anything that has a positive asymmetry (more upside than downside from shocks or outlier events) is anti-fragile.

There are numerous examples of things that are anti-fragile at different scales.

* Working out makes your body stronger. When exposed to external shock (weightlifting, running, etc.) your body is forced to overcompensate and adapt to meet similar future shocks.
* Wildfires make forests stronger. When a wildfire occurs, it removes the accumulation of combustible material and creates room for new wildlife. \[3\]
* Airlines are anti-fragile at the system level (although fragile at the airplane level). Each airplane crash results in improvement to the overall system (the totality of all airplanes) because of the identification of mistakes and process improvements.

## Size matters

Before we run around seeking exposure to external shocks, it is important to realize that size matters.

The ability of a system, person, or thing to respond with anti-fragile characteristics to a stressor is dependent on the size of the stressor.

Small is better than large because harm is nonlinear. As the size of the shock increases, harm increases faster.

There is a difference between jumping 100 feet once and jumping one foot 100 times. One will kill you; the other will make your bones stronger.

Similarly, there is a difference between exposing your immune system to a small dose of virus (say, via vaccine) and exposing it to a much larger dose. Double the dose results in much more than double the effect.

It is also important that the impact of the shock or stressor not cause total loss. If you are exposed to a viral dose large enough to kill you, your immune system doesn’t have a chance to get stronger.

## Anti-fragility &gt; Prediction

Anti-fragility occurs when systems, or things, have more upside than downside from shocks. When you have anti-fragile characteristics, you don’t need to predict when shocks will occur. You can sleep comfortably knowing that when they do occur, you will benefit.

## Becoming anti-fragile

Let us recap what we know:

* What matters are outlier events
* Predicting outlier events is impossible
* Anti-fragility removes the need for predictions by putting us in a position to benefit from outlier events

The question, then, is how does one become anti-fragile?

Anti-fragility can be achieved with different tactics at different scales.

While I am still learning and updating my thinking, below is a list of some of the principles I have found useful in becoming anti-fragile, along with vignettes to help illustrate the points.

## Principle #1: Redundancy

Anti-fragility is achieved through redundancy. Having extra capacity is a way to benefit from shocks. The difficulty is that redundancy seems wasteful if nothing unusual happens. The key is to be disciplined enough to build redundancy when you don’t need it for when you inevitably do.

*Redundancy and money:* Let me illustrate with a financial example. Having a sizable amount of your wealth in cash (say 10%) will make you anti-fragile. You will miss some short-term gain by not investing this money; however, when shocks or stressors eventually occur, you can be opportunistic, aggressive and have significant upside (e.g., buying assets at a big discount).

Redundancy removes the need for you to predict which outlier event will cause difficulties. External shocks cause value to flow towards a set of basic items. For example, in all of the following scenarios cash increases in value: war, market crashes, revolution, losing your job, pandemic, natural disaster, getting sick, etc. \[4\]

*Redundancy and time:* The same idea applies to time. Having the extra capacity to pursue interests, let your mind wander and explore opportunities that arise has more upside than scheduling every second of your time.

*Redundancy and other systems*: The redundancy principle applies to the system level as well. Hospitals, power grids, supply chains, traffic infrastructure, etc. are all systems that would benefit from having redundancy built in. Airplanes have incredible safety records due to the level of redundancy built in (e.g., they can fly their entire route on one engine and carry at least two hours of extra jet fuel). This principle should be extended to many other aspects of our lives.

Redundancy is often compared to having insurance. However, this comparison is not quite accurate. Insurance limits your downside but doesn’t provide upside (insurance is robust). Redundancy does.

## Principle #2: Optionality

Having options leads to anti-fragility by allowing you to pivot to the most favorable outcome in an uncertain future.

*New York rent:* I live in New York, where rent is atrociously high. Had I been smarter, I would have moved into a rent-controlled apartment. Doing so would make me anti-fragile through optionality.

In a rent-controlled apartment, I have the option to stay for as long as I wish, but no obligation to do so. If I want to move, I easily can. Should rents increase dramatically, I am largely protected. However, should rents collapse, I can easily switch apartments and reduce my monthly expense.

Having this option creates asymmetry. I benefit from lower rents but am not impacted by higher rents. By having options, I don’t need to predict since I am prepared for any outcome in the rental market.

Options inherently have asymmetrical features. \[5\]

## Principle #3: Post-traumatic growth

&gt;*Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. – Victor Frankl*

Admittedly, this next principle is somewhat trite, but it is perhaps the most important.

We are all familiar with the concept of post-traumatic stress, but less so with its lesser-known cousin, post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic growth occurs when negative experiences spur positive change. \[6\]

It is not the same as being resilient. Resilience is robust—you survive shocks, but they don’t make you better. Post-traumatic growth is anti-fragile—shocks and stressors improve you.

Life will inevitably throw stressful events at us. How we react to these obstacles is our choice. By choosing to look for the good in the bad and to turn every obstacle into an opportunity, we can build anti-fragility.

This way we no longer need to predict since we are prepared.

\[2\] Yes, I did steal this example from [Big Daddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2DFN_YH_Eg).

\[3\] Sometimes, the status quo can actually make anti-fragile things weaker. For example, a lack of stressors or external shocks to muscles causes them to get weaker through atrophy. Another example is forest fires. A lack of forest fires (external shock) weakens forests through the accumulation of combustible materials. This results in forests being more prone to severe fires and higher probability of total loss.

* Which political party will be elected? What policies will they implement?

The point is that no one can balance all these factors to reach an accurate prediction of an outlier event. Doing so would require:

* Determining all the questions (inputs) that need to be answered, including inputs we haven’t yet considered (unknown unknowns)
* Coming up with answers to all the questions
* Considering the implications and interactions between all the inputs and how they influence each other
* Weighing the various inputs appropriately
* Synthesizing them into a non-consensus prediction

I can’t think of a more impossible task.

## The turkey problem

Imagine a turkey that is fed every day by a farmer.

Each passing day will increase the turkey’s confidence in the following statement: “Every day, I will be fed by a friendly farmer.”

However, on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, the turkey’s confidence in that statement will change.

&amp;#x200B;

The turkey problem should clearly highlight the two points below:

* What matters to the turkey is not predicting another “normal” day but, rather, predicting outlier events (e.g., Thanksgiving).
* Using historical inputs and data to make a prediction doesn’t work for outlier events. They are outlier events because people never thought they could happen. Consider this: **The turkey’s confidence in its well-being was highest the day before Thanksgiving, when the risk was also the highest!** It is catastrophic to rely on the past to predict what the future has in store.

## Becoming the fire

&gt;*Wind extinguishes a candle and energizes a fire – Nassim Taleb*

You might point to rare instances in which people have predicted outlier events as evidence that it can be done. Michael Burry famously predicted the housing bubble in 2008 and a Hollywood movie was made about his prediction.

We can ignore this argument because it lacks reliability, a trait required for predictions. Michael Burry has made at least 10 other public stock market related predictions, all of them wrong, for a total record of 1/11. Even the smartest folks, like Mr. Burry, are not able to consistently predict outlier events. \[1\]

Regardless, it doesn’t matter whether you think that predictions are impossible or extremely difficult. There is a better way.

It is much easier to be anti-fragile than smart enough to predict the future.

## The triad

Everything in life is either fragile, robust, or anti-fragile.

Fragile things break when exposed to stressors. Robust things are resistant and absorb shocks. Anti-fragile things gain from stressors: They thrive and grow when exposed to outlier events.

Your glass cup falls from a kitchen table and, upon impact with the ground, breaks. Glass is fragile in this context.

You are Rollerblading in Central Park. Out of nowhere you hit a branch and crash. Your helmet hits the ground, protects your head, and doesn’t break. Your helmet is robust in this context. \[2\]

Your immune system is exposed to a new virus and, after a three-day battle, wins, becoming stronger in the process. Your immune system is anti-fragile in this context.

&amp;#x200B;

## Testing for positive asymmetry

What should be clear is a test for anti-fragility. Anything that has a positive asymmetry (more upside than downside from shocks or outlier events) is anti-fragile.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ntb77lryji2a1.png?width=624&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1c506861743bd9d3ab4c9de1fb6bd303d6c52ad8

There are numerous examples of things that are anti-fragile at different scales.

* Working out makes your body stronger. When exposed to external shock (weightlifting, running, etc.) your body is forced to overcompensate and adapt to meet similar future shocks.
* Wildfires make forests stronger. When a wildfire occurs, it removes the accumulation of combustible material and creates room for new wildlife. \[3\]
* Airlines are anti-fragile at the system level (although fragile at the airplane level). Each airplane crash results in improvement to the overall system (the totality of all airplanes) because of the identification of mistakes and process improvements.

## Size matters

Before we run around seeking exposure to external shocks, it is important to realize that size matters.

The ability of a system, person, or thing to respond with anti-fragile characteristics to a stressor is dependent on the size of the stressor.

Small is better than large because harm is nonlinear. As the size of the shock increases, harm increases faster.

There is a difference between jumping 100 feet once and jumping one foot 100 times. One will kill you; the other will make your bones stronger.

Similarly, there is a difference between exposing your immune system to a small dose of virus (say, via vaccine) and exposing it to a much larger dose. Double the dose results in much more than double the effect.

It is also important that the impact of the shock or stressor not cause total loss. If you are exposed to a viral dose large enough to kill you, your immune system doesn’t have a chance to get stronger.

## Anti-fragility &gt; Prediction

Anti-fragility occurs when systems, or things, have more upside than downside from shocks. When you have anti-fragile characteristics, you don’t need to predict when shocks will occur. You can sleep comfortably knowing that when they do occur, you will benefit.

## Becoming anti-fragile

Let us recap what we know:

* What matters are outlier events
* Predicting outlier events is impossible
* Anti-fragility removes the need for predictions by putting us in a position to benefit from outlier events

The question, then, is how does one become anti-fragile?

Anti-fragility can be achieved with different tactics at different scales.

While I am still learning and updating my thinking, below is a list of some of the principles I have found useful in becoming anti-fragile, along with vignettes to help illustrate the points.

## Principle #1: Redundancy

Anti-fragility is achieved through redundancy. Having extra capacity is a way to benefit from shocks. The difficulty is that redundancy seems wasteful if nothing unusual happens. The key is to be disciplined enough to build redundancy when you don’t need it for when you inevitably do.

*Redundancy and money:* Let me illustrate with a financial example. Having a sizable amount of your wealth in cash (say 10%) will make you anti-fragile. You will miss some short-term gain by not investing this money; however, when shocks or stressors eventually occur, you can be opportunistic, aggressive and have significant upside (e.g., buying assets at a big discount).

Redundancy removes the need for you to predict which outlier event will cause difficulties. External shocks cause value to flow towards a set of basic items. For example, in all of the following scenarios cash increases in value: war, market crashes, revolution, losing your job, pandemic, natural disaster, getting sick, etc. \[4\]

*Redundancy and time:* The same idea applies to time. Having the extra capacity to pursue interests, let your mind wander and explore opportunities that arise has more upside than scheduling every second of your time.

*Redundancy and other systems*: The redundancy principle applies to the system level as well. Hospitals, power grids, supply chains, traffic infrastructure, etc. are all systems that would benefit from having redundancy built in. Airplanes have incredible safety records due to the level of redundancy built in (e.g., they can fly their entire route on one engine and carry at least two hours of extra jet fuel). This principle should be extended to many other aspects of our lives.

Redundancy is often compared to having insurance. However, this comparison is not quite accurate. Insurance limits your downside but doesn’t provide upside (insurance is robust). Redundancy does.

## Principle #2: Optionality

Having options leads to anti-fragility by allowing you to pivot to the most favorable outcome in an uncertain future.

*New York rent:* I live in New York, where rent is atrociously high. Had I been smarter, I would have moved into a rent-controlled apartment. Doing so would make me anti-fragile through optionality.

In a rent-controlled apartment, I have the option to stay for as long as I wish, but no obligation to do so. If I want to move, I easily can. Should rents increase dramatically, I am largely protected. However, should rents collapse, I can easily switch apartments and reduce my monthly expense.

Having this option creates asymmetry. I benefit from lower rents but am not impacted by higher rents. By having options, I don’t need to predict since I am prepared for any outcome in the rental market.

Options inherently have asymmetrical features. \[5\]

## Principle #3: Post-traumatic growth

&gt;*Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response. – Victor Frankl*

Admittedly, this next principle is somewhat trite, but it is perhaps the most important.

We are all familiar with the concept of post-traumatic stress, but less so with its lesser-known cousin, post-traumatic growth. Post-traumatic growth occurs when negative experiences spur positive change. \[6\]

It is not the same as being resilient. Resilience is robust—you survive shocks, but they don’t make you better. Post-traumatic growth is anti-fragile—shocks and stressors improve you.

Life will inevitably throw stressful events at us. How we react to these obstacles is our choice. By choosing to look for the good in the bad and to turn every obstacle into an opportunity, we can build anti-fragility.

This way we no longer need to predict since we are prepared.

\[1\] It is interesting that sometimes you need to be right only once to make enough money and secure enough fame for the rest of your life. Asymmetrical bets, while unreliable, are worth pursuing.

\[2\] Yes, I did steal this example from [Big Daddy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j2DFN_YH_Eg).

\[3\] Sometimes, the status quo can actually make anti-fragile things weaker. For example, a lack of stressors or external shocks to muscles causes them to get weaker through atrophy. Another example is forest fires. A lack of forest fires (external shock) weakens forests through the accumulation of combustible materials. This results in forests being more prone to severe fires and higher probability of total loss.

\[4\] Having extra basic supplies (food, water, toiletries, energy, etc.) would have similar effects as having extra cash in many scenarios as well.

Industry proponents worried the definition would be too broad, capturing entities like miners and other parties that don’t actually facilitate transactions.

Another provision included in the bill to amend tax code section 6050I has also stoked fear in the crypto industry. The law, written nearly 40 years ago to apply to in-person cash transactions over $10,000, essentially requires recipients to verify the sender’s personal information and record his or her Social Security number, the nature of the transaction and other information, and report the transaction to the government within 15 days.""

solana,"Top Solana game builder here: the silver lining to a lower SOL price, and other observations","I am the lead dev on ev.io, a play to earn FPS which is the top Solana game in terms of daily active users. And in the top 5 of games on all blockchains in terms of daily actives... Our project is pretty simple in concept. You buy NFTs on Solana which manifest in the game as character, weapon and sword skins. Equipping these NFTs allow you to earn SOL based on your in-game performance in earn-enabled game modes. Since May we've given out over 130K in SOL, as in-game rewards and as tourney prizes. A good chunk of this money comes from sponsors. 

We chose Solana to build on purely because of the tech. It's ETH with all the benefits of smart contracts, and without the fees. 

Lots of people have been asking: how does the recent market shenanigans affect you. For one, when the price of SOL halved, the average sale price and floor price on our NFTs doubled. The lower price of SOL caused a flurry of secondary market activity, because with SOL at a much cheaper price, people could therefore acquire ev.io NFTs at a much cheaper price. It eliminated lots of old/stale listings that were put up when SOL was valued much higher. In a sense, it stimulated our game economy... sort of like the feds lowering the interest rates, which devalues the dollar. I consider it a silver lining. 

Anyway, other than that, there hasn't been much of an effect. We're pretty used to the market taking a dump on our heads. Our first mint was on May 11th, on the cusp of the Terra Implosion. All our planning was around SOL at a price of $100. But of course, on the day of our mint, the price faltered to 50, then 40 and 30 (now 15). We went ahead with the mint anyway, and people still showed up (even though half couldn't get SOL off exchanges). It was a black swan event, just like FTX. Up until then, even no-name projects selling millions wasn't unheard of. It was definitely the beginning of the bear because the marketplace we ran the mint on stopped doing regular mints after ours. These days, some projects can't even sell out free mints. It went from a waterfall to *drip drip drip* almost overnight. This is the harsh reality of building in crypto: it is a zero sum game. Boom or bust. And that extends almost to everyone during the regular market cycles of bear and bull. Wether it be defi or gaming or what have you. Businesses looking to get in should understand this, and plan accordingly. Larger team sizes was once a boast in the bull market. Now it's a weakness, due to the increased burn rate. Gather ye rosebuds while ye may. 

Fortunately the ev.io team is super small (less than 10 ppl) and that is by design - we want to grow surely and slowly. Like a quality restaurant chain over a copy paste burger franchise. I think another thing that has allowed us to grow during the bear is an emphasis on utility as opposed to speculative value. Lots of NFTs out there priced 100x higher than ours which do essentially nothing. You buy it, and it sits in your wallet doing nothing forever, until you sell it. They are priced higher because they have higher speculative value, and the project owners are good at social engineering people to not list, or to list higher. Or they get celebrities to publicly buy-in. Or conduct wash trades... if you've been a careful observer in the space long enough, you should know all the tricks. And if you're a builder in the space like me, you might have caught rare glimpses of the world that exists behind the curtains of the world in which people are maneuvered into spending thousands on a JPEG.  

We stayed away from all that. Our community isn't a cult you need to pay an exorbitant amount of money to be a member of. Or some kind of happy-go-lucky ""social movement,"" which *incidentally* involves spending an exorbitant amount of money to be a part of. You can play ev.io, and rent out other people's NFTs without spending money. Our value proposition is that you can make decent pocket change, even good money if you are highly skilled at the game, and have fun doing it. 

Anyway, enough shilling. I wanted to share my perspective as a builder in the space. Sentiment in the community hasn't changed much. We've never experienced the mania of the bull market, and perhaps that's for the best. It forces us to focus on realistic business objectives, like product development, cash flow, user acquisition, user retention, etc. As opposed to building hype and speculative value.

1) My first step is to wipe that collections debt, hopefully negotiating it lower.

2) A surprisingly smart and exciting suggestion is to travel cheaply for the next three months in a place like SE Asia. I’m considering places I know in Mexico, or Argentina as well. This allows me a few months to put off the car and rent question, and possibly get my credit score back up a notch.

3) Some suggestions to find a new job. The job I have *already is* my “new job”, in a career I’m excited to be in, with lots of opportunities for growth and promotion.

4) I qualify for unemployment during this offseason, so that brings in helpful income. I also have skills that can make money online.

5) Loud and clear: HELL NO on a $20k car. To those who say I should go carless, “move closer to work”, or take public transit, these just aren’t options for the rural mountainous area I live in. Most recommend a $5k car, which will be feasible in my area, but I’m still considering something up to $10k with a bit less wear and age. I’m trying to find the balance between peace of mind with my finances and peace of mind with my vehicle.

6) I’ll have plenty of options to rent and roommate in my area. Not too worried about this one.

Thanks to everyone who input their advice, even the rude ones. If there’s something specific you think I should know feel free to dm me. Unless it’s about an “investment opportunity”.


#ORIGINAL POST

Due to a series of unfortunate events I have no car and no home. Currently staying with a friend.

I do have a secure job that pays $60k gross and health insurance. However that job is seasonal - after my last paycheck in December I only have this $20k to hold me over until I start up again in mid March.

Using calculators online I’ve calculated:

I should spend no more than $1300 on rent, preferably less than $900. This is doable in my area.

I should spend no more than $20k on a car, with a max $500 on a monthly car payment. Anticipating a 16% interest rate, and a $5k down payment, this is also doable. (Edit: This part is clearly a big hang up. These numbers were from the research I did today. I’m thankful for the advice against it but can’t respond to every comment about it. To answer FAQ, yes, I absolutely need a good car. My job and area needs it. On top of that, my personal hobbies and passions revolve around a good off-road worthy vehicle, so there’s the personal life-satisfaction element involved. No, I don’t need these things, was just hoping to try and plan ahead for that.)

My credit score is 588 - far worse than I realized. I thought it was improving, it was 620 last summer. An old store card got forgotten and went to collections. It’s about $2000 to wipe that debt. I don’t know if paying it right now would improve my credit score enough to improve my chances at renting a place - either way, I have the income stubs to prove my ability to pay.

Here’s my rough breakdown of how I could use the $20k I have

1) $5000 for down payment on a car

2) $5000 set aside for rent for January thru March

3) $2000 for collections

4) $3000 for transitioning costs like applications, moving

5) $5000 for living costs like groceries, gas, and phone

How does this sound? What am I missing?

CryptoCurrency,BTC and The Lightning Network: Will It Succeed?,"Arguably, you cannot scale a blockchain to validate the entire world’s transactions in a decentralized way.

Much like today’s internet and financial system, it is more optimal to comprise the whole system of separate layers, where each layer optimizes for and is used for different things.

The Lightning Network is a separate, second-layer network that works on top of the main Bitcoin network. Simply said, it batches Bitcoin transactions.

A Lightning node: separate software that communicates with each other and constitutes a new peer-to-peer network.

Channels: a connection opened between two Lightning nodes, allowing for payments to flow between them.

The Lightning Network already scales to support 16,264 transactions a second today and therefore solves the scalability problem while preserving all the benefits Bitcoin has to offer — permissionlessness, scarcity, user sovereignty, portability, verifiability, decentralization and censorship resistance.

With 16,266 nodes in the network (as of November 2022), assuming each payment has to go through three channels (four nodes), the network should be able to achieve around 134,194 payments per second.

Visa saw 165 billion payments in 2021, PayPal saw 19.3 billion payments across its whole platform and FedWire saw 204 million. Respectively, these amount to 7,372, 612 and 6.5 payments per second on average for 2021.

It takes each Lightning node to be capable of doing just four payments a second in order to beat the current payment networks by at least two times. At that rate, 4,066 unique four-node groups can achieve 16,264 payments per second — 2.2 times that of the largest competitor, Visa.

To make matters worse for traditional payment networks, the average Lightning transaction fee is 13 times less that of Visa — 0.1% compared to 1.29%.

To give a sense of the progress there, River Financial recently shared that its (lightning) payment success rate is 98.7% at an average size of $46, which is astonishingly better than the earliest publicly-available data it could find from 2018, where $5 transactions were failing 48% of the time.

Do we want the Lightning Network as a solution to the scalability problem and, if so, will it succeed?

personalfinance,Tripled earnings this year - how to save on taxes?,"My earnings this year were three times higher than usual (an investor bought a portion of a company I work for and employees got a payout + higher bonus). I am thinking on how to minimize tax implications. 

A few things that come to mind:

1. We bought a house this year and bought points to lower the interest rate, so that amount should be tax deductible
2. I don't contribute to 401k at all, my husband does. In the one month left till the end of the year can I contribute the maximum amount to lower taxable income?
3. We have an 11yo we haven't set up a college fund for - should we open some sort of 529  until the year-end and invest some funds there?
4. what else can be done not to be hit by huge taxes?

The employee already deducted taxes from the payout but I am afraid that come April I will owe much more. Any advice is appreciated. Location - NY.",finance,1669585101
personalfinance,Prioritizing saving for down payment vs. saving for retirement/401k/Roth IRA,"I want to preface this by saying neither of us know a lot about money management because neither of us come from money. Our parents are both in extreme debt and live with zero retirement plans. I have read the wiki and it’s taught me a lot about general finance but I have a specific question.

My husband and I (both 32 y/o, no children) own a house that we bought in 2018. It’s very much a starter home and not in our desired area and not near either of our jobs ( we got these jobs years after buying the house, this was not on purpose).  Once interest rates improve, hopefully over the next 2 years (any insight on that?) we’d ideally like to buy our forever home, closer to our jobs and family. 

I make 110k annually. My husband makes 65k annually. We both got new jobs in Jan 2022 with significant pay bumps and I want to think about the future more.  Right now my husband invests 6% in his 401k with an employer match of 6%, he has it set to increase 1% annually. I invest 6% in my 401k, I get no employer match.  We do not invest any money. We do not have a Roth IRA.  I understand this is all quite low and we need to make some changes.

However, I am unsure how much to prioritize saving for a down payment on a new home over 401k/ opening a Roth IRA. Our current home was purchased for 165K in 2018. The current estimated value is 230K ( home prices seem quite low here, but property tax is wild, I pay $450/ mo in property tax, so our monthly mortgage all said and done is 1150/ mo). 

-We currently have 30,000 in our savings account. 

-We have one car loan that we owe 9,000 on. 5% interest rate. Payment $488/mo. Other car is paid off, 2016 in good condition. 

-No credit card debt/ personal loans. We pay off our credit card monthly. 

-We have significant student loan debt. Most of it is federal. Our private loans we pay $500/ month on. With the federal pause, we don’t know what our monthly payment will be on those.  As stated above, our parents were poor, they forced us to go to fancy colleges because we both happened to be intelligent and are first gen college graduates, we didn’t understand debt and loans because our parents didn’t. My federal loans will be forgiven with ten years of qualifying payments due to working for a non profit. 

I’m sure this is a stupid question to many of you, but I’m not sure where else to turn to ask this type of stuff. I’m sure the true answer is to live in our old little house forever and invest! Max out 401k! etc, but we do value having a nice home because we spend a ton of time at home. We are homebodies, we don’t go out much or travel much. So it is extremely important to us both that, in the next 2-5 years, we’re in a much nicer home where we can happily stay forever that is also closer to work.",finance,1669585808
personalfinance,"Finished up my masters degree, will start a job in 3 months, need a 0% APR credit card to cover my expenses until my salary starts kicking in, what do you think","I finish in December, I just received my job offer and basically waiting for my legal status (I am an international immigrant) to be able to start and and receive my salary, which could take 2-3 months.

I’m finally making a decent amount of money where I’m not living paycheck to paycheck and I want to pay off my debt. I had a friend that also was in credit card debt and got a loan through a credit union to pay off the debt and lower the interest rate. They told him the best thing would be to do a loan for 2 years because for 1 year it would look bad on their credit report. I want to pay off my debt within a year so the question is should I apply to possibly get a credit card that has a 8k limit with 0% interest to transfer my debt to it or get a loan and pay it off in the 1 year and “look bad” on my report?

personalfinance,How Does My Plan Sound?,"Hello All, 

I was hoping to get some feedback on the financial plan that I’ve laid out for myself.  Here’s some quick details about me and my situation.  I am trying to decide how I should go about handling the next couple of years.  

I am a 27 year old with an electrical engineering degree from a reputable state school.  I currently make $74,000/year (~$50,600 take home), with a pay increase to $80,000 happening either this coming spring, or spring of 2024.  I currently have $17,685 worth of federal student loan debt and $32,400 tied up in a loan that my parents took out from our local bank to help fund my education.  The interest rates on the federal loans vary between 4.66 and 3.86 percent, and the private loan is a 3.76 percent.  The monthly payments are $250 and $655 respectively.  

Now for the plan.  

I am planning on moving out (again), and I’d like to have most of my debt taken care of before I move into my own house.  I was planning on paying off the private loan first, since the federal loans are eligible for forgiveness and the fact that the monthly payment isn’t too bad along with the fact that I’m spending much more in interest on that loan.  I should be able to do this by next November if I use my second paycheck from each month to pay down the private loan.  Once the private loan would be paid off, I’d ideally like to devote 3/4 of my take home pay towards an emergency fund and a very healthy down payment.  

I’m okay with keeping the federal loans around to help establish a solid credit history.  Does this plan sound solid?  Or should I change things around?

Chevron was granted a new license to operate in Venezuela on Saturday the 26th of November

Chevron they have a lot of work to do

1. repair broken equipment
2. stop power outages
3. fix pipelines
4. rehire hundreds of workers
5. security threats involving gasoline theft

Venezuelan analysts are estimating about 50 billion in expenses to restore the lost oil production in Venezuela

So within the next 6 months we can expect chevron to increase output by around 20,00 to 30,000 barrels a day, which doesn’t make much a difference to the global market

We’re expecting about a year at the least for Chevron &amp; their joint venture partner Petroleos de Venezuela to bring oil production back to 200,000 barrels a day

**Price Cap + Embargo**

The European commission and the G-7 are looking to put a cap on Russian crude at around 60 to 70 a barrel

Russian crude has now fallen to 56 a barrel so it’s actually below the cap at the moment

The problem is that countries are saying this cap is too high and doesn’t do much to curb the kremlin’s revenues

The EU is also planning on putting an embargo on Russian crude said to take effect on December 5th

**Opec + Meeting**

We also have an OPEC + meeting December 4th and now we’re starting to hear whispers of a partial reversal of the 2m barrel a day production cut. At the same time we’re getting prince Abdulaziz calling for more production cuts. The news here is a little bit mixed, but likely where this goes will be determined after what happens with the EU embargo and the Russian crude price cap.

and what are oil futures doing right now? Take a look [Here](https://i.postimg.cc/BnQYmMYc/image.png)

Down a whopping 2.7%

So long story short, watch out. This is likely the biggest news we will new in the coming weeks prior to CPI and Fed Economic forecast meeting.

38. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

62. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout.

personalfinance,Should i get a personal loan to pay off $8k of credit card debt?,"So unfortunately, my mom fell sick in 2019 and i had to try to cover all the bills as a full time college student. Working full time as well i could barely cover our rent so everything that could go on a credit card, did. Gas, food, other bills etc. 

So after almost two years of that i racked up a lot of debt. Now three years later i have a total of $8k left on my credit card. I have a part time job since i’m now in grad school so i don’t make enough to pay a lot more than the minimum. 

I’m considering getting a personal loan bc my interest rate with this credit card is 26.74%. If anyone has any suggestions I’d greatly appreciate it! my reason for wanting a personal loan is to obviously get rid of all that high interest debt and move it somewhere i can actually pay it off faster. I’ve already inquired about a balance transfer and they said no… and i don’t think there’s an interest rate low enough that they could offer me that would be worth keeping my debt with them",finance,1669619763

personalfinance,Sudden job transfer with a home to sell 4 states away &amp; living in an expensive airbnb - help?,"Hello all -

This is a little long so I want to thank anyone willing to read through it and offer any genuine advice. While we have very good credit and until a month ago, not much debt, that's only due to the fact that my husband makes a good salary which has allowed us to not prioritize budgeting or financial responsibility and instead play it kind of loose. This means we don't have a lot of savings either. This is why we're desperate for help because we honestly don't know how to figure out the best financial decision for the following problem we find ourselves in. 
-  

# **What happened**

My husband was abruptly downsized from his job (along with his entire department) in September but thankfully received a job offer within the same month. The catch is - it's 4 states away from the house we've owned for 22 years. The extra challenge - we had two weeks to pack up, put everything in storage &amp; get the house on the market so he could report to work two weeks later. It's been kind of a nightmare.

**Stress**

Due to the very short notice, I had to quit my job and we didn't have any time to find a proper place to rent. Since we've never even been to this state until we got here, we also had no clue where the safe areas of town were, what the traffic would be like, etc. So we chose an airbnb and thankfully, his company has covered the rent through November 30th. 

-  

We have a contract on a house here with a contingency to sell our old house, but due to the delay because the roof needed replaced which set us back 3 weeks, it's probably going to run out. Even in a hot market, I can't see how we'll get a good offer on our house and be able to close by December 6th, the date the contract expires. This is the only way we can close on the house here as required by our new mortgage lender.

-  

While the loan request can be extended, the seller is making noise about having to extend the closing date. His own listing agent is not very good and even told us we are the only people who've shown any serious interest in the house (it's a little ways out of the city) in the 90 days it's been listed. But the seller has no idea she told us that (I'm not even sure if she's allowed to tell us that?) We already had the inspected and the repairs made, so selling our place is the only thing holding us back. 

-  

Because of this, we've been desperately trying to figure out where to go next. 

-  

While there *is* a (probably low) chance of a cash buyer putting an offer on our house tomorrow which would allow us to being able to close on time with the house here, it's highly unlikely. This means we have to find somewhere more affordable than an airbnb, which costs us **double** our monthly mortgage, taxes &amp; insurance. This is a bad financial decision that would put us in credit card debt because we still have to make our December house payment, taxes, insurance and utilities at our old house. 

-  

# **The positive**
Luckily, our house is in a very hot market. The top 1% of the country at the moment, despite the interest rates, winter, the holidays, etc. There is high demand, low inventory and the homes sell at or above asking price within a few days. We also have an excellent agent who is the owner of the brokerage &amp; very motivated to sell our home. Unfortunately, as I mentioned, we had a slight setback for 3 weeks because we found out we had to have the roof replaced. So it goes on the market tomorrow. But that's where  comes in.

-

# **The Problem**
We put an offer on a house here that expires December 5th. We had a contingency that we had to sell our home first. We didn't think it would be a problem because of how hot the market is. But real estate is unpredictable and stressful and rarely works out as planned. So that's probably not going to happen and even if we got an extension, it's still probably a month before we'd close, under perfect circumstances.

-

# *At least she's good*
Our agent owns her own very successful brokerage and is the one selling our house. She's been on top of everything and knows exactly what she's doing. She sold our last house for us 22 years ago and has a very good reputation, so that's one less thing to worry about at the moment. But the timing is slightly off and we're really stuck with no idea what to do.

-   

Our current mortgage, taxes and insurance total **$2500** a month with utilities adding another $250 on average, sometimes more because it's very cold in winter and very hot in summer. The total we've always budgeted is approximately **$2750/month.**

-

# **Our options:**

-  rent the **Airbnb** ourselves, which would be convenient because we're already here &amp; it's furnished. Also there's no lease and we can leave without penalty anytime we want.  **But** it's very expensive - almost *double* the cost of the combination of our mortgage, taxes, homeowners insurance, etc on our own home and we're because paying $650/month for our entire household which is in storage.  We could do this for one month but absolutely no longer without incurring a lot of debt. The rent is $3700 a month, plus we'd have to pay the $700 in storage fees. We don't pay utilities here.  This would free us up to immediately buy another house if we found one (we've found several we really like) and probably move in by February 1st. **Total cost monthly: $4400**

-

# *Short?*
-  rent a short term (6 months) unfurnished studio apartment which would cost much less than the airbnb and be a little more stable. The monthly cost is also a bit closer to our current house payment. We HOPE we'll only need to pay the rent on the studio *and* the house payment together for just the December payment, but it's not a given. It also means we're stuck in a 6 month lease with no early termination clause. 

-  This would mean we would have to wait until spring to buy, putting us in the home selling season = higher prices and more competition. And since it's very small, we'd still have to pay the monthly storage fees. We would also have initial costs of $1085 in ""move in fees"" (non refundable) and because the unfurnished studio is only 600 sq feet, we'd have to also spend money on a new bed, sofa and small dining table and still pay for our storage fees. $1350 rent + $700 storage fees + $200 utilities + another bunch of non-negotiable money grab fees required by the rental company (dog rent $50, trash 'valet' $25 and 'short term lease premium' $50 is a total monthly cost of **$2475**

-  

# *Long lost loser*
-  rent a house for a year $1595/m. This means we'll be buying in an unknown market a year from now *(interest rates could drop, housing prices could increase &amp; there would be more competition)* which could mean we might have to buy a house that needs some work *(after 22 years of updating our home, we REALLY don't want to do any more home improvement projects)* or have to buy in a less desirable area. However, because the longer term rental house is around the same size as our old one, we could get everything out of storage, saving the $700/m storage fees, there wouldn't be any 'short term lease premium' the dog rent fee is less at $40/m, no 'trash valet' but there is some 'air filter maintenance' program required $35/m (again, all non-negotiable from the rental company), and the utilities would be a little higher, about $300. Plus it's 30 minutes each way from work. **The total cost: $1965**

-  

^Bad ^Math
(my math could be totally wrong, please excuse it, I'm stressed &amp; it's late).

-  

# **Why we're irresponsible idiots**

We have no idea which is the most financially responsible way to go. After weeks of desperate searching there is only one house available and one studio available that allow dogs, are in safe areas, are sort of in our price range and available right now. If we stay in the $110/night airbnb until December 6th to wait to find out what happens with our house, we could lose one or both of those options and be stuck here (or another airbnb) which would be a financial nightmare as it would all have to go on a credit card. And this place is ""only"" $4400 a month because it's in a terrible neighborhood, anything in a neighborhood where we're not worried about being mugged or attacked by stray dogs is no less than $5500/m.

#  Any suggestions for the brave souls who made it this far?

**Tldr:** suddenly transferred to a new state with only 2 weeks notice to pack up our home of 22 years &amp; get it on the market. In an expensive airbnb waiting for the house to sell with no idea where to go next and we have to be out of the airbnb by 10am November 30th

CryptoCurrency,UK CEX with Perpetual Trading (Futures)?,"Hi. I've been using Kucoin for a while because Binance don't have Futures in UK but am fed up with the massive amount of maintenance shut downs Kucoin always have at times of high volatility. I'm pretty sure they do it to stop cutomers making decent profits.

So I need a new CEX. I really like the clean UI of Kucoin and Binance, whereas, I looked at PrimeXBT and hated their UI - too messy. Having a phone app is essential.

Obviously,  SAFU is important in these times.

Please, all recommendations appreciated.

personalfinance,"Cheap loans, High Interest Savings","Hi everyone sorry if this is the wrong place to do this but I was looking on my credit score app and they give me offers from varies companies for loans, credit cards and other forms of credit.

The one loan that has my interest in particular is a £15,000 @3.5% APR over 7 years. I thought it was extremely inexpensive at 3.5% Interest, so I checked a fixed Interest rate savings account and they're ranging from 4% on a 1 year fixed rate savings account, all the way up to 5.55% on a 5 year fixed rate savings account.

Effectively meaning every year I'd gain between 0.5% - 2.05% on money that I didn't have in the first place, only having to pay back the principal.

I understand there would be risk involved, but my career is very secure, so there's no reason why I'd end up unemployed and always be capable of paying the loan back.

Am I missing something or have I find a way to gain wealth?

Thank you for all your comments and advice.",finance,1669631161

Forex,Risk Premium - Building a Foundation for Trading,"If I were able to go back in time to the beginning of my trading journey with one idea, it would be “risk premia.” It is vital for any trader to understand the idea of risk, and how you are compensated by taking on said risk. Risk premia/premium should be the very foundation upon which you build upon. I consider it the easiest way to make money. All you must do is hold an asset for a certain amount of time to generate returns. This is why buy-and-hold is often the benchmark to see if a more active system is worth the effort. For equities, you see stockholders taking advantage of risk premium to generate higher returns than treasury bonds (risk-“free” rates). As interest rates get higher, so do the risk-free rates, which makes stocks look less attractive. 

It's a lot easier to paint a picture using bonds. Bonds are used by companies or governments to raise money from investors. While bond prices have an impact on how investors make decisions, we will use flat numbers to keep things simple. Assuming bond price of $100 per bond and 5% interest rates for both, if you had the choice between buying bonds from Microsoft or from the local grocery store, which one would you choose?

A more risk-savvy investor would always choose the Microsoft bonds, as they are much less at risk of defaulting or failing to pay investors back. Now, if the local grocery store offered 15% interest, investors would then consider the difference in interest rates to decide. Since there’s a 10% spread in interest, the risk premium is 10%. For accepting a higher risk of default, you accrue 10% more interest on your investment. These opportunities appear in Forex, but they aren’t nearly as apparent.

[Here](https://deliverypdf.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=921074095001015090072070005079118089123035081036074048121092013014111000030094002026005050101012008098014077001125095103121089102059062029068024025107006010016097076064061012124102120015068023091092107000115093083102026004001091064023124029093008119005&amp;EXT=pdf&amp;INDEX=TRUE) is a research paper that explores the idea of how risk premium causes seasonality, or patterns in price that occur at regular intervals. This is a very heavy read for most traders, but the gist of it is this: Holders of USD are exposed to the negative fundamental news that affects the dollar during the New York open. As EUR is naturally a riskier currency (blanket monetary policy over several countries with different levels of economic health is not ideal) than the USD, it must appreciate to compensate investors for holding onto a riskier asset. The holders of the USD know their currency is exposed to more risk during the NY session, so they move to an asset that is less exposed to these events. JPY is where risk-averse investors will flee to. Meaning, the USD value falls during the NY session as investors move to a safer currency. The safer currency is JPY. The increased supply of USD naturally means a stronger EUR. Simple supply and demand mechanics.

* “When introduced to a new idea, always ask why you should care. Do not expect an answer right away but demand an answer eventually.“ – Ravi Vikal

If you’ve made it this far, this is why you should care. Here is what we call a market inefficiency. There’s a repeating pattern in that offers active traders a chance to gain abnormal returns on a daily basis. All due to a risk-based assessment of the market. Risk causes uncertainty, which we can take on in exchange for alpha.

So, the strategy. We buy EUR when the NY session opens and sell when it closes. Then short EUR and GBP when the London session starts. We will test from the beginning of 2002 to Oct 2022, so almost a 20-year backtest. The [chart](https://i.ibb.co/hFhm9Bg/seasonality2-EURUSD.png) and [stats](https://pastebin.com/bz6vcYnw). Well, it appears that the author may have been onto something. Now let’s see what happens when we add GBP and JPY into the mix. Here we keep the original strategy but sell JPY on the NY market open and buy when the Tokyo session starts. We also buy and sell GBP in the same manner as EUR. Here is the [chart](https://i.ibb.co/6RmX0Hc/seasonality3-EURUSD.png), and [stats](https://pastebin.com/B6vN7t4q). While admittedly not as impressive, it still shows the pattern is there. Considering we're exposed to market risk around the clock, I'm honestly surprised this came out so positive. The point of concern here is the flat equity curve in recent years. This may be due to increased intraday volatility plus central bank intervention from both JPY and GBP this year. While volatility can make us money, it is not always our friend. The amount of liquidity and lack of intervention in the EUR may be our saving grace with this strategy, but as the stats show, JPY might be the most profitable asset. So, let’s find out. The [chart](https://i.ibb.co/mhhBq2y/seasonality4-USDJPY.png) and [stats](https://pastebin.com/mzEqZvDg). Again, not as impressive. Seems like focusing on the more stable EUR is the best way to trade this idea.

Let’s talk about tempering expectations though. There are no trading costs considered, as this is a “perfect world” testing environment. We’re just seeing if the idea holds, and it appears to do so. This strategy may or may not be tradeable depending on your broker’s trading environment, in fact, I suggest you don't trade this until you come up with a risk and money management strategy. The backtest results are extremely optimistic (this is my disclaimer). There are also no stop losses or take profits, so a clever trader may incorporate something like ATR to make it a more profitable idea.

What we have here is a trading strategy based on a real market inefficiency. No fitting stories to price curves, no market myths, and hard evidence that the idea works. The strategy is extremely simple with hard quantifiable rules. While the average profit is very low, remember that we have not set any take-profit rules, stop losses, reinvestment strategies, or risk management rules, meaning it assumes lot sizes do not change as the account grows. There is plenty to build upon and experiment with. While trading is very difficult, all you really need is one discovery and a bit of creativity to be successful. For example, here is a free potential edge you can imply from this research and mess around with.

* What else is correlated with the rise and fall of currencies? Indices. [Most gains on the S&amp;P 500 occur overnight](https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-stocks-overnight-idUSKBN26J0G6), which falls in line with the appreciation of the JPY during the Tokyo session and the depreciation of the EUR during the London session. These also tend to be commission free on most brokers, so all you need to worry about is the spread, which shouldn’t be an issue due to the potential gains. However, you are essentially trading directionally with no hedging.

My intention with this post is to stop the infighting about different trading strategies and encourage users here to dig to find research on trading strategies that follow actual market mechanics. They are out there, but sometimes you need a second pair of eyes and another brain to really understand what the research is saying along with finding the implications of said research. The best thing you can do when it comes to trading is to collaborate with others and share ideas and findings. Having hard evidence that these ideas and findings are real is key though.

Credit: A user named [PCZ](https://opserver.de/ubb7/ubbthreads.php?ubb=showflat&amp;Number=459925&amp;page=1) on the Zorro forums was where I got this idea from. Part of the point I wanted to prove is that finding profitable and statistically proven strategies is possible if you look hard enough. These papers often include a trading strategy as well. I will be the first to admit that none of my trading strategies are original, but modified versions using techniques I’ve picked up over time. My code will be left as an exercise for my fellow programmers (I’m sure any of you can figure it out with some effort), but please note that I use true-to-life market open times rather than what the user found to be the best so results will vary.",finance,1669638232

# [Stock futures fall as unrest in China grows over Covid restrictions](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/27/stock-futures-slip-after-a-winning-holiday-week-.html)
*****
&gt; Stock futures fell Monday as social unrest from China’s prolonged Covid restrictions weighed on markets, sending oil prices lower — after Wall Street notched gains during the Thanksgiving holiday-shortened week.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 178 points, or 0.5%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures each dropped 0.7%.
*****
&gt; Over the weekend, demonstrations broke out in mainland China as people vented their frustrations with Beijing’s zero-Covid policy. Local governments tightened Covid controls as cases surged, even though earlier this month Beijing adjusted some policies that suggested the world’s second-biggest economy was on its way to reopening.
*****
&gt; The developments weighed on sentiment in Asia trading, with oil futures hovering around new 2022 lows around demand concerns. Shares of companies with big production facilities in the country led premarket losses. Shares of Apple lost 1.7% and Tesla declined 2.2% in premarket trading.
*****
&gt; The moves come after all three major U.S. indexes ended last week higher, even with the shortened trading time due to the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow rose 1.78%, and the S&amp;P 500 increased 1.53% during the short week. The tech-heavy Nasdaq lagged the other two indexes but was still up 0.72% in the same timeframe.
*****
&gt; Stocks were lifted during the week by comments from Federal Reserve officials signaling that the central bank would step down its aggressive rate hike path as inflation cools. Minutes from the Fed’s November meeting confirmed the likely shift in policy.
*****
&gt; “A substantial majority of participants judged that a slowing in the pace of increase would likely soon be appropriate,” the minutes stated.
*****
&gt; In the last week of November, investors will be watching more earnings reports and a slew of economic releases that will give further information on the state of the consumer and the U.S. economy. Intuit, Salesforce and Five Below are among companies scheduled to report earnings. Personal consumption data and the labor report for November will also be released this week.

&gt; **Apple (AAPL)** – Apple could reportedly see a production shortfall of close to 6 million iPhone Pro models due to Covid-related unrest at contract manufacturer Foxconn’s China factory. A person familiar with assembly operations told Bloomberg that Apple and Foxconn do expect to be able to make up that shortfall in 2023. Apple slid 1.7% in premarket trading.

personalfinance,Please Help With ESOP Rollover,"Former company got bought and the ESOP is being distributed earlier than expected.   I have a ""Rollover IRA"" and a ""Roth IRA"" with Vanguard, and I'm looking for advice on how best to rollover the ESOP.

On the ""Election of Direct Rollover"" form, I have to select whether I want the rollover into a Traditional IRA or Roth IRA.  It also says the following:

&gt;If you choose a rollover to a Roth IRA you will be required to include in gross income the taxable portion of the conversion amount. You do also have the ability to elect that a portion of your distribution be withheld and deposited to offset the tax liability which will be incurred by choosing to receive a rollover to a Roth IRA.  If you do not make an election below and you are electing a rollover to a Roth IRA then 10% will be withheld.  
&gt;  
&gt;I elect the following Federal Tax withholding option:  
&gt;  
&gt;\[ \] I do not want to have Federal Income Tax withheld from my Direct Rollover to a Roth IRA  
&gt;  
&gt;\[ \] I want to have \_\_\_\_\_% Federal Income Tax withheld from my Direct Rollover to a Roth IRA  
&gt;  
&gt;By signing and submitting this form I acknowledge that regardless of my tax withholding election, I am still liable for payment of Federal Income Tax on the taxable portion of my Direct Rollover to a Roth IRA.

1. **I assume that an ESOP, which is what I'm rolling over, is all pre-tax?**
2. **If this is the case,** **should I roll it into my Roth IRA or my Rollover IRA?**
3. **And if so, what option should I select above?**

If it matters, I am 34 y/o, make $117k.

Thank you!

**edit:  I checked with the ESOP employer, and it is pre-tax, so that answers #1.  When I went through the online rollover directions on Vanguard's site, it automatically selected my Rollover IRA plan, so #2 is also answered.  I assume that on the ""Election of Direct Rollover"" form I should select to rollover into a Traditional IRA, which then negates the selections above for question #3?**",finance,1669646150

Am I understanding that correctly?

If so, how/when do I pay taxes on this contribution since Roth contributions are taxable?  Will this automatically be calculated for me and noted on some tax form that I get in the mail, or do I need to keep track of this myself and ensure I include when I file my taxes?

economy,question about Fed's QE policy,"I'm not sure what are the methods that the Fed uses in order to increase the money supply. According to official version the Fed purchases privately held securities and lowers the interest rates, but I doubt that those are their only tools. In fact in the last 10 years the Fed has doubled the money supply from 10 trillion to 20 in USA, and I doubt that they were able to do that just by buying securities and lowering the interest rates. 

Bottom line is that it looks like that the Fed targets only certain groups when issuing new money. That means that a selective few enjoy the new money influx, but when the money is introduced to the circulation everybody pays the price by losing value of their savings due to inflation. 

So it got me wondering, that seems not fair and should be kinda illegal. Instead why doesn't the Fed distribute the new money evenly among the population?   

For example let's say the Fed wants to increase the money supply by 10% percent. So why doesn't the Fed increase all privately held deposits by 10%, by simply wiring to people money to their bank accounts? For example if you have 1000$ in your bank, you will be awarded additional 100$ from the Fed. That way everybody will share the burden of inflation evenly, and in theory the inflation will cancel itself out.

personalfinance,Estimating homeownership costs and risks,"I'm pursuing a housing assistance program in DC, which could provide me with a deferred no-interest loan to use for down payment if I am approved and end up moving forward with it.  Rates are terrible, prices are high, and while I'm waiting to see if I get approved I am trying to estimate and evaluate costs--as well as get an idea of how badly I'd be screwed if anything went wrong.  A lot of the cost estimations seem to be based on the ratio of monthly mortgage to income, but I would rather make decisions based on total costs:income.

What costs do I need to be aware of, and how should I estimate them?  And, what remedial options are available if I run into trouble?  My general understanding is that there are state and federal mortgage support programs if you fall behind, and that barring that bankruptcy/foreclosure/eviction.  Bankruptcy can potentially stall or stop other debts, but a lapse in mortgage payments would move forward into foreclosure regardless.  This would ruin my credit and put (non retirement) assets up for confiscation, with a handful of exclusions.

Right now I have the following on my radar:
Loan repayment (deferred 5 years, then monthly)
Monthly mortgage
Monthly PMI
Annual or monthly HOA/condo fees
Property taxes
Utilities
Maintenance
Title insurance (land)
Title insurance (unit/house)

I currently owe $46,560 in loans and credit card debt total.

$18,155.79-17.87% APR and Monthly is $445.08
$5,527.18-12.54% APR and Monthly is $585.48

$1,699.90-24.99% APR and Monthly is $61.00
$1,912.60-24.99% APR and Monthly is $57.00
$4,485.25-17.80% APR and Monthly is $100.00

Total in Credit Card Debt is $16,850.51

Also, my Credit Score is currently at 689

I have an investment of $400-$500 a month

Should I consider debt consolidation which I was approve for $22,102.94 with Net of $21,000 with APR of 18.74% for 48 months with a monthly payment of $657.85 or should I consider accredited debt relief?

If I use the debt consolidation of $21,000 to pay off the $5.527.18 loan as well as the 3 credit card with the biggest APR as well as the rest into the $4,485.25 credit with whatever is left of the $21,000 debt consolidation loan. Would it improve my overall finance in reduce my compounding interest on credits cards as well as reducing my monthly payment so I can focus more on the other one and slowly snowball the rest of the loan debt?

If I were to consolidate my debt I was considered on paying off one of the highest monthly payment loan and all of the credit card or most of it starting with the highest APR first. This will reduce my monthly payment and save me the compounding interest rate from the credit card as well since I have cut them all up already until they send me new one when they are close to expiring which is 2-3 years from now.

Which is a better course of action? Because I am slowly dipping into my investments to make up whatever I am short every month after all the expenses. The loans are due to being out of work during Covid as well as my wife giving birth and the expenses during Covid raising my daughter. Total household income varies between $2,400-$3,000 a month and currently trying to look for another part time job. What is the best course of action at the moment?

stocks,State Coincident Indexes - Not Looking Good,"One key  economic metric that I watch for recession indication are the State Coincident Indexes put  out by the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia (link below).  They have deteriorated significantly over the last 4-6 months.  Currently the values are in line with the economy being within 6 months of a recession based on past performance.

The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

The imugr link below is the percentage of states with a positive month-over-month growth minus those with a negative growth over the entire timeframe covered by the Philadelphia Fed.

personalfinance,Applying credit card balance transfers,"I have two credit cards, call them A and B, with two different banks. I usually pay off my balances in full every month to avoid interest. Recently, card A offered a balance transfer with 12 months of 0% interest (for a 3% fee); at the same time I had some moderately expensive repairs to my car. So, I put the repairs on card B, transferred the balance to card A, and bought a one-year CD (at 4.75%) for the money that I would otherwise have used to pay off the balance on card B. So far so good: In a year I will collect the CD, pay the transfer balance, and pocket the 1.75% difference.

Even more recently, I paid (using card A) for airline tickets for upcoming Christmas travel. Now card A has a purchase balance (with the usual extremely high APR) in addition to the transfer balance (at 0% APR). And then along comes card B and offers me the same balance-transfer deal! 0% APR for a year, 3% fee - which I can get back with some extra by putting the money in a CD. However, I'm not sure how the balance transfer will be applied to the balances on card A. Will it be put towards the high-interest-rate purchase balance that I want to get rid of, or towards the no-interest transfer balance that is fine where it is?

To be clear, I have the money to pay off the purchase balance; I just don't want to do so if I can instead put it in a CD at 4.75%. Sure, it won't be a whole lot of money but it's the principle of the thing.

I called card A's customer service, and they told me that balance transfers are applied to the *lowest interest rate balance* first. Very unfortunate! But then I read [this article](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/how-credit-card-payments-applied) which claims that payments other than the minimum legally must be applied to the highest-interest-rate balance first. (And if it's on the Internet it must be true, right?) So now I'm confused. Was my customer-service representative wrong? Is bank A operating illegally? Are balance transfers an exception to the rule? Or is the article wrong?",finance,1669671558
CryptoCurrency,Combating Sensationalism in Crypto &amp; the Importance of DYOR,"Hey everyone,

I just wanted to take a second here and show how easy it is to get wrapped up in the chaos that social media can typically devolve into - and how it can help to spread misinformation or sensationalism.

I fully believe it is very important to always DYOR, especially since you never know the full intentions of authors of the content you potentially read each day. I'm going to use an example of a post made today on a topic that I am familiar enough with to at least demonstrate the basics of the general concept of this post.

A recent post on r/cc today discusses red flags at a crypto lending company called Nexo.

* Nexo's website: [https://nexo.io/](https://nexo.io/)
* The Reddit post in question: [https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/z72hm7/nexo\_is\_full\_of\_red\_flags\_and\_could\_be\_the\_next/](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/z72hm7/nexo_is_full_of_red_flags_and_could_be_the_next/)

The author of said Reddit post essentially regurgitates a thread made by DylanLeClair\_ on Twitter ([https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair\_/status/1596948568329588736](https://twitter.com/DylanLeClair_/status/1596948568329588736)), which gained quite a bit of traction yesterday. Perhaps it was out of the goodness of his/her heart, maybe it was for moons, but regardless, the Redditor took the content (and images) of the thread and posted it here as their own semi-content (at least they included a screenshot of LeClair's Tweet).

Ignoring perhaps a sufficient amount of attribution to the source of the post, there are a few things included that the original source kind of obscured. Maybe on purpose, maybe due to misinformation they had themselves, who knows. But let me take a second to point out the discrepancies and show you how and why it's important to do this thing we call ""DYOR"".

The first thing to note here is that both Dylan and the Redditor fail to claim that this 10% rate from Nexo is only while holding the highest level of loyalty on Nexo's platform - which means requiring holding 10% of the total value of account holdings in NEXO tokens on the Nexo platform.

Admittedly this is a tad deceiving, but not such a tremendous deal. Just a little omission to get the author's point across I'm sure. If you're curious to know, Nexo's base rate for stablecoins is actually 8% instead (still high, but not just blanket 10%-high).

Interestingly to mention, this graphic is also made carefully to exclude earn rates from a wide variety of other sources. Abra ([abra.com](https://abra.com)) for example, has earning rates of up to 10% on USDT ([https://www.abra.com/boost/](https://www.abra.com/boost/)), Ledn offers 8% APY on USDC ([https://ledn.io/legal/rates-terms](https://ledn.io/legal/rates-terms)), and God forbid US short term treasuries are up to over 4% (as mentioned by Dylan's text if you go to his thread). 

Receiving 4% from the US Government, the strongest borrower in the world's market, means earning anything less than that is... well frankly a head-scratcher. The higher your earning rate is above the FED's rate, the more risk you essentially take on. To better prove this point, go ahead and take a look at the bond rates of variously rated corporations - the riskier the corporation's rating (AAA vs AA vs A vs BBB, for example), the higher the lending rate you will receive (along with a few other variables including time, ability to recall early, etc.)

The point being, it's of course not the end of the world to not include more information in this image, but the sources picked were chosen deliberately in order to probably mislead and better sensationalize the post. This is something you can snuff out quickly if you spend a lot of time in the markets, but for newer investors (or people with less time on their hands), it can understandably be quite alarming at a glance.

Returning to the Reddit post, the poster asks, ""Where does this yield come from?"" 

**This is always a good question to ask.** This is the question every lender should ask when interacting or making their money ""work"". Who are you giving your money to and why are they able to pay you anything for it? Every yield generating opportunity in the world requires some level of risk, and typically the lender is rewarded more or less according to the risk (thanks to the free market). 

Nexo released a Twitter thread answering this question in part today: [https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268175598813186](https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268175598813186). 

It's a pretty interesting read, especially if you're interested in how some of these platforms generate the yields they are paying. Not every lender is the same, however, and understanding each's business model and if they seem sustainable is something you need to figure out for yourself (hence DYOR). 

When Celsius was lending out loans at 0% rates and had no automatic liquidations, should that have been something to think about? Personally, that's the specific reason I never had money in Celsius - I couldn't figure out how that was sustainable. That information wasn't hidden. Make sure to research where your funds are going and whether you believe you can trust who's holding them. 

Going back to Nexo's Tweet, it's important to note that this thread **wasn't** released when Dylan's Tweet had been posted. But if the Redditor had tried to do any sort of DYOR, he/she would have seen that this Tweet was actually published prior to the time of releasing their post. It offers an explanation to many of the points brought up, such as why are so many NEXO tokens are held on the Nexo platform (which helps give context to that 10% rate from earlier, in fact), and could have been included as a way to help balance out a full discussion on the topic instead of primarily fearmongering (I know, an informational discussion on r/cc? How dare I suggest such a thing). 

That being said, much of this info on Nexo's business model wasn't new, but it required digging through their material from over the years. Perhaps too much work for a quick Reddit thread I admit, but I would have hoped Dylan might have done a little bit of research before his post due to his popularity in the scene (at least to show the 10% is a loyalty rate and not the default stablecoin rate - which is at 8% currently), and that the Redditor might have checked around at least a minimum for information before posting. 

Both Dylan and the Redditor's posts reference the following infographics, with the Reddit post going as far as to state that ""85% of Nexo's total assets held on Ethereum are Nexo tokens. **This means that the platform’s backing could become compromised if liquidity issues mount**. "" 

https://preview.redd.it/2xp4bw9nar2a1.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=688d5a6a60870dafd5d96055e385de4a755d6e9c

Surprisingly enough, the Nexo token is an exchange token that only gives you benefits if you keep it on the exchange. Of course they have the majority of the Nexo tokens on their platform - if you didn't keep your Nexo tokens on the platform they don't do a whole lot for you otherwise.

Nexo has repeatedly come out and stated that they themselves hold less than 10% of all of their own assets in NEXO tokens and that they've never used them as collateral for receiving loans ([https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268261716250624](https://twitter.com/Nexo/status/1597268261716250624)). They even said that if you zeroed out the value of their own NEXO tokens, their assets still exceed customer liabilities, which can be checked daily by Armanino's attestation ([https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo](https://real-time-attest.trustexplorer.io/nexo)).

In essence, these tokens are overwhelmingly held by their patrons, and kept on their platform. If the NEXO token goes to $0, the liability for these assets will also be $0. 

The Reddit post ends with, ""Nexo is full of red flags and could be the next company to fall!"" 

Could they be the next to fall? Sure. But the point I'm trying to make is that it's really easy to get caught up in false or misunderstood information created by users on social media, which then gets regurgitated and ends up sitting conveniently on your phone screen. 

Even the Redditor who made the post in question has comments telling others to not post Fake News:

https://preview.redd.it/wlwwuvjzhr2a1.png?width=641&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=73269c8667c485ced8920da77dca238f048d420d

It just goes to show that it's hard to sometimes get your facts straight and why you should always DYOR yourself, even from those with the best intentions.

Please do note that I personally utilize some of Nexo's services, which is why I am familiar enough with the topic to write a post like this. Right now is a scary time in crypto and the fear is understandable. What you do with your assets is your business. Just remember to actually DYOR and always take things that you read here with a grain of salt (including this post too of course!). 

The space is tricky enough - give yourself every advantage you can in order to keep you and your money safe. God bless\~",cryptocurrency,1669672132

This time the inflation is caused by Russia, cutting off 1/3 of the world's wheat by invading Ukraine and being sanctioned, cutting of a huge chuck of oil and natural gas.  So what does J Powell do?  Raise interest rates to wreck the economy more.  Rather than working to increase supplies, they wreck the economy.

personalfinance,Analyzing the Series I Bond Composite Rate,"I have been trying to understand why the composite interest rate on the Series I bond is computed the way it is. For those who need a refresher, the composite interest rate is based on a formula involving a fixed interest rate and variable interest rate that floats is with rate of inflation and is reset every 6 months. 

Letting ""f"" be the fixed rate and ""v"" the variable rate, the formula is

composite rate = f + 2v + fv

Now, since we are doing semi-annual compounding, the first-period return on principle of $1000 would be 

$1000 x (1 + composite rate / 2)

It is this ""composite rate / 2"" that I'm curious about. After some algebra, you get

composite rate / 2 = f/2 + v(1 + f/2)

My interpretation is that ""f/2"" term is the interest you earn from the fixed portion of the rate in the first six months. ""v(1+f/2)"" represents the variable interest you ear in the first period *plus that amount compounded in the second six month period at the fixed rate f.*

The only reason I can think of for why they would create the composite interest this way is because in the second period, the variable interest rate changes, so you can only compute a compounded return using the fixed rate, which doesn't change. 

I have the following questions for the community.

1. does anybody else share this interpretation?
2. does anybody have an alternative interpretation or have any resources to share?

TLDR; what sort of consumption meter device(s) will work with my panel?

I have a new 26 x REC400 panel array with an Enphase central inverter.  My installer didn't offer to install consumption meters, and I didn't think to ask before joining this community.

Once I did join here and realized I'd love to see what we're using vs. the output of the system (albeit not much this time of year in NorCal), I purchased Enphase's CT-200-SPLIT meters while waiting for PG&amp;E's PTO and the final visit from the installer.

Received PTO a couple of days ago, and the installer came by today to collect the final payment.  I asked him if he/they could install the meters.

He opened up the panel and thought that these meters wouldn't work with my panel because they're designed to clip around feed wires, and my panel uses a different sort of configuration; the main service breaker is fed from a rail that can't be clipped around.

I'm wondering if there's a way to use these meters somehow or if there's a different set of devices I need to buy that will do the trick.

Thanks in advance.  I'm new to all of this!  :-)

I live in a HCOL area and my 2 bedroom condo costs 540k (recently renovated). I am putting down 20%, Interest rate is 3.75% fixed for 30 years based on a program through a local bank to promote homeownership in certain neighborhoods. My mortgage will be $2k/month, $300 condo fee (hopeful this will decrease once we can get rid of the property management company), insurance is about $500 annually and taxes will probably be $3,500-$4,000 once property is reassessed. My only other debt is my Honda CR V payment at $450/month (1.49% interest for 24 more months).

I have maxed out my 401k, HSA, Roth IRA for the past 4 years, but I know I won't be able to do that once I buy this condo. My company matches 7% plus an additional 10% of annual salary put in once a year. So my 7% contribution gets me 24% (I'm fully vested). I have \~3x my income saved in 401k/IRA at 33 years old, so I know I am ahead there especially with the market volatility this past year.

After closing, I will have about 40-50k split between investment account (\~30k), ibonds (10k) and cash(10k). I think my budget will be tight month to month, but when my bonus checks hit quarterly, it will allow me wiggle room. Does anyone have any tips that they use with a variable income?

economy,State Coincident Indexes - Not Looking Good,"One key economic metric that I watch for recession indication are the State Coincident Indexes put out by the Federal Reserve of Philadelphia (link below). They have deteriorated significantly over the last 4-6 months. Currently the values are in line with the economy being within 6 months of a recession based on past performance.

The coincident indexes combine four state-level indicators to summarize current economic conditions in a single statistic. The four state-level variables in each coincident index are nonfarm payroll employment, average hours worked in manufacturing by production workers, the unemployment rate, and wage and salary disbursements deflated by the consumer price index (U.S. city average). The trend for each state’s index is set to the trend of its gross domestic product (GDP), so long-term growth in the state’s index matches long-term growth in its GDP.

The imugr link below is the raw percentage of states with a positive month-over-month growth minus those with a negative growth over the entire timeframe covered by the Philadelphia Fed.

CryptoCurrency,Nexo's business model,"Good morning,

I really appreciate some good due diligence or a nice discussion but using out of context numbers and including a lot of doom doesn't make any substantial Analysis. It's just spreading fear and doubt. 

First of all, Nexo survived the 2018 bear market that was magnitudes worse. Furthermore Credissimo is a established bank that is related to Nexo. 

Now about the business model:

Nexo earns off spreads, provides liquidity and interest based on loans that are overcollateralized. Always been this way and worked very well. 

Interest rates start at 13-14% for loans and yield for stables top out at around 10%. There are some special offers with higher yields but Nexo is known for adjusting rates if needed. 

Nexo was always careful about regulation and has several registered licenses the countries they operate. European countries are not weak on regulation and if you want to operate there you have to comply why Nexo always did. In the US Nexo stopped their earning program due to regulatory uncertainty since Nexo is not chasing short term gains but wants to establish themself long term. 


Furthermore Nexo was a first mover of funds attestation (a real audit is planned). Nexo is not depended on several funding rounds and VC like others (FTX etc.) because they actually have an established business model and generate positive cash flows.

Here you can read more details about the business model explained in depth:

With a master in finance and a job as an analyst in one of the top 6 banks in Europe I can't stand  random shill or random doom without an extensive analysis. 

Lastly, I want to stress again i don't wanna shill Nexo and everyone that feels uneasy should withdraw their funds but let's have a discussion based on facts and not feelings.",cryptocurrency,1669704816

17. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue. In this case, it’s asserted that the lab behind the AMM didn’t even understand the extent of the problem due to a mismeasurement. Of course, the prospect of new DEXs with impermanent loss mitigation brings something new to the table.

41. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

45. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US.

90% sure Gov officials broke laws in helping FTX and SMF

80% sure the SEC was aware of what was going on and turned a blind eye.  

100% sure journalists have been instructed to push a narrative about SBF or FTX.

70% SBF will face no punishment and that will be accepted by 99% of the population. 

Consider it in these terms. SBF directly lied to customers and stole their money rather than operate a profitable risk free business taking fees so they could pull the biggest financial scam we have ever seen in broad daylight. His parents, mom the founder of a large political pact to which millions have been donated by SBF and his circle and his father ""*a well-connected professor at Stanford Law. While Fried was more involved in the political side of SBF’s operation, Bankman was heavily involved in the business itself, including helping to raise funds to finance the firm. Bankman is a leading* [*expert*](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.17310/ntj.2004.4.08) *on state and federal tax shelters, and some in the cryptocurrency space have speculated that he might have used his expertise to create the corporate structure (see below) of his son’s offshore financial firms.""* 

A house is also in their name which is suspicious regardless of how you look at it. They are experts in their fields, well connected to Gov officials and never even thought at any point something was going on. I don't care how you think this happened, I can promise you the two people that would know that this is something they would want to avoid even if they fully believed FTX was legit would be his parents. It's not like they only knew their son from how he was presented to the rest of the world. Looking at SBFs past interviews now and his outright refusal to answer what he's asked there is no way he parents weren't aware of what was going on. Caroline Ellison's father worked with Gensler when they both [taught at MIT.](https://news.mit.edu/2021/gary-gensler-nominated-chair-sec-0119) The majority of Maxine waters committee is compromised and involved with FTX and we are  just supposed to assume NONE of these high ranking people ever thought to insulate themselves in anyway? In the business world the entire executive team of large companies work very hard to not even give the appearance of wrongdoing even in situations they know nothing is going on. 

What's even crazier is the fact what FTX exploited just so happened to be something that we now know, knowledgeable people in finance or the crypto space knew was possible. What I mean is anyone who understood this could have designed specific steps to create a semi sustainable situation where FTX was essentially creating money out of thin air while inflating its value. Spending hundreds of millions on homes and donations. Oddly they were 'hacked' and the accounts emptied last minute. The New York Times is hosting SBF at their conference? These 13 or 20 kids in no way were capable of running this operation and in no way is it believable they could.

stocks,Margin interest rates are a scam,"When a broker charges you interest on your margin used, you are getting an extra hidden charge. 

Brokers have this tricky wording in their lending rates that allows them to charge more than their stated interest rate. 

Let’s look at Robinhood for example. They charge a “6.5% yearly interest rate calculated daily”. 

The key phrase here is “calculated daily”. This phrase allows them to charge you more than 6.5%! Now we have to factor in that they’re charging you daily (365 times).

Here’s the equation to calculate the effective interest rate: (1+6.5%/365)^365-1= 6.71%

Here we see the actual interest charged is 6.71% rather than 6.5%. 

All brokers use the same method of charging margin. 

This is the hidden cost of using margin! It applies to any APR lending, hence why APR stands for Annual Stated Rate. What they state vs what they actually charge you is completely different!",finance,1669723980

# [S&amp;P 500 futures rise as China Covid concerns ease](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/28/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Futures connected to the S&amp;P 500 rose Tuesday as worries over unrest in China and its Covid protocols appeared to ease.
*****
&gt; The broad index’s futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.4%. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near flat.
*****
&gt; The move follows stocks in Hong Kong and Shanghai rallying overnight as a Chinese official told reporters that 65.8% of people “over age 80” had received booster shots. On top of that, the government reported the first decline in Covid infections within mainland China in more than a week.
*****
&gt; Those updates follow the declines in U.S. and foreign markets seen Monday after protests in mainland China against the country’s zero-Covid policy started over the weekend. West Texas Intermediate crude futures briefly fell to their lowest point since last December while all three of the major U.S. indexes ended the day down more than 1% as investors grew increasingly concerned about if Chinese Covid protocols could hamper global supply chains.
*****
&gt; “There’s some real reasons to be cautious. The market’s rallied a lot this quarter, and there’s some concerns that things are going to slow, so I think it’s a kind of balanced risk reward,” Trivariate Research’s Adam Parker said Monday on CNBC’s “Closing Bell: Overtime.”
*****
&gt; “I think there was an excuse with maybe some China slowdown fears for people to collect a little profit that they made in the quarter,” he added.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders will watch for the September reading of the S&amp;P CoreLogic Case-Shiller Home Price Index that is due Tuesday before the bell. The report will give investors insight into how higher interest rates are affecting the housing market. Home prices in the prior month jumped about 13% year over year.
*****
&gt; Meanwhile, the latest reading on consumer confidence is set to release at 10 a.m. Wall Street is also expecting the latest corporate earnings results from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Tuesday after the bell.
*****
&gt; Fed Chair Jerome Powell is scheduled to speak at the Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy at Brookings on Wednesday. Investors will be listening for insight into the central bank’s fight against inflation.

personalfinance,Thoughts on tax brackets and Roth vs Traditional,"I just noticed that the [Federal tax brackets](https://www.irs.com/en/articles/2022-federal-income-tax-brackets-rates-standard-deductions) have a huge jump from 12%-22% at $41,775 taxable income (2022 tax year).

The pros/cons of Roth vs traditional get discussed a lot. Maybe I missed it, but this specific jump between brackets seems really significant: if I'm around that threshold now and saving well for retirement, I can't imagine that my relevant federal tax rate in retirement could be less than 12% (which seems amazingly low), but I can imagine it could be either more or less than 22%.

Given that, it seems like a good strategy around this taxable income level would be to contribute just enough to a traditional IRA/401k to get down into the 12% bracket, avoiding paying the 22% rate on that chunk of income. The rest would go to a Roth IRA/401k, where it definitely gets taxed at a low 12% rate now instead of whatever the tax rate in retirement is, and also benefits from the greater flexibility Roth accounts have.

*Edit: a caveat that was pointed out in the comments is that if a very high percent of your retirement savings are in Roth accounts--no traditional IRA/401k, no taxable investments, no pension--then your marginal tax rate in retirement could be under 12% or even zero. The Roth/Traditional logic above could result in 100% Roth if someone never breaks into the 22% bracket. So everybody should put enough money in Traditional accounts at some point in their career (preferably a high-earning phase) so that they reasonably expect a 12% marginal tax rate in retirement. Assuming you do that, I believe my strategy is still sound.*

If you firmly believe that your tax rate in retirement will be above 22%, then this calculation is irrelevant and you should just do 100% Roth. For people not in that category...am I missing something?

Also, does anyone know why there are such big breaks in marginal tax rates (12%-22%, and 24-32%) surrounded by smaller jumps? Seems weird to me.",finance,1669731484

Bitcoin,Was Bitcoin attacked through Sam Bankman Fried (FTX)...?,"Hello

So there are theories floating around that the FTX fiasco and SBF (Sam Bankman Fried or whatever the name of that crook is) was a form of attack (from the STATE (FED whatever)) on Bitcoin...?

Are there some well thought out articles on this issue giving a deep dive into it...? Is it possible...?

Lets not forget that BTC acted quite INCREDIBLY WEIRD this last cycle.... 

1) 1st we got only a POOR top at 64K (69K if you wish), like WTF is that... Thats pathethic for BTC...

2) We got basically a double TOP (!?)... Again, this has NEVER happened in the decade+ long history of BTC... NEVER...

3) We got almost a typical bear market bottom (-77,5%) or whatever... Thats almost up there with the depths of previous bear markets... SO the depth of the bottom is almost typical, WITHOUT the top being typical (we got LOW/POOR top, but got (almost) regularly deep BOTTOM)...

Like im sorry, but all this doesnt seem normal at all for me, and than we got the FTX fiasco with all the weird things around it...

CryptoCurrency,Trust-Minimizing Proof of Solvency &amp; Safe Cex Requirements,"**Wall of text incoming.**

What I hope to achieve is increased public awareness of what it is people **need** to demand from exchanges in order for FTX-esque rugpulls to be a thing of the past.
At the same time I'll propose something of a solution/requirements needed to be fulfilled to mitigate the issues identified. 

After the latest centralised exchange debacle the call for exchanges to provide a proof of solvency has become too loud for them to ignore. We haven't seen customer trust fall this low since Mt. Gox fell through.  
However every single one of the ""proof of reserves"" currently implemented by exchanges leave too much to be desired: with the most glaring fault of all being that you must **trust** that the data provided by the exchange to the auditing party is not manipulated. Furthermore the timegap between audits makes it possible for exchanges to, amongst other things, send funds around in a circle to prove ""solvency"" at the time of the audit without actually being solvent. 

**If this is the end result of the current outrage it will have solved nothing**, as the current implementations of proof of reserves/solvency do not prove what they are supposed to prove: that the exchange is solvent. And not just at snapshot moment X and/or relying on valuation of token Y for solvency but that they have not touched customers funds without permission and that if a customer wishes to, their funds are actually available for withdrawal.

How do you go about solving this? Vitalik &amp; Cz have publicly announced a collaboration but as that might take an unknown amount of time and the outcome of an exchange creating a mechanism that is supposed to prove it's own trustworthyness is not exactly optimal I think everybody would benefit from a public discussion about possible solutions.  

#**Issue at hand**: 
To ensure an exchange is solvent you need a client list, holdings per client and a list of the wallets that these funds are being held on. In addition to this you need a full disclosure of exchange liabilities and assets both onchain and offchain.

Whilst this sounds relatively simple there are a few core issues that have to be tackled here:

#**-P1.You want to make sure that the data that is supposed to prove the solvency of the exchange is not potentially manipulated by the exchange before an auditor gets to see it.**



#**-P2.You want to preserve client privacy whilst reducing time between audits to a minimum.**



#**-P3.You want to ensure the solvency part does not include ""weird"" things(recent examples are FTT/FTX, Luna, Celsius).**



#**P1.**
I think this is the biggest and most difficult part of a potential solution. Ensuring the data has not been corrupted at the source. 

This also means you cannot just call on an API provided by or in control of the exchange as this means you are relying on this information provided by them to be truthful and trustworthy. Not to mention it could be manipulated to give different outputs depending on the requesting party. If you need to trust the exchange to be providing trustworthy information for your version of proof of reserves to work it is inherently flawed and you might aswell not have it as it doesn't prove what it is supposed to.

This is why Nexo's implementation for example is terrible and can't be trusted as a real proof of reserves: Armanino(auditor) can give an attestation that the data provided by Nexo's API shows X, that does not mean that the data provided to the API is truthful, nor that it isn't relying on their own printed token being able to be sold for $X to maintain solvency. https://twitter.com/rue_du_coin/status/1591815867570044931

Likewise Binance's proof of reserves: as it currently stands, realistically it doesn't prove anything. They're published by the one supposedly being audited. Merkle trees are great, but unless they're implemented correctly they're no different than an exchange saying ""just trust us"". https://twitter.com/jespow/status/1596227031637045248?

Some other quick examples; 


Gemini's trust center: Does not prove anything. They ask the customers to trust them that they have their assets. 



Kraken's Proof of solvency: best one so far but still lacking. Amongst other things: the time between audits takes too long so it cannot prevent exchanges playing hot potato with funds. Furthermore there is no way to prove as a customer that the exchange is being untruthful if they decide to lower your balance before it is submitted to an auditor. The audit might show that your balance is lower than what you think it should be but there is no way to prove for you as a client that you did not give permission for a trade to have been executed that might have resulted in this subsequent loss of funds.



If merkle trees are required: Armanino, Mazars and KPMG all offer merkle tree proof of reserves. Using not one but multiple auditors increases confidence in the accuracy of the data output from these parties. 


Ideally you would want to use multiple API's provided by multiple independent auditors and aggregate this data to ensure both the data provided to- aswell as the outcome of the audits themselves match. This ensures an exchange cannot alter the data depending on the requestor of the data, as they have no control over these outputs. To aggregate this data you would make use of a decentralised oracle solution. **This is only part of the solution though.**


To make this work you need a system of checks on these balances provided by the exchange to the auditors. A distinction must be made publically between assets of the exchange and assets of clients of the exchange that the exchange is currently holding. These two shouldn't be mixed up and equalised in a non-transparent way to be equal to a specific value in $. With this you could get shenanigens like equalizing a clients funds to $X and swapping their actual holdings for an equivalent of $X valued in exchange token K. Continued after introduction of***[2]***;



#**P2.**


Speaks for itself. Can be achieved through the use of merkle trees. 


However: as I'm personally not an expert on the ins-outs and all possible restrictions/exploitations of merkle trees and their implementations and more importantly I believe the best solution***[2]*** as far as on-chain solvency goes has as much transparency as possible whilst preserving client privacy I'll propose an alternative ""dumb-processing"" solution: 


As KYC is forced practically on all CEX's with liquidity these days: 
Give every client a unique identifier. This identifier(q) is only shared with the auditors and the client in question. 

Split the balance of every client between multiple, unique, anonymous ID(a)'s. Only give the information of which combination of ID(a)'s make out the balance of a specific client to this client and the auditors. The total amount of all these pseudo-anonymous ID's combined should be the bare minimum of funds contained in the wallets an exchange claims as theirs. This way you can preserve client privacy whilst making the entirety of client holdings public. The split of funds per client per ID and the ID's themselves should be randomized every snapshot to prevent external parties from being able to gain information about specific clients or their trades from these balances. 

(Possibly forcing token/coin dust below a certain value to get unique ID's seperate from the other parts of a clients balance might be a way to prevent unique dust combinations disclosing more information than required. Might have to exclude dust below a certain value entirely(The client name, other than the unique identifier(q) tied to the account, would preferrably be encrypted before sending it over to the auditor to prevent an auditor leak from leaking client names+holdings)). 


Make the exchange publically push a list of this information on chain at the same time as it is sent to auditors. (this information being all ID(a)'s and their respective balances)
After the auditors publish the version of this information they received from the exchange it guarantees the information the auditors got/are getting is the same as the information publically disclosed.
The auditors can verify no clients have the same ID's and no funds are allocated more than once. 


In addition to this you would use a 2FA system, that changes code every X seconds that also keeps a history list of previously generated codes. Once again, it is vital that this is outside the exchanges control. 


Every single trade executed by a client would have to be approved by a 2FA code. Doing this would ensure that the data presented by the exchange is truthful as otherwise they can be proven to be lying on short notice:


**Scenario 1: Exchange lies to both the auditor(s) and the client:**


The exchange lies to both the auditor and customer, reducing the amount of funds the customer has or is supposed to have(or even simply changing them even if the value at moment X is supposed to be equal; XETH swapped for XFTT would be an example), the customer can find in the logs that the exchange has pushed onchain when this happened. The customer can than request proof that permission has been given to execute this trade by requesting the exchange to verify the 2FA code that was supposedly used to grant permission for the trade with a third party: once again a decentralised oracle solution would be preferred to perform these checks and validations to ensure fairness, making use of zero knowledge proofs to prevent the exchange from ever learning what the actual code was). The exchange would not have the correct 2FA code as the customer never entered it. The exchange is proven to have been lying. An accompanying smart contract can trigger a circuitbreaker: either halting all trades/deposits/withdrawals or doing something previously agreed upon. (Might want to use on-chain storage for an (encrypted) history list of generated codes.)




**Scenario 2: Exchange lies to 1 party**


If the exchange lies to only the client(s) or only the auditors by providing them with faked data the discrepancy between the data received&amp;published by the auditors and the data pushed onchain by the exchange would become immediately visible, once again allowing a circuit breaker to be triggered. 




#**P3.**



To ensure this you need to publicize what the exchange puts on the assets part of the equation. If the clients are not happy with this they can withdraw: if FTX had clearly shown it was reliant on FTT being $X to remain solvent I imagine the gap in their balance would have been noticed a lot sooner and the damage could have been a lot smaller. This can be a problem for yield farming/lending services that are leveraged: they can be stop-loss hunted to force liquidations. For an exchange that shouldn't be touching a clients funds without permission in the first place this shouldn't be a problem.

Things like throwing negative balances into the mix when using merkle trees to make up for missing client funds also becomes impossible with this model as everyone can see that the exchange has included an ID with a negative balance in their publically visible list, even before the auditors even come into play.

Once again, a smartcontract based circuitbreaker can come into play here by freezing all withdrawals/deposits/trades when #clientfundsdeposited/held&lt;#clientfundsheldonexchangewallets. How fast this is will be depending on how often the lists are updated, however as soon as they're updated and shown to be uncercollaterised a full stop can be triggered minimizing the damage done.

Last it is not possible to completely, 100% mathematically, trustlessly prove off&amp;onchain solvency due to the nature of offchain debts and possibility to simply not disclose part of them to an auditor. It is fraudulent but something being illegal does not make it impossible. This can be mitigated by making it illegal for debtors demand client funds or exchanges to pay debts/secure loans using client funds. This means either new laws have to be written or the interpretation of certain laws need to be broadened, depending on the country the exchange is active in. This would ensure however that in case of a bankruptcy the clients are minimally impacted.

Ideally you would want a real time check being possible at all times of assets and liabilities. Onchain this is possible, offchain this is much more difficult. This is part of the reason why you would want to try to bring offchain liabilities onchain.

External Offchain liability verifications (not tokenized debts to banks for example) are a bit more difficult and I think a periodic checkup by multiple independent auditing firms is as good as it's going to get.

In the time between these audits, as expecting a full off-chain debt analysis audit to be proven every 10 minutes or so is currently not feasible, we should be doing and expecting what can be done: ensuring the on-chain collateral matches what is owed to the clients. Even if there are external offchain debts(to not-clients), as long as there is a legally binding agreement that making clients whole always precedes repayment of these debts, proving the onchain collateral will take us very far into the direction of where we would ideally want to be, as customers of cex's. 


I'm not sure whether to call this a model of dual or triple proofs as every single part, the multiple auditors, the onchain public publication seperate from these auditors, the possibility of 2FA check on every trade executed and using a decentralised oracle network to aggregate data&amp;perform external checks is born out of necessity to minimize the chance of fraud by exchanges going unseen until suddenly the gap in their balance sheet is in the billions. Perhaps a part of the 2FA checks and or comparing the list published by the exchange to the list available from the auditors should be automated to be less reliant on customers actually checking these things themselves. 

A weakness in this system without this would be that it is relying on customers to actually check every so often whether their balances have not been altered without their permission. By not directly reducing the current market value in fiat of a customers account but by swapping their holdings in the audit for an illiquid token valued at $X a customer wouldn't necessary have to notice it without checking the publicized lists themselves. If none of the customers do this, changes to their balances without their permission could go unnoticed. Making the rest of the system irrelevant as we would be back to step 1: ensuring that the data that is audited and compared to detect fraud has not been falsified. 


For all these checks and aggregations a decentralised oracle network is needed. There is no point in going through all the effort of implementing these checks if they are relying on a single point of failure; an oracle that can be manipulated or lied to. As chainlink is currently with leaps and bounds the #1 decentralised oracle provider, working together with their team to implement a system like this would be the logical thing to do. Once again: aggregating the information from the multiple auditors and comparing it to the information published by the exchange itself and the 2FA ""truth-authentication"" checks should all be done through a decentralised oracle service to prevent singular points of trust and therefore becoming exploitable. Whilst you could use it to put the part of the information gained directly from the exchange onchain aswell I think it would be unnecessary as letting the exchange do this themselves would amount to the same: they can't lie without being found out. 
(I""ll refer to the data directly put onchain by the exchange as E1 and the data aggregated from the auditors as A1 from now on).



#**Concluding** 

With these implementations we have finally gotten to the true value Proof of Reserves can add: checking at small time intervals whether the datasheets A1 and E1 match. Preferrably even comparing the submitted 2FA auth. codes from the exchanges perspective to what they're suppose to be(zero knowledge proofs). 

In case A1/E1 do not match with either the 2FA codes and/or eachother an automated action can be set in motion. Whether this be automatic withdrawal of client funds to wallets whitelisted by clients in advance or triggering a full deposit/withdrawal/trading stop or something else entirely. A yearly or quaterly auditor would not save your funds as a client without this as FTX has once again clearly demonstrated: they were solvent according to their auditors in 2020 and 2021. 

There will be some timelag between a funds-gap coming into being and it becoming public as doing the encryption for these lists, being fed through both the auditors systems and being published on chain, then having the data be aggregated and compared can't be instant. However with this model we can decrease the time between audits to a time amount that is currently unfeasible; even if it only were to happen once every couple of hours it would make it incredibly hard and/or exceedingly obvious for exchanges to play hot potato with funds(or lack thereof). This would do away with a possible need for time-equalised snapshots between exchanges. 

**This would guarantee solvency not just at the moment of the audit, once a year or so, but solvency around the clock.** Which is exactly what you would want from a proof of solvency: a guarantee that you have not been bamboozled out of your holdings. 




I won't go into the exact technical details behind a possible implementation (https calls, Api implementations and so on ); I'll leave it to vitalik/link&amp;co to figure it out and implement it. If you want to read more about this topic itself there's a paper that goes a bit deeper into the current issues with proof of solvency you can find here; Broken Proofs of Solvency in Blockchain Custodial Wallets and Exchanges : https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/043.pdf (I would always recommend looking up the paper yourself to prevent possible pdf exploits). 

#**TL:DR; The True value of Proof of Reserves is not just proving that at moment X company Y is solvent. FTX was solvent in 2020 and 2021 according to their auditors.**

The true value lies in guaranteeing that at any which moment in real-time company Y becomes either insolvent or seemingly insolvent you can safeguard the vast majority of client funds. This is achieved by building in a smartcontract with a circuit breaker that can do multiple things; withdraw client funds to an adress that client has whitelisted in advance, stop all trades/deposits/withdrawals or something else entirely with the end result being safeguarding the funds of clients held by an exchange as much as possible. A yearly or quarterly audit would not save your funds as a client without this. In order for a circuit breaker such as this to be triggered, regardless of circumstances, a third party, decentralised oracle solution is required. Through these oracles at the very least the off-chain liabilities of an exchange in the form of what they owe to their clients that have funds deposited with them, need to be brought onchain/be made transparent to this network. 

This guarantees that if the company ever becomes unable to pay the clients what they are owed, even if only by a tiny fraction, the damage is minimized. In order to do this and guarantee it works when it needs to work you need to bring these off-chain liabilities(clients&amp;what they are owed) onchain.



None of the current implementations exchanges use guarantee solvency around the clock without relying on the proven to be unreliable words ""trust us"". All of their current implementations do nothing for you as a client as solvency at one specific moment, without further declaring liabilities and so on is meaningless. 


As a client you need to keep in mind that even with a system such as the one outlined above implemented you are still responsible for your owns funds. If you accept a company using their own token as collateral to stay solvent you are sabotaging yourself. Accepting this could very well mean an exchange can circumvent all the safeguards above, depending on the implementation of the system in place. As we've seen time and time again, most recently with FTX,Luna,Celsius: trusting an exchange to stay solvent based on the valuation of their own token has proven not to be a great idea. The system outlined above would only expose it being done.",cryptocurrency,1669735626

personalfinance,UPDATE: We're supposed to go to closing on the new house in 36 hours and we still don't have a closing disclosure,"Sorry this update is so late, but here it is:

In my first [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/oj60qe/were_supposed_to_go_to_closing_on_the_new_house/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3), I was worried that my partner and I weren't going to get our new home loan. There's a (USA) Federal regulation that says the Closing Disclosure must be issued 3 business days before the Act of Sale. But when I wrote the post, the act of sale was only 36 hours away, we still hadn't gotten the CD, and I was getting paranoid. A lot happened since then, so here's an update.

The act of sale was scheduled for 9am on Wednesday morning at the title company that my agent recommended. I finally got paperwork labeled ""Final Closing Disclosure"" from my Loan Processor with 24 hours to go. (Spoiler: it's wasn't ""final."") At the same time, my real estate agent got a call from the title company.

The loan processor had contacted the title company Tuesday morning, and said the we needed to push closing back to Friday morning. The processor took this step on her own, without contacting me, the sellers, or our agents. My real estate agent said that was totally inappropriate, and was livid.

(Later I got to see email exchanges where my agent basically ripped the processor a new one, which made my day. I never liked the loan processor, ever since she told me ""I'm the person who decides if your loan goes to underwriting or not,"" in a very condescending tone of voice.)

Hours of hectic confusion ensued. We were told that we had to close on Friday because of the 3-day rule concerning the Closing Disclosure. But we couldn't close on Friday because the sellers were hoping on a plane on Wednesday afternoon. (And my partner wouldn't be able to take Friday off of work, anyway.) The CD was incomplete, plus had an $8,000 error. My partner and I were fielding emails, phone calls, and text messages between the involved parties. While at the same time I'm driving my partner across town for their job and squinting at a pdf file on my phone.

What was finally proposed was a ""dry closing."" Everyone would show up at the title company on Wednesday morning, sign over the cashier's checks and deposits, and sign paperwork that was dated for Friday. Then the title company would hold on to the money until Friday, when the act of sale would actually be processed and money wired to the sellers.

We were very uncomfortable with this. But we were assured that we would leave the office Wednesday morning with the keys and a post-dated Cash Sale contract in hand. And our agent (who's been working with us for 5 months and has been freaking awesome,) said she's done dry closings before, and that she completely trusted the title company. We finally agreed to the dry closing on Wednesday.

About an hour later, I'm in a meeting at work with my boss. I had told the mortgage company about their $8k error, and thought I was waiting for corrected paperwork. Instead, they start blowing up my phone! I finally took one of the calls, and told the loan officer (who is supposed to manage the loan processor's work,) that I'm busy and I'll call him back soon. When I finally do, he tells me that I need to sign the Closing Disclosure. I remind him of the $8,000 error, but he said that I needed to acknowledge receipt of it before they can fix it. (????!) And that I need to do that within the hour or they can't schedule the wire for Friday.

I signed it, but only because the $8k error was in my favor, and said I would be getting a refund upon closing. (Lol!) It turns out that the loan processor had whipped the CD together really quick just so I had something to sign, and hadn't even asked the title company to start reconciliation yet. Later that afternoon I got an updated CD, this time with an error in prorated property taxes that I had to ask them to correct. Finally at 4:55 pm on Tuesday, the title company reached out to me and asked if the loan processor had sent the final (for real now) Closing Disclosure. She hadn't, of course, so the title company sent it to me. This version matched the numbers I was expecting to the penny, and I finally started to relax.

The rest of the story is anticlimactic. After triple checking the numbers with the title company Wednesday morning, I got the last cashier's check, and we were done signing by 10:45am. The owners' gave us their blessing to start moving in immediately, even though we technically didn't own the place until Friday. We hugged the real estate agent, and made some brag posts on FB.

A note on some of the comments on the first post. Some people said, ""Don't worry, you'll close on time even if the CD is late."" Other people said that there was no way we could close on Wednesday. Looks like everyone was right. The dry closing was a way to work around the 3-day rule. Which was fine for us, but it seems to make a mockery of the intent to give the buyer 72 hours to review the paperwork.

There was also some confusion in the comments about the closing disclosure itself. All I can say is, it sucks when the average joe has to deal with industry lingo. The Loan Estimates I was given were labeled ""Initial Disclosures"" in the edocs system, but never said that in the paperwork itself. And some mortgage companies call a loan estimate a ""Preliminary Disclosure,"" and I don't know if that makes a difference. And most confusing of all, my ""Final"" Closing Disclosure was not a final disclosure, but was actually the third-to-last draft of the disclosure. So again, it looks like everyone was right....?

stocks,Value Vs Growth in the next 5-10,"I think we are definitely in a new business cycle. However, I thought that at the start of the pandemic, which just seemed to accelerate the same trajectory we were on since the great recession: significant growth in tech, value stocks completely out matched by +20% y-o-y gains, the fed pumping the economy up with cash, crypto, etc. etc...

Now? I think growth stocks will struggle to return the same as value in the next 5 to 10 years. Fed has become hawkish to fight inflation, which will cool lending and slow down all things growth oriented. Second, I'm not convinced inflation will completely dissipate in the next 1-2 years like everyone in the news media seems to think. Sticky CPI seems to be on a completely upward trajectory, without a breakpoint. This has me thinking: it's time to move to more blue-chip, value oriented etf/stocks/mutual funds.

personalfinance,Mortgage Forebearance turned into 61k Lien. Is that trouble?,"Long story short... Covid forebearance offered by the bank for 12 months before they started collecting payments. Inflation, baby, life got in the way. Eventually we were 10k behind. Worlds smallest violin playing in background yada yada yada.  


After back and forth with bank for several months, they left us option of restructuring our loan (I originally got in with a 2.75% interest rate) which would up us from 2.75%, to a 6.9% interest rate, upping our mortgage rate about $170 more a month moving forwards. Which is whatever considering foreclosure is the alternative, but the kicker is this..  


They used a MRNA Combo (0% non interest lien due when property is sold, modified, or paid off) from the gov't of 61 THOUSAND DOLLARS against my mortgage. So if I wanted to sell next year, or 10 years from now, I would have to come up with that at the time of the sale.  


Deets: bought my house around 200k, its value went up a bit cause of the boom, prob like 250k now. Half acre, 1000 square foot home, fenced in yard nothing too special. We want to upgrade at some point but that would be 5+ years from now.  


What I want to know is... will that 61k be a problem when we attempt to sell later on? Will that most likely just come out of the sale and we would be good? Or am I making a huge mistake when I sign the documents over?  


A little advice would go a long way for this frugal first time dad who just wants to keep a house over his family's head, but not ruin our future.

With the possible future introduction of CBDCs, do you think those in power would push these government shit coins to the public, all while claiming Bitcoin is dead/inferior, etc. but secretly stockpiling cheap Bitcoin?

We've come to see how slimy these fuckers like Klaus Schwab can be. I can see the government officials spreading FUD about Bitcoin, making the average joe second-guess it, sell it for CBDCs, driving BTC's price down, and allowing higher-ups to pick up more of it for cheap. 

Think about history - in 1933 the Federal Reserve called for Americans to give up their honest money (gold) for fiat shit (US dollars) while the Fed hoarded more and more sound, hard money (gold), giving them more power. They can't necessarily do that with Bitcoin, but they could try to part people with their BTC through FUD, misinformation, MSM propaganda, etc.

Then, when those in power have sufficient BTC, they switch their stance and make BTC legal tender, maybe the preferred tender, and now the average joe has to pay a fortune for a small amount of sats.

The excavator can generate 33.36/hr after paying the operator x 8hr = $266 /day = $1,334 /week = $5,337 /month - Assume it works 80% of the month = $4,270 - Estimate of maintenance $500 /month = $3,770

This got me thinking about my future. Just like most people, I eventually want to buy a house and have started saving. I currently have two lines of credit, a credit card, and student loans, which I was paying on but I have since paused payments because they have been accepted by the Biden student loan forgiveness and I’m just waiting to see what happens with that. My credit standing is good. 

So here’s my situation (Male in early 20’s). I currently have reliable transportation and don’t need an auto loan right now. However, I live in the mountains and use snowmobiling for fun and sometimes work. Would it be a bad idea to finance a new snowmobile to build a line of credit? I have enough capital to afford a new snowmobile, but I am just wondering if this is a stupid early 20’s decision.

personalfinance,Paying off Mortgage vs Investing,"Living in Canada.

My girlfriend and I both own our own homes, and have had an offer accepted for a home we'd be purchasing together. We'll both be selling our own homes to finance this joint purchase.

To put some numbers to things:

* Purchase price of new home: $530,000
* Minimum down-payment is then 20% of this: $106,000
* 5-year fixed interest rate: ~4.5% (depending how much we put down)
* Total available cash on hand after all fees paid on the sale of our homes and fees on purchase of new home: ~$180,000 available for down-payment ($106k minimum).

The question becomes, is it better to?

A) Put the full $180k down on the home?

B) Put down only 20% ($106k) and invest the remaining $74k right from the start.

It seems to me that option B is going to be the better overall route. Assuming biweekly payments of $1,100 for option B, and approximately $900 biweekly for A leaves $200 every two weeks that can also be thrown into investments over time, but the large initial available investment from option B seems like it will be the better choice...

I've always read that it's better to pay off debt first and foremost with, perhaps, the exception of student loans.

**Here are some details on my situation:**

* I have **$3K in medical debt**, with a moderate interest rate
* I have **$15K in credit card debt,** with a moderate interest rate (due to consolidation loan)
* I have **$12K in student loans**, with a low interest rate
* I have no savings at 30 years old
* I will be receiving **$30K** as a family gift

**My main question is then:** Is the obvious choice to pay off my debt? If so, **which of those debts** should I pay off? Or, do I continue to make payments on my debt and put the gift in savings?

Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm really not very financially literate. Thank you!

EDIT for details:

* For tax purposes, my family is splitting the gift into two checks of $15K -- one for the end of this year and one fore the beginning of next
* The student loan is federal
* I guess the credit card debt is actually just a loan - with an interest rate of 11.75%
* I actually don't know the interest rate for the medical debt
* I do have a steady career and make $80K before taxes",finance,1669757765
CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Fed rate hikes in 2022: Smaller bump in Dec? What it will mean...,"tl;dr ||Federal interest rates are key to the next bull run. Investment in crypto markets got pulled pretty heavily with I-bonds promising huge \*guaranteed\* returns. When those investment opportunities dry up, capital will flood back into the crypto market. And the run will be on. Jerome Powell is your god now. Pray for his mercy and blessings to be upon you.||

The Fed raising rates has been hell on crypto this year. The major price fall in May? Right as the Fed announced their intentions to seriously increase interest rates this year. And prices for crypto have been turbulent around every scheduled Fed meeting since.

Personally, I think it's pretty clear that since the May meeting, crypto prices dropped before each Fed meeting in anticipation that whatever news was delivered would have a similar impact as the disaster in May, but crypto prices have fallen too far and despite each meeting resulting in a .75% increase in interest rates, crypto prices recover shortly after. The price on the day of the meeting had the worst expected outcome already baked in, so there wasn't any added downward pressure when the announcement hit.

So, with another Fed meeting around the corner what can we expect?

Well, if it's the same as the last several, prices will have a modest drop in the week leading up to and then immediately come back up within a few days after. But this meeting is slightly different. The Fed Chair has signaled that while there will likely be another rate hike this time around, it probably won't be as much as the last four. We knew what was coming during the last several meetings and crypto prices braced for impact in the week leading up.

This time could catch the market off guard. If they go back on their intentions and hit us with another .75% increase, while the market expected .25-.5%, there could be a shock day of. Alternatively, prices today could already be pessimistic about the meeting and a small bump to the interest rate might check out as good news and send prices up a bit.

The real question is: how are inflation/job openings through Nov? If inflation is still high and jobs are still not getting filled, expect a modestly bad day for the crypto market. If inflation has moderated significantly and employers aren't having such a hard time getting workers, it could be a really good day.

  So I realized a few days ago that Federal taxes are no longer being taken out of my paycheck. My HR dept / Payroll processor says that they are following IRS guidelines and that I can send a percentage more of my paycheck to Fed taxes if I want, but I don't think I should have to...I never have before. I claim 2 exemptions.  We have a 'sample paycheck' option in our payroll system that shows what our check would be if we tweak our tax setup, and I see that if I set it to 0 exemptions then it does take out a couple hundred for Federal taxes, but at 2 exemptions that drops to 0. Note they are still taking out State taxes (California). So when tax time rolls around, I get the $2K per child (2) for the child tax credit, but a big chunk of that is having to go to pay the missing Federal tax. When I use the [IRS tax calculator](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/tax-withholding-estimator) it shows that I will owe something like $400 next year.

I file Married filing Jointly - my wife doesn't have a job and I have no other jobs.

I am not marked as Exempt in the payroll system.

This all seems to have started when they changed the withholding form a couple of years ago.

4) initial plan was to pay student loans off aggressively (after paying off other things I need to pay for in order to stay alive, the remainder of my paycheck all goes to student loans) 
5) monthly expense is around 1k because I live at home and split bills with parent, who has agreed that I should live with them to save money on rent. No current plans to move out yet, but if I do, monthly expense will likely triple since I live in a HCOL area
6) no retirement saved yet in terms of 401k, Roth IRA, and the likes. I’m debating between pushing retirement savings off to pay loans off aggressively (see 4) and prioritizing maxing out retirement savings 

I made a similar post in r/studentloans, and was advised to post here as well, so here I am. 

Any advice is appreciated. TIA!!",finance,1669777503

personalfinance,First Time Home Buyer,"First time home buyer here. Looking to buy in San Diego CA in Clairemont, which is a desirable neighborhood that is very central and close to the bay.

Our situation:
- Unmarried couple (not married for personal reasons). We’ve been together for a decade and has and have lived together for 7 years. I’m not worried about her “screwing me”. I’m more interested in how that might affect the buying process.
- We make $230k gross. $12.8k monthly net. 
- We also make bonuses, but I’m pretending they don’t exist in this calculation. But that’s another solid $20k net a year at least. 
- We have $240k in savings. No debt.
- Our monthly expenses (excluding rent) are $2k. 
- The going rate for acceptable homes in the area are $875k-$950k. We are shooting for $900k. 

Assumptions:
- $900k w/ 20% down = $180k down 
- Interest: 6.5%
- Tax rate: 1.1%
- Insurance: $2,500/yr
- Closing costs: $25k 

With all of those assumptions, our mortgage would be $5.6k. With expenses, our COL would be $7.6k. That would leave us with $5.2k a month leftover for investments/savings/life. And we would have $35k leftover in savings after the transaction if my closing costs assumptions are correct (which is roughly a 4 month emergency fund; and we would aggressively save that extra ~$5k/mo to build our reserves up as fast as possible). But going from $240k to $35k is scary lol so I’m just trying to account for as much as i reasonably can

Questions:
- Taxes: Googling tells me the SD tax rate is 0.73%. But from a friend I know who owns a house, and other posts I’ve seen from homeowners who live in the area… they pay closer go 1%-1.2%; so what am I missing here?

- Insurance: this is a guess and I obviously don’t know until I get a quote. But I don’t know if this translates linearly from sticker price vs dwelling replacement cost. Am I overeating this? Or possibly even underestimating this?

- Closing costs: Google is telling me that closing costs are 2%-5% on average of purchase price. I assumed 3% here and came to roughly $25k. But again, something tells me this doesn’t translate 1:1 in HCOL areas purely based on high purchase prices. Am I overestimating these costs? Am I underestimating them…? 

- Interest rate: I know that no one has a crystal ball here. My FICO 2 score for Experian is 690, my girlfriend is in the high 700s. Is 6.5 a safe rate to assume right here right now? Do you think it’s better to buy down the rate with points if we can? Or wait a few years hoping rates go down and refinance?

- Maintenance: The rule of thumb seems to be to save 1% of your monthly payment to account for maintenance/repairs - which would be another -$560 a month. But again, that guideline seems to be based around a general average. I’m not looking to buy a mansion here. It’s a normal house. So $6.7k a year, every year, seems pretty inflated. HVAC and water heaters only cost so much, regardless of sticker price… am I missing something here? 

So what are your thoughts? About my assumptions? About our finances? If you think “absolutely, you should buy now”, if you think “hell no, you should not buy now”… I want to hear it all.

I know this was a relatively long post but I’m trying to do my due diligence here, so I appreciate anyone willing to give me their honest opinions here.",finance,1669782948
personalfinance,Help! Debt is approaching,"Any tips are much appreciated! As mentioned above I’m struggling to budget well while entering my student loan repayment and don’t know what to do to begin working towards being debt free

I recently downloaded rocketmoney and synced my credit card, loans, and bank accounts into a budget. 

I’m 6 months into a federal fellowship program with a starting salary of 46k/ year, I have 5 months until a salary promotion to 55.5k/ year, and finish the program in 1.5 years with a final raise to 68k.

I make around 1250 biweekly and have a line of credit for 10,000, with a card balance of 2,500. As well as a 747 credit score.

My bills without factoring in student loans are around 900/month.

My main reason for posting is that I have 86k in student loans that I have to start paying end of December and am not sure if I can afford the 1000 monthly payments, want to defer, or want to refinance

I have been trying to refinance but have had issues getting a loan with my debt:income ratio being so high. My father had agreed to co-sign on new applications but don’t really know where to start

12. There’s trouble in DeFi land as it’s pointed out once again that LPing in AMMs seems to very frequently involve impermanent losses outpacing fee revenue.

CryptoCurrency,Create your own official MOONs Airdrop | Step by Step guide,"Everybody likes airdrops of popular coins. And we on Reddit love free Moons. If you ever wanted to give love to your fellow redditors, there is an official and easy way how to do mass tipping.

https://preview.redd.it/6jxei6ble23a1.jpg?width=332&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1b4684a72408bb4d4a577e0ff06eb1081dc29bda

 **What you will need:**

1. MOONs - Most of you will earn Moons on reddit, or you can buy them. You are not FED or Tether, so you can't print from thin air.
2. Some ETH for gas
3. Importing/ creating the crypto address where you have your Moons + Eth in supported wallet.
4. Telegram app

Let's get into more details:

**Point 1.** is obvious. You can't give what you don't have. Get some MOON on RCP Swap, MEXC, Sushiswap or earn directly on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com//r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki#wiki_earning_moons)

**Point 2.** both Moons and Ethereum should be on Arbitrum Nova chain. Moons in your Reddit Vault are on that chain already, so no hassle here. Arbitrum Nova has very low gas fees. For the start, you will be doing one or two transactions of the moons so it will be \~0.0001 ETH in fees.Thanks to the [u/hashzzz](https://www.reddit.com/u/hashzzz/) and [u/prussia\_dev](https://www.reddit.com/u/prussia_dev/) you can get your arbitrum nova ETH on [novafaucet.com](https://novafaucet.com/). If you're big fish, please donate some nova eth to the faucet so plankton users can live. You know, it's closed ecosystem. When plankton dies, so do the small fish and eventually the big ones too.

**Point 3.** for now, we can't send Moons directly from our reddit vault outside. Let's say, you have all your Moons in Reddit Vault. *Copy your reddit vault seed phrase*. You will need wallet app that supports Arbitrum Nova chain. Metamask or Math Wallet are good options. I will use Math Wallet android app for this guide.

*- download the app, open, agree with terms- Choose Arbitrum Nova Blockchain*

[chain](https://preview.redd.it/0u432b62f23a1.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d682c0a831079627ef1038b173adf145d0adcec)

  *- Import wallet - Import by Mnemonic - paste your reddit vault seed phrase, Set Wallet Name and create password for it - click Import Wallet.* 

[import](https://preview.redd.it/ipm46d89f23a1.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e93de5baa91bf630a4abbdf82cba94c2ca401ce4)

 Your ETH will appear in Assets. 

[eth in wallet](https://preview.redd.it/5ad373uef23a1.jpg?width=576&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e9d068b1fb788860c9f28e0c589b944b253fa43a)

 MOON token needs to be added as custom asset.*- click on 3 dots in upper right corner - Add Assets*

[add assets](https://preview.redd.it/1oqidimlf23a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=58fbedcb3118f6ccae31a465afc3d501cbeb90ca)

 

*- Custom Asset - paste Moons contract address* 0x0057Ac2d777797d31CD3f8f13bF5e927571D6Ad0 (rest will be filled automatically in Mathwallet, else use Token name: Moons; Token symbol: MOON; Token precision/decimals:18) - *click Add*.

**Now you see both.**

[ MOON &amp; ETH in wallet](https://preview.redd.it/wzbe1qbsf23a1.jpg?width=1080&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7d7256d85a2f28e55927627ba1b2b0175d5e5b04)

 **Point 4.** yes, there are many scammers on Telegram, but really, they are basically everywhere. So don't be afraid of it. If you're android user, download the .apk from official site telegram org. The app in Google Play Store and Apple Store is censored. No, this is not a joke or conspiracy, it is fact. If you are iOS user, you have only one native app option - that censored app. But there is a good news, you don't need to use app on mobile phone. You can download the PC program or use web.telegram org in any web browser. It will work fine for this purpose.

**In your Telegram profile, you need to set public username to do the airdrop by this method.**

\- *Join official rCryptoCurrency group*. Link to the group is here in [Useful links](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/wiki/moons_wiki#wiki_useful_links)

In Telegram app register for [Moon TipBot](https://www.reddit.com/user/nanooverbtc/comments/qgxvz3/how_to_register_for_moon_tipbot/). In our group find ""user"" Moon TipBot or do general search `@MoonTipBot`and go chat with it.

[tipbot](https://preview.redd.it/kazt8y9ag23a1.jpg?width=424&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2624dc0462d9a16084f9f8653e233a0b7038887f)

\- *Click START to start the bot.*

[ start the bot by pressing START](https://preview.redd.it/4i0c03kjg23a1.jpg?width=741&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b2db990154821ba0135867392ebfe679666021bf)

 

**You will be using predefined commands.**

1^(st) command is for registering your address where you hold your Moons for airdrop. This address can be used for withdrawing your Moons too. Write the command `/register YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS`

2^(nd) command is for adding Moons ""into"" bot so you can use them for tipping inside telegram group and for your **awesome airdrops**. `/deposit`

[deposit command](https://preview.redd.it/mmb01i2xg23a1.jpg?width=214&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=35a8bdc4a0895096691153babf6cf729b81f771a)

 in return the bot will give you your deposit address.

[your deposit address](https://preview.redd.it/3jyw1e64h23a1.jpg?width=226&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e129c59e9313afba32428b994eb4aa80e8ee7320)

 Open your crypto wallet app and send Moons to that address as standard crypto transfer. You can send let's say 1 Moon first, to see, if it works. After a while of sending that 1 Moon go back in bot chat and use command `/balance`. It should be there. Now you deposit more. 

[balance command](https://preview.redd.it/p3ae3p99h23a1.jpg?width=701&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=41dff4d241f2e2246f2d962d6a1e40f117ce5093)

# OK, now the fun part begins.

In rCryptoCurrency Telegram group use the command `/airdrop &lt;MOON amount&gt; &lt;number of collectors&gt;`  
e.g. you want to give 0.01 MOON to 5 users, you write in group chat `/airdrop 0.01 5`  
 = First 5 users in chat who press the gift button will get those sweet Moons from you!

Anytime you want to see your current Moon balance, just write the bot `/balance`. Using your Moons in Telegram does not use any more gas fees. You spent eth just for initial Moons deposits.

There are other tipping commands for use in group:

`/randtip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;number of collectors&gt;`  
 Tip MOON to random number of users in Telegram Group `/tip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;@user&gt;`  
 Tip MOON to Telegram user with their username `/freetip &lt;amount&gt; &lt;duration&gt;`  
 Split amount of MOON to all collectors within a duration in seconds

I already paid Quest in autumn of *last* year when the labs first came due. My insurance has proof of their payment and agrees that I am due a refund. Quest has been doing everything in their power to avoid me and my insurance, including refusing to email back, putting us on hold indefinitely (over an hour once), and agents hanging up on us. What do I need to do? It’s very cut and dry and my insurance is as fed up as I am.

I finally got somebody at Quest who sent it up the chain, but now they are telling me they need a copy of the check my insurance sent. My insurance sent an e-check in the exact amount of the refund I am due, gave me the date it was cashed by Quest, and the check number. Quest says that isn’t good enough, they want a copy.

I have a call into one particular senior insurance rep who pulled for me moreso than others, whom I think must be on holiday from Thanksgiving. But, on the whole this has been weeks of runaround. If she doesn’t call back, I don’t know what to do. Quest has told me they don’t have the corrected EOB, although I found a rep who said they did and didn’t know why it wasn’t processed (but then didn’t correct it, naturally). I emailed them both the original and updated EOBs from my records, and again that still isn’t enough. Is there a state board or something I can complain to? All in all Quest has been holding my money since March of this year. I would like options because I’ll be back at square one if this rep doesn’t call back.

Edit: You guys are helping me fight fire with fire, and I *really* appreciate it! I’m learning a lot. Thank you!",finance,1669805316
stocks,"Euro zone inflation falls for first time in 17 months, bolstering hopes for smaller ECB hike","https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2022/1130/1339160-euro-zone-inflation-falls-for-first-time-in-17-months/

The annual rate of inflation across the euro area eased back to 10% in November, according to an initial 'flash' estimate from the EU’s statistical agency Eurostat.

This compares to an annual rate of 10.6% recorded in October and is the first fall in the rate of inflation in 17 consecutive months.

The main contributor to inflation remains the cost of energy but the annual rate of energy price increases slowed last month to 34.9%, down from 41.5% in October.

However, food inflation accelerated slightly to 13.6% from 13.1%.

The rate of inflation for industrial goods and services remained steady.

Core inflation, which strips out energy and food prices, also remained steady at an annual rate of 5%.

Ireland’s estimated harmonised index of consumer prices also fell back to 9% from an annual rate of 9.4% in October.

According to a statement from the CSO, the energy component of Ireland's 'flash’ estimate of inflation rose by 0.1% last month and slowed to an annual rate of 43%.

This compares to a jump in energy prices in October of 13.6% and an annual rate of energy price inflation of 47.6%.

The CSO will publish the Consumer Price Index for November next week.

The European Central Bank meets later in December when it's expected to raise interest rates again. Speculation continues over whether that rate rise will be 0.5% or 0.75%.

With inflation running at more than five times its 2% target, the ECB has raised interest rates at its fastest pace on record this year and a string of hikes over the coming months is still likely as price growth will take years to tame.

But after back-to-back 75-basis-point moves, some policymakers have recently made the case for a 50 bp rise on 15 December, arguing that inflation is finally peaking and that the ECB has made enough progress to justify more modest steps.

While the dip in headline prices, the euro zone's first in well over a year, strengthens the case for more measured ECB action next month, Wednesday's data could also fuel fears that inflation will prove more persistent than expected.

Underlying price growth, excluding volatile food and energy prices, remained high, which is likely to trigger warnings from conservative central bankers, while food price growth, a key concern for governments, shows little sign of peaking.

Filtering out food and fuel costs, inflation rose to 6.6% from 6.4%, defying expectations for a drop, while an even more narrow measure that also excludes alcohol and tobacco held steady at 5.0%.

Inflation for processed food, alcohol and tobacco, a key category, meanwhile accelerated to 13.6% from 12.4%.

Another complication is that economic growth is not suffering as much as some had anticipated, so the deflationary impact of a looming winter recession is likely to be more modest than once thought.

Initially fuelled by supply bottlenecks in the post-pandemic reopening, inflation is now driven by soaring food prices after a poor harvest and sky-high energy costs in the fallout of Russia's war in Ukraine.

It may still edge back up in the coming months, especially at the turn of the year when energy contracts get repriced, but it is likely to decline through 2023 and return to the vicinity of 2% by the end of 2024.

Such a rapid decline lacks historical precedence, some policymakers warn, suggesting that today's small decline is unlikely to be a game-changer for where rates end up over the cycle of monetary tightening.",finance,1669807940

# [S&amp;P 500 futures are flat as Wall Street awaits Powell speech on economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were flat on Wednesday as Wall Street awaits an afternoon speech on the economy from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell.
*****
&gt; S&amp;P 500 futures were essentially little changed, with the benchmark looking to snap a 3-day losing streak. Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 18 points. Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.1%.
*****
&gt; Traders were hit with two reports Wednesday morning that caused volatility in stock futures. On one hand, a labor report signaled the job market could be cooling, raising hopes the Federal Reserve would slow its aggressive rate-hiking campaign. On the other hand, an updated reading of third-quarter gross domestic product was released and it showed the economy was stronger last period than first realized.
*****
&gt; Payroll processing firm ADP said Wednesday that private companies added just 127,000 positions for the month, well below the 190,000 consensus estimate from economists polled by Dow Jones.
*****
&gt; But the Bureau of Economic Analysis also said Wednesday that third-quarter GDP increased at a 2.9% annual rate, according to its second estimate. That was revised higher from the 2.6% first estimate.
*****
&gt; Powell will give a speech at the Brookings Institution this afternoon that may give further insight into the central bank’s thinking on future interest rate increases. The Fed is slated to meet later this month and is largely expected to deliver a smaller 0.5 percentage point rate hike after four consecutive 0.75 percentage point increases to tame high inflation. Any signal of a pivot on future rate hikes would likely send markets higher.
*****
&gt; “This is a Fed-made recession, so eventually when he does pivot, the market should move higher pretty quickly,” said Steve Grasso, CEO of Grasso Global, on CNBC’s “Fast Money” Tuesday.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a mixed session. The Nasdaq Composite shed 0.59% and the S&amp;P 500 lost 0.16%, marking the third straight negative day for each. The Dow Jones Industrial Average notched a marginal gain, closing 3.07 points, or 0.01%, higher.
*****
&gt; Stocks have been weighed down by China’s zero-Covid policy and have failed to fully recover from losses even as the country announced steps toward reopening, such as an uptick in vaccination rates for the elderly.

personalfinance,Trying to Buy First House But Feel Like My Loan Just Isn't Right,"So I'm trying to buy my first house and I have 20k in federal student loans and 7k left on my car. I make 40k a year currently and have a credit score of 789. I'm not in a huge hurry to buy a house but was recently prequalified for a mortgage through Rocket Mortgage of 100k.

The loan type they gave me however is an FHA, I have about 10k of money to split between closing and down payment but at a fixed 30 year loan they are saying before taxes and other additions on my payment per month at the full amount I'd be paying roughly 800 a month at the full 96.5k loan.

Is this rate too high for my credit score currently? I'd really appreciate any advice on any aspect of this honestly",finance,1669817745

CryptoCurrency,Being you own bank...,"One of the most important functions of cryptocurrency is its ability to allow you to be your own bank. Banking the unbanked is a huge effort and is nessicary to help people procure good and services but also to accept payments, send currency, exchange currencies for other currencies, originating loans, and more. Currently there is about 4.5% of the US population that is unbanked and about 17.5% globally. This means those people have little or no access to those services or must use some other means to access them outside of their central banking system. So, how is this problem being solved? 

Traditionally, those unbanked people have been using ""Mobile Money"" services. I think it's important to note that, regardless of the marketing in the crypto space, crypto didn't solve this problem originally. Centralized services have been filling this void for many years and doing a pretty good job. Crypto marketing has also done a good job of pretending to be the only solution here, but is actually the new kid on the block (pun intended, not sorry). So what advantages do crypto services provide then?

Defi doesn't put the management of those funds or transactions in the hands of a human CEO and the monetary policy can be more reliable as it is coded into smart contracts that you can interact with to achieve almost everything a traditional bank can provide. So why use a centralized bank at all? 

Centralization of banks was actually the solution to these withdrawl runs that have been happening recently in the crypto space, often leading to bankruptcy. When this happens at your local bank, they just borrow funds from the FED to cover your withdrawal. This way they can continue to loan out your deposits which allows them to fund other services like loan origination with a very low risk of running out of funds. When a bank run occurs with an exchange/bank such as Celsius (a centralized service, not to be confused with centralized banking), who do they turn to to cover the withdrawals? Other exchanges are their only option since there is no centralized entity designed to help them in these rare cases.

There are other risks to decentralization of a banking system or being your own bank though. We have seen that being your own security expert is not for everyone. Security concerns change constantly and managing that yourself can lead to losing everything you hold on those services. There is no insurance when this happens either or rather no guarantee that some centralized entity will cover your loss from theft or mismanagement. The FDIC does this in the US for example for up to $250,000 per account. 

Doing your own research is also frought with peril. Firstly, research is hard when done right. You don't get a job in research with a GED for example. People with advanced degrees are put in those positions. When you are reading about crypto you are likely just browsing information and often will attach yourself to ideas that confirm what you already know leading to confirmation bias. Your research is also not peer reviewed which is a major component, even for the most educated people on the planet, to ensure quality research has been done. In a market so complicated the dyor is a common theme, this is hardly an advantage for the ordinary user. The proof of this is right here on reddit with the daily mistakes people have made in identifying a sound financial institution or in the misuse of those institutions' services.

So finally, the need to be your own bank is a problem well solved through centralized services that have been operating for years. Venturing into decentralized services comes with signifigant risks of loss as well. I would love to hear from the community about your specific reasons for using crypto services in place of a proven ""Mobile Money"" service, how you mitigate the risks, and if you feel like crypto is adding something innovative to the challenge of banking the unbanked.

personalfinance,Sharing my budgeting tips for the shopping season (despite the crazy inflation),"Hey guys! As a fresh grad working in Poland (currently with a 17.9% inflation rate omg) I want to share some of my personal budgeting tips now that the shopping season has officially started. I know that all of these ads around us are tempting, and we want to buy gifts for the holidays, plus the insane inflation rate this year certainly make these decisions even tougher. So I reflected and gathered some tips that I hope could help people who are struggling like me.

1.  Always consider if you really need the stuff. You can’t imagine how much people buy because of emotions and not using the new item afterward. (me included)
2. Always remember that a discount over another discount is less than the sum of both discounts. Example: If you see a 40% discount over 30%, that is not a 70% discount.  It doesn't mean that somebody doesn't know how to add 40 to 30: it means that the original discount was 40% off, then 30% was taken from the new price. So in total, for this example, the effective discount is 58%, not 70%. I was also shookt with this haha and only learned about it after using [a discount calculator](https://www.omnicalculator.com/collections/shopping) that I saw online.
3. If you need something, but the ad says you will get it cheaper if you buy 3 or 4 products, ask yourself: “Do I really need three hairdryers?” This deal makes sense if you're buying many gifts.
4.  Never ever pay the credit card minimum payment. You might think it is such a small amount, but beware, my financial padawan; the interest might rip you off. Only paying the minimum payments may mean you never pay off the debt. Trust me - I've experienced this.
5.  Before you buy stuff in several installments, plan ahead for your credit card payoff date and be sure to know the interest rate you are being charged. You will then learn how much you will end up paying and, most importantly, if you will be able to pay it. 
6. Budget, budget, budget! The 50/30/20 rule works for me personally, but feel free to tweak it based on your circumstances. What I learned is that progress is *not* linear and that includes our finances. Don't be too hard on yourself and make adjustments when needed :)",finance,1669820821

CryptoCurrency,"The importance of decentralization, and not your keys not your coins","Sometimes I wonder if the majority of crypto investors are even aware of Satoshi's intent when he created btc. 

It sprung from the 2008 financial collapse where banks were once again bailed out by taxpayer money from average Joe and Jane. *Your* money. 

You're granted the honour of indebting yourself to a bank, usually for the privilege of ""owning"" your own home = renting it from the bank, who is your de facto landlord. And the higher the housing prices get, the more profit for the banks, while more and more of your disposable income goes to servicing your debt.

Meanwhile the FED and other central banks set interest rates and print money at will, which started with leaving the gold standard back in 1971 (by Nixon, a Republican) where fiat no longer had to be backed by gold. It turned into 'fractional reserve banking' where banks were free to lend out 90% of *your* fiat deposited in the bank, and in March 2020 turned into zero reserve banking under Trump (another Republican). 

*The ultra-rich are not your friends.*

Truly decentralized crypto is the whole point of Satoshi's creation. It is financial democracy. Centralization means power is concentrated in the hands of a few - like premined VC garbage coins like solana and luna and other crap. 

Stop whining about SBF and others walking out scot-free, benefiting from centralization and corruption, while simultaneously keeping your shit on exchanges.

Not your keys, not your coins. I repeat: *not your keys, not your coins.*

Get your shit off exchanges and stop with the mindless staking and similar practices which only allows  someone else to ""lend"" out your coins (or even better - donate them to themselves and/or friends/family and/or politicians...).

And when inflation sets in from all the money printing, interest rates are raised - and once again, who are the winners? Banks, yes. And the losers? *You.* Again.

Decentralization matters. Scarcity matters. Fundamentals matter.

Recently started a new job that pays well with benefits, and wondering if I should pay off the rest of my 2016 Mazda because car payments suck. I have $7,700 remaining on my car with a 3.9% interest rate. I pay $254 a month on the car. 

I currently make around $3300 a month after taxes. My standard of living is fairly low (I'm cheap af) and all my expenses come out to roughly $1100 (rent, insurance, groceries, etc.) 

I currently have $18,000 saved up. No other debt besides my car and my student loans (hoping to have them wiped out pending the forgiveness lawsuits). Should I just pay off the remaining sum on my car or begin investing my money elsewhere? I'm currently researching 401ks/IRA's outside of my employer to get a jumpstart on that side of things.

CryptoCurrency,Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December,,cryptocurrency,1669833599
stocks,Fed Chair Powell says smaller interest rate hikes could start in December,"*  **Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead and could start in December.**
* **But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.**
* **“We will stay the course until the job is done,” he said during a speech in Washington, D.C. at the Brookings Institution.**

WASHINGTON – Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell confirmed Wednesday that smaller interest rate increases are likely ahead even as he sees progress in the fight against inflation as largely inadequate.

Echoing recent statements from other central bank officials and comments at the November Fed meeting, Powell said he sees the central bank in position to reduce the size of rate hikes as soon as next month.

But he cautioned that monetary policy is likely to stay restrictive for some time until real signs of progress emerge on inflation.

“Despite some promising developments, we have a long way to go in restoring price stability,” Powell said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution.

The chairman noted that policy moves such as interest rate increases and the reduction of the Fed’s bond holdings generally take time to make their way through the system.

“Thus, it makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” he added. “The time for moderating the pace of rate increases may come as soon as the December meeting.”

Markets already had been pricing in about a 65% chance that the Fed would step down its interest rate increases to half of a percentage point in December, following four successive 0.75-point moves, according to CME Group data. That pace of rate hikes is the most aggressive since the early 1980s.

What remains to be seen is where the Fed goes from there. With markets pricing in the likelihood of rate cuts later in 2023, Powell instead warned that restrictive policy will stay in place until inflation shows more consistent signs of receding.

“Given our progress in tightening policy, the timing of that moderation is far less significant than the questions of how much further we will need to raise rates to control inflation, and the length of time it will be necessary to hold policy at a restrictive level,” Powell said.

“It is likely that restoring price stability will require holding policy at a restrictive level for some time. History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy,” he added. “We will stay the course until the job is done.”

Powell’s remarks come with some halting signs that inflation is ebbing and the ultra-tight labor market is loosening.

Earlier this month, the consumer price index indicating inflation rising but by less than what economists had estimated. Separate reports Wednesday showed private payroll growth far lower than expected in November while job openings also declined.

However, Powell said short-term data can be deceptive and he needs to see more consistent evidence.

For instance, he said Fed economists expect that the central bank’s preferred core personal consumption expenditures price index in October, to be released Thursday, will show inflation running at a 5% annual pace. That would be down from 5.1% in September but still well ahead of the Fed’s 2% long-run target.

“It will take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining,” Powell said. “By any standard, inflation remains much too high.”

“I will simply say that we have more ground to cover,” he added.

Powell added that he expects the ultimate peak for rates – the “terminal rate” – will be “somewhat higher than thought” when the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee members made their last projections in September. Committee members at the time said they expected the terminal rate to hit 4.6%; markets now see it in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CME Group data.

Supply chain issues at the core of the inflation burst have eased, Powell said, while growth broadly as slowed to below trend, even with a 2.9% annualized gain in third-quarter GDP. He expects housing inflation to rise into next year but then likely fall.

However, he said the labor market has shown “only tentative signs of rebalancing” after job openings had outnumbered available workers by a 2 to 1 margin. That gap has closed to 1.7 to 1 but remains well above historical norms.

The tight labor market has resulted in a big boost in worker wages that nonetheless have failed to keep up with inflation.

“To be clear, strong wage growth is a good thing. But for wage growth to be sustainable, it needs to be consistent with 2% inflation,” he said.

What is the downside of taking a say 10 year callable CD at 5.1% (current rate) and get higher interest for a bit. If interest rates stay high, I'll still get 5.1% for however long until they call the CD and if they drop in 6 months well I had a 6 month ride of 5.1% (they pay monthly).

I've only had a credit card for about 3 years, and one of my friends parents brought it to my attention that I might struggle to get a good deal on a housing loan since I have no loan history. I had always been taught that the only thing that really mattered when it comes to getting a loan is your salary and your debt to income ratio. However, I have been informed that this may not be totally true. Which brought me to the idea of slightly upgrading my car (financing around \~10k after trade in) and paying if off over the next 4-5 years. From my understanding, that would likely cost me \~5k in interest, and while I don't like the idea of giving away 5k for free, if that gets me a .5% better rate on a house, that trade-off becomes immensely worth it in the long run. I'm just very fuzzy on how actually getting a better interest rate works, and if my not having any loan history will actually be a problem. Or, if that .5% initially really doesn't matter because I could just re-finance my loan after 2 years or something.

It appears to be a rehash of the usual ""they're about to implement martial law"" or ""they're gonna make me go vegan"" tropes.

&amp;#x200B;

Frankly I think all the surveillance that people are freaking out about is already here, keep in mind that your purchases are already registered and logged at almost all retailers, and if you pay by card, own a smartphone etc then your location, purchases, personal info is all kept by private companies and freely accessible to the government already.

Amazon stores your purchase data indefinately. PRISM is understood to monitor *all* internet activity globally. Your browsing and purchases have been logged by government agencies for over a decade.

&amp;#x200B;

Any form of tyrannical control over markets can be done already if your government chooses to.

A functioning democracy would need to legislate to regulate people's purchases. The law would fall upon retailers, payment providers and individuals. The same way tobacco is regulated - the buyer and the seller can both be prosecuted for unlawful purchases. That happens irrespective of the payment method.

If the government can legistale the Fed's CBDC to force you to buy vegan food, then they can also simply legislate Walmart and Visa to do it too.

And dictatorships already announce the regulation of purchases regardless of how you pay.

&amp;#x200B;

The CBDC argument also fails the common sense test - plenty of tyranny and control of goods and services exists withou the help of CBDCs, from Venezuela to North Korea, to milder examples like the regulation of tobacco and alcohol in developed nations. Additionally, things like rationing and temporary restrictions have also existed without CBDCs, from food in WW2 to PS5s at Gamestop. Eggs are rationed where I live right now because of bird flu.

If lack of CBDCs and digital tech was the only thing that kept us from tyranny, then the USSR in the 1980s would have been a free-market paradise - Cash only, no cards, no computers. In reality, it was the opposite.

&amp;#x200B;

I think people are so reactionary and shallow in their understanding of politics and control that they're focussed on a complete red herring here.

Frankly it reminds me of the Capitol Insurrection crowd, who espoused great concern about surveillance and control yet willingly used smartphone apps that recorded their location to private companies that were then subpoenaed by the government.

If you have a smartphone, a Visa card and a social media account, then I cannot take your fears about CBDC privacy seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

I think everything that people are afraid of about CBDCs is already here.

And I worry that hysteria over CBDC leads people to ignore the true invasions of our privacy like PRISM, social media companies, big tech etc.",cryptocurrency,1669840296

I'm 25F making 64k yearly, I'm currently in the position to either pay off my car entirely or pay off my private student loans + my private loan. My dad has given me $12,600 to go ahead and pay off my car loan, but he said that if i needed to pay any other debt first i could do so. I plan to pay him back the $12,600 in the near future, but he lent me the money with no deadline so that i could avoid paying as much interest as i currently do. Either decision i make, i'm going to move forward with making the designated ""payments"" into my savings accounts so that once the money is fully collected again, i can hand it back to my dad. I have no credit card debt btw, its just these three debts.

I'm torn because at the moment i don't really have a savings and would love to build one up as soon as possible with the recession going on and all!

My car loan is $12,600 with an interest rate of 10.9% (it's super high, i know!) I've tried to refinance but it seems like my car being over 10 years limits that for me. Its a monthly payment of $257 set to be completely paid off in 5 years with the minimum payment.

My private student loan is $6,000 with an interest rate of 7.74% and a monthly payment of $74. It's set to be completely paid off within 10 years unless I find a way to make extra payments. I've been paying this off since 2019 and the amount has stayed roughly the same somehow.

My personal loan is $6,900 with an interest rate of 9.31% and a monthly payment of $160.98. It's set to be completely paid off within 4 years and 5 months.

I planned to refinance my private loan further, but it'll be roughly 6 months before i'm able to do so again since i recently had refinanced from 11-7.74.

What do you guys suggest I do?

I'm currently searching for a higher paying job and in January/February will be moving into a cheaper apartment, so at the moment i'm finding ways to reduce costs and increase income in order to pay these all off sooner than the set dates!

CryptoCurrency,About Brazil’s Digital Assets Law: summary and some points,"The Law 4.401/21 regulates digital assets (not ""cryptocurrencies"") in Brazil. It has passed in both Lower House and Senate and is waiting for an act from the Federal Government to finally establish it.

I've tried to get the main points for you people. Pay attention to the weakest points section. 

# Summary

The first draft was submitted in 2015 to the Lower House.  The congressman who did it, Aureo Ribeiro, belongs to a center-left party (Solidariedade). The main points are:

* It legally defines what digital assets are**:** any ""virtual representation of value that can be traded or transferred by electronic means and used for settling payments or with the purpose of investments""
* Not included in this definition: national and foreign currencies and their electronic representations, things like fidelity points from credit cards and, naturally, stocks
* **It's up to the Executive Power to establish or determine an Agency to explicitly decide which assets can be affected by the law**
* The Agency pointed by the Federal Government to regulate the market will give a deadline of no less than 6 months for Exchanges to adequate themselves to the new Law.

# Exchanges

These are defined to be the legally established company that executes **at least one of the following**, on behalf of their customers:

* Trades between digital assets and national or foreign currencies
* Trades amongst one or more digital assets
* Transfer of digital assets
* Custody or management of digital assets
* Participation in financial services related to Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or sales of digital assets

The Law states that the services involving digital assets must be based on: 

* Free initiative and competition
* Good governance practices and a risk-based approach
* Data and personal information protection
* Consumer protection, protection to popular savings and money laundering prevention

# Strongest Points

* Digital assets are legally defined
* Exchanges' operations are legally defined
* The Law explicitly is about digital assets, not cryptocurrencies. Therefore **NFTs are also subject to it**
* Institutions will need approval from the Central Bank to offer their digital asset's services, which can be accumulated with other financial services (this is also a weak point)

# Weakest Points

* Protection to customer's funds are not guaranteed: the Senate had added a section stating that if an exchange goes bankrupt, they can't use their customers' funds to pay other creditors, therefore guaranteeing that each customer had total rights over their funds. Exchanges also could not use customer funds to trade or use them as collateral (the same done by e.g. FTX) without explicit consent. The congressman responsible to present the final text to the Congress before the vote took place, Expedito Netto, removed this section, stating that ""it's on the customer's interest that exchanges have freedom to do as they please"" \[sic\]. He also said that the situation is the same as done by banks. He was not re-elected in last month's election. 
* The Society/Union of Brazilian exchanges positioned themselves against the points added by the Senate. Indicative that they do use your funds as liabilities and a reminder to avoid using exchanges as banks.
* It will take some time for the Law to be effective in practice, as the Agency to be pointed as the refulated still is undecided. I tend to believe this will be CVM, the agency that already regulates stocks and things related to non-tangible assets

# tl;dr

The Law regulates digital assets and legally classifies them. It is pending the signature of the President to be effective. Points that would strongly defend customers and that were added in the Senate were removed by the Lower House before the vote.",cryptocurrency,1669842129

Doing some math using an early payoff calculator it looks like I can save quite a substantial amount off of my amortized interest by performing extra payments to the principal.

By increasing my payments by 25%, I can save an amortized 2.6% off of my APY or increasing the payments by 34% I can save 2.9% for an adjusted rate of 5.0% or 4.7% respectively. This also has the side benefit of reducing my mortgage from 30 years to 15 years. Anything beyond this causes significantly diminishing returns.

My wife (43/F) has been a rock, and we are doing well.

Onto the other part- I'm in line to inherit somewhere between $300-350k from my grandparents' estate. The total depends on items they owned that are going to be auctioned (art, antique furniture, etc). From there, I don't really know what to do with it. I own a home with around $285k left on the mortgage (2.625%), a vehicle with \~$13k left on the loan (2.25%), and a solar installation loan \~$18k (1.2%). Have \~120k in the stock market, $10k emergency fund in savings, \~$8k in checking. Combined income of $130k/yr in LCOL state, we are doing fine. No kids, no CC debt, max out the 401k already w/ no employer match. We already have three cars for the two of us, one of which is new and the other ones are fine, no need to buy a new car, no big purchases we've been holding off on or anything.
