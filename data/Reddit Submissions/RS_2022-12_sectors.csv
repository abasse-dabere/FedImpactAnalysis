personalfinance,Treasury Bills Interest Rates,I'm interested in investing in a 4 week t-bill but am confused about the interest rate. The current rate for the 4 week is about 4%. Does that mean I will get 4% of my initial investment after one month? Thanks.,finance,1669854169
investing,Robinhood Gold 3.75% APY vs US 30yr Treasury Bond 3.75%,"I recently received an email from Robinhood advertising their new interest rate for uninvested cash which is at 3.75% APY. This seems incredibly high and is equal to the current US 30yr treasury bond yield. The liquidity one would have with Robinhood's offer is clearly much better, and Robinhood is FDIC insured as well. What am I missing here? There is a $5 monthly fee for Robinhood Gold which is where I am getting this rate from, but why would anyone ever buy a bond again?

I currently am sitting on a lot of saved money and am slowly investing into ETFS while having the majority of my money accrue gains through money market funds. These are liquid and low risk but only yield 2.something percent. I am wondering if anyone is in a similar position and not wanting to dive into the market, and if so, what they are doing with their money in the meantime.",finance,1669856994
personalfinance,Personal loan to pay off credit cards??,I have about $2.5k in credit card debt spread out pretty evenly across 4 different cards. Each have an APR of around 25-28% each. Every week i put like a couple hundred towards paying them off but i’m wondering if it makes more sense to take out a personal loan to pay these off? The ones i’m currently looking at have an interest rate at around 12-14% with like a 2 or 3 year pay off. Any thoughts on if this is a good move?,finance,1669860146
business,What do you suggest?,"Hey everyone!

Im a 21 year old guy and my life goal ever since I was a child was to become wealthy. 
I found a good job and will move to another country which offers a much higher salary, there I will live all alone. 

I put pen to paper, rented a place, did my food planning and listed all of my profits and expenses, consulted friends and locals thus coming to this conclusion:
Every month I can save up 800-900€, however lets take 700€ as the absolute minimum. 
My goal is to work hard as an employee for around 10 years and than invest all of my money in a restaurant- business back home. 

What would you suggest? I assume investing? Obviously if I let my saved up money lay in the bank... thats safe/dead money right there. What investment plan would you advice? Index,ETF, Crypto, Stocks? My mind is gonna explode, how much ROI can I expect? Whats the risk cost benefit? I have no one knowledgeable to consult with so I'd appreciate any advice coming my way!

I already have 10k... shamefully in a bank.",finance,1669860415
investing,What's the typical difference in borrowing costs for a callable vs non-callable loan?,"I see a lot of stories in the news about liquidity crises sped up by lenders calling in their loans when they smell bad market conditions or perceive the borrower as suddenly too risky. What are the typical conditions under which business loans are callable? Can most business loans be called in any time for immediate repayment?

The borrower must pay a lower interest rate if the agree for the loan to be callable, right? It seems like there would be a lot of situations where the loaned capital could be tied up in illiquid investments or capital projects. Surely the borrower would be willing to pay a premium to ensure the lender can't demand early repayment. If you were running a small business, for example, and needed a loan for start-up costs, why would you put yourself in a position where your lenders could suddenly demand full repayment when you may not have the cash on hand and would be forced to sell off assets at an inopportune time or at a loss? It just seems so much safer to know exactly how much you have to pay back and when.

So I was wondering--what kind of price differences do you see in business loans that are callable vs non-callable and under what conditions can a lender typically demand early repayment?",finance,1669860452

personalfinance,Missed credit card annual fee,"Hello,

I have an old Capital one card that I hang on to just because it's my oldest account.  I never use it because it's got a high interest rate and no benefits to speak of.  I just pay the $39 member fee each year. 

Except for this year, I forgot about the annual fee and didn't realize what happened until the payment was 32 days old.  I'd like to minimize the damage to my credit score if possible.

Is there anything I can do?  I am thinking of just canceling the card but wonder if losing my oldest account would just make things worse.  

** Update **
I appreciate all of the feedback. I made contact with Capital One and they are forgiving that payment which will trigger a credit correction. So far, Experian is the only bureau that shows the 30 day late. It reduced my score more than 100 points.

Thanks",finance,1669871565

Update 4-11-2022

Dear Diary

So the 15th of December I started my journey into crypto.

Because I did not have the funds to go in lump sum, I will follow the strategy which I described in my original post.

So to sum it up:

\- Monthly deposit to exchanges;

\- DCA 80% of deposit weekly over top 5 Mcap;

\- Allocate 20% to Buy the Dip;

\- Stake holdings on exchange;

\- Investment horizon 5 years;

\- Dip defined as minimal 8% drop on 24H time frame.

\- For DCA I will also look into the Fear and Greed index. DCA more when the market is in fear, DCA less when in greed.

\- For the meme I also DCA a bit into DOGE... :)

\- ADJUSTMENT-

I have started to buy the dip a bit more aggressively. As we come deeper in the Bear market I decided it was time to push my average cost down a bit more. Also once I have started to buy a coin in the top five I keep DCA into it. I stop when they exit the top 10 excluding stable coins.

Now to update where do I stand and what are the results up till now

So to measure performance, I will look at what this strategy has done compared to a lump sum investment at my starting point on the 15th of December.

UPDATE

Must admit I had FOMO...made a gamble on Luna....probably a stupid one.....I'll keep it and take it as a lesson learned.....Stick to the F$#@%$\* plan!!!

I have adjusted my strategy a bit. I am upping my investment in BTC and ETH compared to alts.

UPDATE 19-9-2022

Heavy on BTC and ETH.

UPDATE 28-9-2022

Implement flexible DCA day and time. When pump postpone DCA in bear market.

UPDATE 7-10-2022

Starting to look like a very good time to accumulate. Still wondering if there is going to be another drop. Hold off on DCA this week, due to unemployment rates release in the US today and FOMC minutes next week.

UPDATE 29-10-2022

As Elon bought Twitter I acquired some additional DOGE....Small bet hoping to pay off.

So as you all can see some have worked out better then the others.

But IMO it is very interesting that we are in a downtrend combined with this strategy.

When I first heard about bitcoin in 2012 in undergrad, I scoffed at the idea of artificial currency that is technologically advanced, but mainly used for silk roads and chinese money laundering. That... cant replace the money we use today right? 

However recent events really had me let that faith go... that the government will work for the interest of people and hold tight control of economy as failure to do so means loss of decades for many. Now I laugh at that idea. Our system is always about damage control over prevention, and delaying problems until it pops. It was the best we had, but it's not the best we will have. 

When all the smoke and dust clears, we will have cryptos that will function as designed. Decentralized, efficient, transparent financial system that no longer allow people like Powell go for a game and tip his golf buddies about rate hikes while blabbering inflation is transitory for months.

CryptoCurrency,Just had a really intense dream that I was in a Holy War to protect Bitcoin from the elites. This was my dream My question to you now: would you fight for Bitcoin?,"I just woke up a few hours ago and I'm writing this down to try and remember all the details but i was in a Bitcoin City or something and The Fiat emperors were on the outskirts of the city. For some reason it was more like a Medieval Knights type of vibe going on with the army. 

Michael Saylor was on of the generals at the front lines and looking like one of those apocalyptic horseman riding a black horse.

 Max Keiser showed up all coked out screaming ""Fyck Elon we're not selling!""
Even Peter Mccormack and Pompliano and Saifedean all the other bitcoin personalities were there. 

It all felt so spiritual and intense. Like a Holy War. We were fighting for the future of humanity. For freedom from the tyrants. The cantillionaires and their money spigot they had used to oppress us for centuries. The new world was upon us. Freedom and prosperity. A new age of wisdom and self sovereignty was upon us. 

Across the battle field were the Central Bankers armies. Black Helicopters. Giant Pig like men that towered above the Miltary tanks. Massive Catapults and Ballistas. Above them were dark clouds bellowing with thunder and lighting. 

The atmosphere was electric. We realized the enormity of this battle. This was for the new.  revolution. This was for the people. 

Then the trumpets blew. 
""Cyber Hornets - Charge!!!"" Screamed Saylor. ""ARGGGGHHH"" all the Bitcoin Warriors ran towards the enemy. It was all a blur but after the chaos, we were heavily outnumbered and outmatched. We lost. All over were strewn the bodies of blood soaked warriors losing to the modern armies of their Fiat Overlords. 

Max Keisers body was twisted up like a pretzel. Michael Saylor was fighting for his life. Dead warriors everywhere. This was the end. A new age of darkness would befall us all. All hope was lost. Sadness and gloom filled our hearts.

And just then everyone went silent and looked up at the night sky. A glowing figure made of light was slowly descending from the sky! 

You could hear the whispers ""The prophecy! He's here!"" ""That's Satoshi!""

Then there was a loud beeping sound. I couldn't figure out where it was coming from. I couldn't understand what was happening anymore. Then I realised where I was, in bed. It was my alarm. I woke up almost in tears and out of breath. That was such an intense dream. It was almost like a movie.

I think the meaning of this is clear: I'm going to buy some bitcoin today.

So my question to you is. If in the future there realty was a war for Bitcoin, would you fight? Or would you agree to live in a world where you owned nothing, had no privacy or autonomy. Where you were just a puppet to be played with at the whims of the elite. What would you choose?",cryptocurrency,1669902312

Inflation rose in October about in line with estimates, sending a sign that price increases at least are stabilizing, the Commerce Department reported Thursday.

The core personal consumption expenditures price index, a gauge that excludes food and energy and is favored by the Federal Reserve, rose 0.2% for the month and was up 5% from a year ago. The monthly increase was below the 0.3% Dow Jones estimate, while the annual gain was in line.

The gains also represent deceleration from September, which saw a monthly increase of 0.5% and an annual gain of 5.2%.

Including food and energy, headline PCE was up 0.3% on the month and 6% on an annual basis. The monthly increase was the same as September, while the annual gain was a step down from the 6.3% pace.

The department also reported that personal income jumped 0.7% for the month, well ahead of the 0.4% estimate, and spending rose 0.8%, as expected.

While the Fed takes in a broad range of measures to gauge inflation, it prefers the PCE index as it takes into account changes in consumer behavior such as substituting less expensive goods for pricier items. That’s different than the consumer price index, which is a raw measure of changes in prices.

Policymakers view core inflation as a more reliable measure as food and energy prices tend to fluctuate more than other items.

This again show signs that inflation is cooling off.  It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. We will probably see more of Fed interest rate hike influence  on Dec. 13th with the release of CPI data.

So I'm married with a child. The child will be starting school in 3-4 years. We're also planning on having another before then, God willing. I love our current house situation, the mortgage is cheap (2.85%) and I like the place. The problem is we can most likely flex 2 kids in the fairly small house, but the school district is very poor. We want our children to have a good education, so moving is important. But it is going to AT LEAST double our mortgage payment, probably 2.5x to get to a house in a good part of town. I also want to maintain saving for retirement, but with a higher mortgage that would also have to cut back a good bit too. 

I guess I'm asking, should I risk waiting a couple years to see how interest rates change? Should I pull the trigger on looking when I see interest rate 3.x? Obviously I have a bit of wiggle room, it's just a matter of timing things best I can.

I'm obviously willing to make sacrifices for my children's betterment. For those that have lived in ""bad"" vs. ""good"" school zones with kids, have you seen it be dramatically different?

We've also looked into private schools, but they are fairly expensive it seems. It looks pretty unlikely that we would come out ahead financially not moving and paying for private school. Wife isn't interested in home-schooling much.

Exchange your chainlink for makers governance token and lend it to someone for their ethereum so you can stake it for ethereum 2.0. 

Or, take your bitcoin and wrap it so you can loan it to someone for dai so you can exchange it for uniswap governance tokens! 

Are you serious? The only value any of these coins and defi protocols could possibly have is the fact that they are decentralized. But they all have back doors and are centralized as can be. To make matters worse, a lot of these defi projects have moved from ethereum to side chains that are even more centralized. 

It is a bunch of crap being exchanged for other crap to be loaned for other crap and somehow there are sky high interest rates for all of this loaning and staking? 

I single out ethereum just as an example, but it is happening on all of these smart contract chains. 

In a perfect world the most decentralized, secure, and scalable smart contract platform will exist, where real world companies that actually help make the world a better place will be traded on defi, but until then it is all just fairy tale land. 

I want it to succeed, but right now it is all just a bunch of people chasing the highest interest rates, knowing damn well it will all collapse.",cryptocurrency,1669916314

personalfinance,Timing the CD market with excess savings an option in my situation?,"Hey all, I want to make sure I'm not just fucking myself here on how I want to reorganize my finances. In my mid 20s.

Backstory is I've accumulated much more than an emergency fund at this point in my money market and savings accounts. This is due to: anxiety regarding my employer being, well, less than great on timely reimbursements for travel/systematic payroll management issues across the organization leading me to decide that a 12 months emergency fund is prudent, my job taking me off the grid for weeks or months at a time, some laziness, and also due to being fairly frugal. 

I've got some expenses coming up on the horizon in the next year or so -- I'll want to buy out the car I have on a lease to own program (about 30% of a years salary), a roommate situation that's likely going to mean higher rent in the immediate term, and when the lease ends a higher overall rent somewhere else.

For context, I always contribute 20% into an employer 401k with a 5% match that is 90% invested in a retirement target date fund with a minimal expense ratio, 10% passive large cap index fund/government security fund that I change allocation on based on market conditions every quarter, have an IRA I contributed the maximum to this year, and a modest taxable brokerage account (both IRA and brokerage account are about 40% stocks and passive index ETFs, 30% passive bond ETFs, and 30% SPAXX/JPST/brokered CDs)

I'm looking at the fed rate increases and their impact on the CD market . I've been lucky so far on some spikes in yields. I'm wondering if my next option, given some uncertain and certain increases in future expenses and a more than healthy personal savings/emergency fund, is to dump anything in excess of my expenses for 12 months into CDs once we see the next rate hike or 2 with a target yield of about 5.5% and target maturity of about 6months-3 years laddered to keep myself relatively liquid on some of the investment.

I fully intend on keeping a 20% contribution to my 401k, and am not opposed to making some of these CD purchases in my IRA next year if my personal expenses with rent becoming lower than I am expecting.

TL:DR: Do you think as someone in his mid 20s with some significant savings beyond 12 months of expenses, this would make sense to target yields on CDs and then invest in a 6 month-3 year ladder, or should I be chasing longer term investments and just eating the risks inherent with my employer on pay and reimbursement issues cropping up at an inopportune time with larger expenses on the horizon.",finance,1669918143

personalfinance,"Got an $11,000 pay increase, but my take home pay is only $25 more?","[SOLVED- Update at bottom] 

Hey all, 

I recently got a big promotion and started a new position making ~$10,000 more per year. I went from earning $44,000 and some change to around $55,000 and some change.  I receive some extra taxable income in the form of tuition remission to the tune of $4100 a year which may be some of the reason. I am still unsure though. 


Naturally, I was ecstatic! It was a huge jump and I was so excited to use the extra $10,000 to save. To my dismay, I got paid my first full paycheck and the net is only $25 more than at my last position. Nearly half my earnings are deducted. 


A closer look reveals that my state tax is something like 2.25x what I was paying before. My federal tax withholding went up by 3x. From about $284 a month to a whopping $859.29. 


I also owe some of these deductions to things like healthcare, parking, dental, etc. but those increases are in the 10s of dollars… 


I knew I’d probably lose some of the extra pay to taxes… but is this really correct? I feel so cheated…

My parents have both switched careers in the last few years and now make considerably more money than when I was in undergrad, so I think they wanted to help me with my school fees and student loan debt. I'm a bit overwhelmed to be receiving so much money at once, so could really use some advice on what to do with it. Here's some information about my finances: 

Debts: $50,000 in student loan debt from my recent master's and a little left over from my undergraduate degree. Importantly, my graduate student loans have a higher interest rate at 6.54%. I also have $3,500 in principal balance on my car loan (I pay $200 for this loan every month, and my car is valued at $11,000). 

Investments: $25,000 in a Fidelity 401K and $5,000 in a VTWAX individual brokerage on E-Trade. 

Other savings: $8,000 in my standard checking account

Since graduating from my master's, I have gotten several part-time contract jobs, which will total in about $80,000 annual income (maybe more). However, this does mean that I have to pay for my own healthcare, which is about $300 a month.

Apologies if this is too much information or if answers like this are posted elsewhere, but I've gotten some really great advice from this sub before and would love some help. I'm nervous about receiving so much money at once, so my first instinct is to use it to pay off my loans, but I wonder if there are better uses for it.

CryptoCurrency,"To Ponzi or not to Ponzi, that is the question.","I want to dispel confusion about what makes a digital token a Ponzi scheme. {Not financial advice.}

Expectations are the root of a lot of conflict that people experience daily. Some expectations are well founded, like the time the sun rises and sets. Some expectations are not well founded, like using a crosswalk at a busy intersection without watching all vehicles. Ponzi schemes rely on expectation.

Calling all digital tokens Ponzi schemes is not correct. In fact, none qualify as a Ponzi without effort by a scammer. A digital token has no value, except what a buyer is willing to pay. There should be no expectation of value retention. However, when words are added to the sale by which is inferred a value expectation, then there may be grounds to label it a Ponzi scheme.

*""Crypto is a retention of value.*"" Not true. Not in the fashion that most crypto is handled. There is no value preservation mechanic in the sale of crypto. When a crypto seller uses value retention as a sales pitch, it is a Ponzi scheme when the value retained is in anticipation of future buyers. The only way a crypto purchase retains value is if the exchanged value is stored somewhere for retrieval. You should be seeking detailed clarification about how value retention occurs if anyone tells you this.

""*Crypto can earn interest, and can greatly exceed fiat rates.*"" That better be part of the crypto issuance contract, because otherwise the claim is false. A common Ponzi scheme is to promise amazing interest rates - 30%, 60%, 110% annually. It is possible if the value is denominated in a hyperinflated asset. It is not possible if the value is denominated in a fairly stable asset. Ridiculously high interest rates are part of a Ponzi scheme, unless trusted sources confirm otherwise. Website moon.promise.con is not a trustworthy source. Don't fool yourself.

""*(Good) Coins can only go up in the long run.*"" Do I need to explain this? If yes, then uninstall the internet. Future price requires future buyers. That coin better have market penetrating, competition destroying, secret sauce utility.

""*Decentralization bro.*"" Problems inherent with cooperation is what decentralization means. Centralization means that force is pushing into market. Decentralization means that users pull into market. In short, decentralization requires user demand more than centralization. Your main question needs to be about demand stimulation. Why does every user need this in their wallet, and what market options lure users to part with it? Cooperatively agreed value is more risky that value certified by a central authority. Valuation is more opinion based. Willingness to exchange becomes a greater dependency. If you cannot imagine using crypto to uphold a cooperative market, then you are being sold something that depends on others imagining that value. It is a Ponzi scheme if without valid assurance that a cooperative market exists and persists for a digital currency.

Let this pushback by the centralized market leaders by your call to question what you are being sold. I am not hinting about investing in any crypto or certain crypto. I am not hinting at future market valuations. I am only encouraging people to prove to themselves that the crypto they want to shill is not a Ponzi scheme. If you cannot, because all of your beliefs are based on what JoeBlowBoogerEater said on Reddit, then be careful.",cryptocurrency,1669929793

But no matter how, if BTC was to go up to $20k nowany would be so bullish over this rise that it would be the occasional ""is the bull market back"" phase. Right now crypto articles are already starting to talk highly of a move to $17k as ""recovery"" from the FTX collapse while that is clearly not the case.

And now just look back and you will see that all of this feels just like Crypto in 2017, people are getting (or would be getting) overly bullish if we break $20k or even $25k. And that's how, ladies and gentlemen Bitcoin has just made you time-travel.

I am fine with using those tools but after I understand enough to do it myself.

Thought I would just detail it out here and ask the community communal experience if i am making mistakes by ommission or otherwise.

My salary $140k plus 7k bonus plus 5k pay adjustment = 153k for year 

Wifes salay crazily went from 75k to 90k to 125k and will probably be 150k by end of year. Lets just say its 100k for the year.

Capital gains/dividends from investments outside retirement accounts I dont know yet but lets say $20k.

We are filing jointly.

So as I understand FICA is owed on unadjusted gross on ordinary income. My income just exceeds the social security 147k limit...my wifes does not so we pay on 247k. which would be 247k × 0.062 = $15,314.

Medicare you pay 1.45% but 2.35% on anything above 250k. so 250k x 0.0145 + 3k x .0235 = $3696.

So FICA we owe $19,010.

Federal is based on taxable income not gross.

We will have contributed $40k to pretax 401k, $5k to dependant care FSA and $1k to an HSA. Other than that we take the standard deduction of $25900.

So 253k - 40k - 5k - 1k - 25.9k = $181.1k taxable.

Federal tax we would then owe 
$31,345.

We have 2 dependant children so will recieve a $4k tax credit to make that $27,135 owed.

Capital gains will be $20k × 0.15 or $3k owed.

So $19,010 + $27,135 + $3,000 = $49135 in taxes owed.

$49,135 / $273,000 = 18% taxes.

20. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

24. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US.

31. Vitalik is worried about bugs in SC code and “most worried” about hacks of ZK-Rollups. I believe it’s obvious that ETH ZK-Rollups will generally be DnPs (“deposit and pray”).

A lot of online calculators were giving various numbers.   
From what I saw online there is 15.3% for self employment tax, 24% for federal income tax, and 9.3% in California state income tax.

personalfinance,"I received $20,000+ Would like some advice on how to proceed","I recently came into a lump sum of $22,500 and would like to know where I should be putting it so I can set myself up for a good year.

Credit Card: $3,680    
Car Loan: $7,660    

No other debt. I immediately paid off my credit card leaving me with my car loan with an interest rate of 3.89%. I pay $319 a month + $5 electronic payment charge a month. This means i'll be paying this for another 24 months. 

So far, I have set aside some money for myself, this includes...

Emergency fund for 3 months: $5,000     
Tax for the lump sum 30%: $6,750    
Money set aside for personal expenses: $3,000    

This leaves me with $4,070 left in my personal savings. I currently have a savings account with an interest rate of 3%. My immediate thought goes to just putting that towards my car loan, leaving me with $3,590 and aggressively paying it off as I no longer have credit card debt, which I was paying $490 a month on. In less than 4 months i'll have it paid off.

stocks,Expected bond fund reactions to interest rate change,"I have always believed this: that bond fund prices are fairly predictable (as opposed to stock, which are mostly random) because their returns are largely based on dividends provided by the underlying bonds, which are stated up front (unlike stock prices, which do not relate to how well the company does a lot of the times). Of course there still variation like what the fund manager does and market demands etc, but in large, they are relative ""sane"", am I even right?

If I am right (kind of), assuming inflation has stopped completely. Assuming the feds has decided to not raise rate at all (these are all assumptions, for education purpose). What is the expected behavior of prices of bond funds? Are they supposed to just hold? Go up? Or keep going down just less so? I assume corperate bond funds will behave differently that those funds focused on government ones (e.g. municipal, etc). Can someone enlighten me?

personalfinance,Would you invest or pay off your mortgage?,"Hi all, I’ve been contemplating this question for quite a few months and would like to get your input. In short I have bought a house and have a mortgage of 200k with a 2.75% fixed interest for the next 40 years. I am in my early 20’s and have been investing religiously into index funds and some crypto, I now have around 40k in my portfolio. 

Originally my plan was when it comes to receiving my monthly salary:

1. Pay off the monthly mortgage
2. Set aside money for expenses for that month 
3. Set aside some fun money for myself
4. and finally, divide the remaining monthly salary into 2: stocks and mortgage, example I would have 500 left over meaning 250 goes to stocks and the other 250 goes to mortgage 

Now I have been reading other posts stating that when having a low interest rate especially during inflation, it makes no sense to pay off more from the mortgage and financially it is better to place it all in an investment portfolio. As on average you get about 6% return from stock market. 

So from a financial perspective, what is your take on this? 

I have always thought that ideally the mortgage is paid off as soon as possible, however I’m not quite sure now",finance,1669980065

My loan was for 30,000 with a down payment of 10,000 at 6.6% interest for 72months. Not ideal for a car I know. 

Today, this loan stands at about 26,100 and I’m able to pay the full amount back. 

I was told it’s better to keep the loan for the length of time to build a history since I don’t have any major loan history at all. Some others tell me to pay it all back as soon as I can because of the medium-high interest rate. 

I’m wondering if I should pay the loan back almost all the way and keep 6,000 on it for the rest of the term and perhaps negotiate a better monthly cost, but that would require re-financing and my credit score would take a hit, etc etc. 

Others tell me to forget the loan entirely and reinvest that amount into something better. What that something is, I don’t know entirely yet lol. 

Any recommendations?

1. Save an E-Fund for at least 3-6 months, i might have been a bit too hasty to pay this off immediately

I'm truly disgusted by how the government / people are treating this FTX scandal. First, SBF was given a standing ovation when he talked with the New York Times reporter (which btw is a shit completely politically slanted publication now). Then you have the U.S. House Committee on Financial Services chair, Maxine Walters, telling SBF how much they appreciate SBF's willingness to talk and basically praising him. You also have SBF liking tweets on Twitter making fun of the whole situation and how people lost their money.

SBF should be in a god damned cell right now along with his cronies. Not being given standing ovations or able to still tweet from some luxury home in the Bahamas.

The US government, other governments, and these other news agencies should be ashamed of how they handled this situation. They have no understanding of cryptocurrency or what FTX even is and it shows.

personalfinance,Capital Gains and RSUs/ESPP -- what is the big deal?,"Bit of a rant below--apologies if my thoughts aren't totally clear. But I am having trouble understanding why I should care so much about capital gains. 

My company issues RSUs that mature at a rate of 1/3 a year. Once they mature, my company takes a portion of stocks out as taxes. So if I am to understand this correctly, I were to sell right away, I'd only owe taxes on the gains.

The stock, like many stocks lately, has barely moved. It's a stock with a lot of upside--forecasted as a ""buy"" with a target about $40 per share higher than it is now. But it's been in that status for 2-3 years now, and with an economy that has basically stopped making any sense, and a pending recession (or not), that seems unlikely to change. Regardless, it seems strikingly obvious to cash out and, at a minimum, let this ride in a HYSA (currently mine is at 3.25%).

But even if I didn't, theoretically, I still fail to see the big deal in ""capital gains"". If I have 200 shares, and the stock goes up $3. That's a $600 appreciation on my portfolio. I'm aware that the difference between capital gains and short-term gains (if I were to hold these another year) is about 15%, but if the stock barely moves, that's a difference of, what, a couple hundred bucks? And that's assuming it doesn't plummet. 

Considering the pending threat of recession, at face value, it appears to me the most clear choice here is to cash out and take full advantage of the ridiculous interest rates in savings. 

I'm hashing all this out because everyone I talk to about this gets wide-eyed when I discuss selling immediately. My boss, in particular, always warns me ""I hope you're holding onto those for at least a year... you don't want to pay capital gains!"" But when I look at the math, for a stock that's barely moving, that I've already paid taxes on, I'm really struggling to see why it's such a big deal especially in such a volatile market. For capital gains to even be a concern (meaning, beyond just a few hundred bucks in difference between capital gains and short term gains), the stock would have to catapult over the next year.

Is it really that simple or am I misunderstanding? I just don't see the upside to holding onto $50,000 in a single stock that's barely budged.",finance,1670002169

personalfinance,Income increase: Okay to prioritize retirement over debt?,"I recently (\~6 wks ago) started a job making $65/hr (\~133k/year). Prior to that I was a PhD student with no taxable income. My spouse makes $90k per year. We are in our mid-/late-40s, own our home and have three children.

I'll put all my numbers below, but the tldr; version is that I am behind on my retirement contributions (because grad school), but we also have a bit of debt (because grad school). My inclination is to prioritize the retirement, but I want to get a second opinion or two. **I am familiar with the flow chart** and it's a great resource, but I think **tax implications** make its recommendations less appropriate for me right now.

I set up my pay to have very little taxes held out for the rest of this year, but to withhold 80% for (unmatched) 401k as soon as I was eligible: So I had three weeks of $2000/wk paychecks but now are down to \~$250. My new job is currently an hourly, 9-month contracting position (hence no 401k match) but there's a strong possibility of transitioning to a permanent direct hire (\~150k/yr) early in 2023. So our household income is likely to be *way* higher next year than in previous years, and I would like to save as much as possible —and shield as much as possible from taxes— both this year and next. We can mostly live off my spouse's income and have almost all mine going towards financial goals.

So my plan is:

1. Get as close as possible to maxing out my 401k for 2022. I should have about $15,850 contributed by the end of the year.
2. After the first of the year, adjust contributions for both my spouse and I so that they're maxed out by the end of 2023. (Both of us have good, low-expense 401k plans)
3. Invest the maximum in an IRA for both my spouse and I (=12,000) early in 2023, to count towards 2022. (I can do that, right? I've never actually done IRA contributions before so am a little fuzzy on it.)
4. Pay off high-interest debt.
5. Build up emergency fund to 2mo expenses (\~10k)
6. Pay off low-interest debt (except mortgage and 0% loan)
7. Max IRA contributions for 2023
8. Open taxable investment accounts

Does that sound like a good plan? Is there anything I'm overlooking? (I've never really made enough money to have to think much about tax implications before!)

**EDIT**: I seem to be getting a lot of knee-jerk reactions (""credit card debt is bad, must pay off credit cards first"") without any consideration of the tax implications. The way I figure it, if I use $9,000 of extra income this year to pay off debt, it will mean **an extra $2,160 of federal taxes** (24% marginal tax rate). If I put in in a 401k, on the other hand, I'll pay \~$93/month in interest on the credit card for a few months until I pay it off.

**\*\*\*\*\*If you are recommending that I prioritize paying off debt, please tell me how my calculation here is wrong and otherwise how it affects my taxes.\*\*\*\*\***

CryptoCurrency,4 Reasons Why Real Estate Tokenisation Will Never Work,"There have been perhaps hundreds or even thousands of attempts to tokenize real estate, yet none of these projects has taken off. So I thought to put down my thoughts on this subject since I know how many people are interested in this.

Yes, there are a few examples of semi-success with tokenisation like Lofty or Realt but the success is nowhere near where their ambition was when they started.

The are four main problems:

**1. Tokenization offers no real benefits compared to REITs**

I know, governance can be better and token holders have the power to oust bad managers however at what cost? Managing a large fund benefits from economies of scale versus managing one property. Moreover, REITs are publicly traded and thus they also have protections for shareholders.

Another point is that REITs offer deeper liquidity in secondary markets and thus better price discovery. Tokenized properties are too small, sometimes as small as $200k and it can even be easier to sell a whole property than sell tokens of a property. REITs don't have any of these problems.

**2. Tokenization is not scalable**

For every property that is tokenized a limited company must be formed as an intermediate layer. It is this limited company that is actually tokenized and not the property itself. This comes from government law that doesn't allow tokenized properties. Moreover, every state in the US has their own separate laws. You need to get a licence for every state you operate in.

**3. Managing tokenized property is expensive**

Managing tokenized properties scattered across different cities, states and countries is a nightmare. You need to employ local managers and 10-15% of your rental income goes to them.

**4. You cannot use leverage or take mortgage with tokenized properties**

One of the reasons real estate has produced so much wealth for many people is leverage. When I take a mortgage with a 10% deposit, in effect I am 10x levered. So as an example, if I put down a $10k deposit for a property worth $100k, if house prices go up by 10% to $110k, my profit is $10k or 100% on the money I put in, versus 10% profit if I had bought the whole property without a mortgage. Even for REITs, you can use margin to buy funds with interest rates as low as 5% on Interactive Brokers. That's something you can't do with tokenized properties.

**What do you think?**

Edit: Maybe I was not clear that I am not against crypto + real estate applications. In fact I am currently working on a project that does that https://www.realblock.fi, however I believe that tokenisation have many issues that I wanted to address.",cryptocurrency,1670008801

personalfinance,Debt Consolidation advice,"Hello, I’m new here but looking for advice. I have about 10k in CC debt. Its not crippling, I will eventually pay it down but projecting out the cost with interest over the length of time it will take to pay down is unpleasant at best.

My question is about debt consolidation services. I understand the idea, take out a loan, pay off your cards, get a better interest rate, etc…

I started to research options and there’s a billion. They all seem shady, they all seem predatory, i have no idea how to separate the good from the bad. I spoke to one representative and they were just reading a script…

Does anyone have experience or advice on this topic? Am I missing anything important?

CryptoCurrency,Why use stablecoins instead of fiat money?,"After seeing how many de-pegs we had this year, I honestly don't see why someone would leave any amount in any stablecoin (sc).

I understand that having them facilitates trades, makes it easier to use DEXs, DAOs, mixers and such. But from a risk-based perspective, wouldn't it be easier to just use fiat when one wants to buy other tokens/coins?

Thinking about the hardness of fiat and stablecoins, both are equally worthless and backed by thin air. We don't trust e.g. Tether more than we trust the FED. I don't even know which one we trust less. However, the dollar in its fiat format somewhat passes more trust to me, since the government backs it with economic measures, men with guns etc. If the fiat dollar collapses, society will still be here and the goods produced until then will be here as well. If Tether collapses, there will be no piece of the company left, nor any goods, since they don't produce any.

Of course I'm an average investor: I send fiat to a CEX, buy my tokens and withdraw them right away. I don't dab with DAOs, leverage and such, things that people generally use stablecoins for.

So my question is: is the kind of strategy you adopt in your investments the driving factor when deciding between fiat and scs? Do you people see any other use for these other than what I've just said?

In other words: do people use them just because it's easier than having to transfer fiat every time one wants to buy?

politics,Richard Wolff: The Fed’s response to inflation is another upward transfer of wealth,,finance,1670017044
Bitcoin,Conversing with a Fed advisor about Bitcoin,"A friend of mine is a well-known finance professor and advises the Fed.  We hang out once a year for a few hours, but never discussed Bitcoin.  He has always thought it is trash, worthless, useless.  

We hung out last week and he was interested this time in discussing Bitcoin.  It didn't really get anywhere, but I probably didn't do the best job in defending Bitcoin.  The fact that he is a very prominent finance professor didn't make it easy.

Today he sent me an opinion piece written by Paul Krugman that just came out yesterday which basically declares crypto to be dead.  Yet again.  Ths time I can gather my thoughts properly before responding, but I thought I would share them here in case anyone has any comments on my response that could be helpful:

""Thank you for sending me this article.  I hate to parrot the same type of talking points that Krugman hears, but I do believe that Krugman ""doesn't get it"".  More to the point, though: no-one has explained it to him, because what is written in his article is mostly unrelated to what ""enthusiasts"" would talk about.

First, forget about anything non-Bitcoin.  Second, and the main point: Inflation is, generally speaking and in the last 100 years, a horrible thing.  If inflation comes about from positive economic activity, then fine.  But if you sum up all of the inflation over the last 100 years in the USA, I am guessing it has been a huge negative on overall society.  This is a claim that I am making, unverified (by me).  If I am wrong about this, then I am very misinformed and **would gladly relinquish a lot of my support for Bitcoin**.

Inflation is **the main** problem that bitcoin is trying to solve.  Satoshi Nakomoto probably said it best in as few words as possible:

""The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work.  The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.  Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve.  We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts.  Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.""

Satoshi's #1 point above is about the debasing of fiat currencies.  His #2 point is fractional reserve lending.  Why is fractional reserve lending a problem?  Seems to have worked all these years.  Except that it hasn't, and in 2008 the banks had to be bailed out, with us taxpayers footing the bill in the short term and the long term.

You will notice that Krugman's article states nothing about the above.  And that's why he ""doesn't get it"".

This is what Bitcoin is all about.  But the most natural follow-up question is: How does Bitcoin solve the above problems?  Why Bitcoin?  Why not rocks or seashells or stuffed animals?  That is another conversation.""

personalfinance,Is high interest actually the time to buy?,"So I live in Portland, OR, which has had a very difficult and expensive real estate market for at least the past decade. Recently I've started wondering if - in that environment - some of my real estate assumptions have been mistaken.

As interest rates have gone up over the last year, home prices have gone down in response, because nobody could possibly afford the payments on the inflated prices at these interest rates. If you want to sell your house at all, you have to sell for less.

Now I've always thought that high interest rates were a bad time to buy. But in the Portland market, any dip in interest rates is met with a dramatic increase in demand. So the asking prices are inevitably much higher. *So* much higher that the monthly mortgage payments pretty much always wash out.

For example, a house that sells for $(595,000.00 - 20% downpayment) today with an interest rate of 6.50% would cost you \~$120k upfront and \~$3,300/month (+/- property tax, which is pretty high here). But if the rates drop *a lot*, say to 4.5% (which they maybe never will again), the same house will easily sell here for $(700,000.00 - 20%). Which has the same monthly mortgage cost, but costs \~$140k upfront.

**So here's my question**. If you're going to have the same monthly payment either way, I think that the former situation is better, right? Because with interest rates there are two possible outcomes:

1. The rates go up from here. If this happens, I'll be glad I bought now.
2. The rates go down from here. If this happens, I'll refinance and get the lower rates anyway.

So there's really no losing from the perspective of interest rates. But from the perspective of the initial downpayment there are also two possible outcomes:

1. The asking prices go up from here. If this happens, I'll be glad I bought now. Because I'll get to pay much less cash up-front for the same monthly payment.
2. The asking prices go down from here. If this happens, my upfront cost is lower, but also the competition will be brutal, potentially eating every desirable house at any price.

So the pascal square looks like this:

|What will happen in the future?|Rates Up|Rates Down|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Asking Prices Up|**Buy now**, everything only gets worse|**Buy now**, save cash and refinance later, no big deal.|
|Asking Price Down|**Buy now**, save cash and get a good rate now. Best case.|This is impossible outside of a massive crash in a major market.|

What am I missing? With the rates so high and everyone so spooked, it also makes the buying experience completely different. For years I've been fighting people to get in the door of even the least attractive open houses. Lately I've been the only soul, and the agents are begging me to make an offer.",finance,1670017568

gaming,This has been the worst year for new games that I can remember in a long time,"With Callisto Project coming out as a buggy mess that’s really short I feel like that this year has been nonstop bad games. I feel like there’s more unfinished games this year than completed ones. 

Gotham Knights, MW2, Overwatch “2”, Pokémon Scarlet/Violet, Saints Row, Fifa 23, just all off the top of my head. Bottom feeder games right there. 

And sure this is on me but I haven’t enjoyed the games people say are best this year either. 

Not because I’m a noob, love that I gotta clarify that, but I couldn’t get into Elden Ring (played Demon Souls &amp; Dark Souls before Elden Ring this year and enjoyed them a lot). And I know saying you don’t like this game is like posting cringe on main but I tried so hard to enjoy it, I put 15 hours into it but I just couldn’t. 

It was always running below 60fps and it was stuttering/lagging on my PS5. If a single player game lags on the PS5 it’s the games problem not the console. The sounds were noticeably dull and I felt like I was being railroaded through the open world. Why make an open world game if you want players to explore it in a specific way?? Why punish players for exploring by not setting up Grace sites off the beaten path?? 

And I didn’t get Horizon Forbidden West because I didn’t like the first one. Same with the God of War sequel, I could just never get into those games (I first tried God of War 3 all the way back on the PS3 and never cared for it, same with the 2018 remake). So people enjoying those games, I’m glad you are! Got nothing against those just not me.

And Midnight Sun’s seems like just a glorified card game I got no interest in that either. And I didn’t get TLOU part 1 cause no way I’m spending $70 on a remaster. 

Yeah I know this post won’t go over well cause I’m saying bad things about basically every game that came out this year (I liked Stray and Stanley Parable Ultra Deluxe is my personal GOTY for 2022) but I am kinda fed up with the gaming industry releasing dud after dud and need to rant a little.

personalfinance,Tax Credit General Question,"I would like to understand whether a tax credit applies to my entire year's federal tax due, or only to the amount of federal tax payment remaining, from my income tax submission.

Example, say i owe $20,000 for 2022 tax year. And, I'm eligible for a tax credit of 5,000 (why doesn't matter, assume EV credit). Assume tax credit is of the nonrefundable type.

Scenario #1:
Over the course of 2022 my employer takes out $20,000 in federal tax.  When I complete my tax return I owe $0 in federal tax.  Because the tax credit is non-refundable, is my tax credit worthless?

Scenario #2 (underpayment during the year)
Over the course of 2022 my employer takes out $15,000 in federal tax but i still owe the same $20,000.  Without the credit, i need to pay the remaining $5,000 tax due.  However, i still have that $5,000 tax credit.  So, after I complete my tax return I owe $0 in federal tax.

My question really is... In order to take advantage of the tax credit do I need to underpay my estimated federal tax due throughout the year so that I'm in scenario 2 instead of scenario #1? 

Do I lose the tax credit unless I have a balance due when I submit my tax return?

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq end Friday lower after November jobs report; indexes notch weekly gains - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks cut much of their earlier losses Friday as investors looked past hotter-than-expected labor data to the upcoming Federal Reserve meeting.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up just 34.87 points, or 0.1%, to 34,429.88 points after hitting a session low of more than 350 points down. The S&amp;P 500 dipped 0.1% to 4,071.70, rebounding from an earlier loss of 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite also made up ground to end nearly 0.2% lower at 11,461.50 points. The tech-heavy index dropped as much as 1.6% earlier in the day.
*****
&gt; All three indexes set weekly gains, with the Nasdaq posting the largest increase at nearly 2.1%. The S&amp;P 500 added 1.1%, and the Dow ticked up by 0.2%. Friday’s close marked the first time the three major indexes notched back-to-back weekly gains since October.
*****
&gt; Stocks dipped after labor data released Friday morning showed payrolls rose by 263,000 in November, a bigger gain than the 200,000 increase expected by economists polled by Dow Jones. Average hourly earnings also came in above expectations, jumping 0.6% compared with the prior month and 5.1% against the same month a year ago. The unemployment rate held steady at 3.7%.
*****
&gt; The market quelled much of those losses as the trading day went on. Market observers attributed the move to investors being increasingly able to shake off concerning individual economic indicators following remarks on Wednesday from Fed Chair Jerome Powell that appeared to confirm slowing rate hikes starting as early as December.
*****
&gt; “Just one strong labor data point is not going to be enough after Powell’s speech,” said Anna Han, vice president at Wells Fargo Securities. “He’s confirming that we are seeing the trend that we are having an impact on inflation, so I think that sort of soothes the market and takes pressure off.”
*****
&gt; It was the final monthly employment report before the Fed’s two-day meeting Dec. 13-14, in which the central bank is expected to slow to a 50 basis point interest rate hike from the 75 basis point hikes seen in recent months.

&gt; # S&amp;P Down Year-To-Date November Not So Bad for December

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/bd27a1ab99c3a122fd055c369cb12cf7/378af1d4ed5f33f3-99/s500x750/1909a4cfe63b634b8e837a88ef1087914fe19c28.jpg))**

&gt; There was a stat floating around the internet and business news channels this week that stated when the S&amp;P 500 was down 15% or more year-to-date (YTD) on November 30 December was down &gt;2% on average. We ran the numbers yesterday before the big rally on Fed Chair Powell’s “makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases” comments yesterday at the Brookings Institute.

&gt; What we found was that most of the carnage after November YTD losses &gt; 15% occurred in the Great Depression years and since WWII December has performed much better after a down &gt;15% YTD November. During the Depression after these November YTD &gt;15% losses December was down 3 of 4 with an average loss of -5.4%. In the six years since 1939 with these November YTD &gt;15% losses December was up 3, down 3 with an average loss of -0.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/52fe73e880d4b03c9d22097ab3b03bce/378af1d4ed5f33f3-6e/s500x750/717db2ae4761c602f16357ba1801b4633c0d1490.jpg))**

&gt; But with the big 3.1% gain in the S&amp;P 500 on November 30, the YTD loss receded above the -15% mark to -14.4% on the heels of a 5.4% gain for the month, which is also a 14.1 percent rally off the October 12 low. And this marks the first back-to-back monthly gains of over 5% each month since August 2020, the ones before that were in March-May 2009. It’s the 14th such occurrence since 1950. The previous 13 all occurred in bull markets.

&gt; Now, when the S&amp;P 500 is down YTD November less than 15%, December’s performance is not so bad at all, just a tad below the average 1.6% to 1.1%, up 17 of 23 or 74% of the time. We still expect some chop as the bull market finds its footing, but we remain bullish and anticipate the yearend rally to continue to climb the proverbial “wall of worry” and for the Santa Claus Rally to come to town.

&gt; # Country ETFs Outperforming US Recently

&gt; For most major global equity markets, at some point this Fall a 52-week low has been put in place, with significant rallies since then. As shown below, of the 22 ETFs tracking key country stock markets in our Global Macro Dashboard, the average gain off the low is now 22%. The largest of these rallies have come from Germany (EWG), Italy (EWI), and China (MCHI), which have all risen over 30%. For China, that gain has come in the shortest span of time with October 31st being its low, whereas Italy and Germany's lows were a few weeks further back. One other interesting note regarding China is currently it trades only slightly above its 50-DMA whereas a majority of other country ETFs are in or at least near overbought territory. On the other end of the spectrum, the US (SPY) has experienced the most modest rally having only risen 13.82%. India (INDA) is close behind with a 13.89% gain, although it bottomed before the rest of the world with its 52-week low being back on June 17th.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120122-GMD-1.png))**

&gt; While much of the rest of the world has experienced a larger rebound off the lows, year to date performance between the US (SPY) and global equities excluding the US—proxied by the MSCI All World ex. US ETF (CWI)—is now very similar. The US is marginally in the lead with a -14.12% YTD total return versus a 14.45% drop for CWI. At the lows at the end of Q3, international markets were underperforming the US by more than 5 percentage points, but that gap has been closed during the current rally.

&gt; # Five Good Signs for The Bulls In 2023

&gt; Can you believe it? We made it to December! As we noted yesterday, we wouldn’t be surprised if we finished this year with some more green, but today we’ll look into the future and what could be in store in 2023.

&gt; First things first, let’s start with something simple. Stocks will likely be lower this year; we can all agree there. How likely is the S&amp;P 500 to be down two years in a row? The bottom line, it is pretty rare for back-to-back yearly losses, and we don’t expect it to happen this time either. In fact, over the past 50 years, it has only happened twice. There was a three-year losing streak after the tech bubble burst in 2000, 2001, and 2002, then back-to-back losses during the vicious recession of 1973 and 1974. So it ‘could’ happen, but we don’t see many similarities between now and those two times, suggesting next year should be a bounce-back year for stocks.

&gt; Another potential positive is that when the S&amp;P 500 is lower during a midterm year (like we will likely see in 2022), the following year has been extremely strong. Since 1950, the year after a negative midterm year saw the S&amp;P 500 higher all eight times, with a very impressive yearly return of 24.6%. Looking at the past 50 years, things are even better, as the ‘worst’ next year was 26.3%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture1.png))**

&gt; Thirdly, and somewhat similar to above, pre-election years historically are very strong for stocks, with the S&amp;P 500 up 16.8% on average and higher 88.9% of the time. Midterm years are the worst, which clearly played out this year. All in all, that’s something for bulls to be excited about in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture2-800x407.png))**

&gt; Fourth, we hear a lot about how a recession is coming in 2023, but we aren’t so sure. Sonu did a great job discussing some of this here and here.

&gt; The bottom line to us is that the consumer makes up 70% of the economy, and is still in good shape and spending. But could a recession start next year? Well, history would say it would be rare. That’s right, we found that out of the past 13 recessions, none started in a pre-election year. Full disclosure, we did see recessions begin in January in 1970 and 2008, so those were just a month away. But all in all, this is another potential positive for the bulls in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture3.png))**

&gt; Lastly, stocks soared yesterday as investors realize that the Fed will likely end their series of aggressive rate hikes potentially quite soon. As a result of yesterday’s big move, the S&amp;P 500 closed above its 200-day moving average for the first time in more than seven months. We took a look, and this could be potentially quite bullish.

&gt; As you can see here, previous times that saw streaks end at least six months beneath the 200-day moving average resulted in solid performance going forward. In fact, since 1950, only one out of 13 times stocks went on to make new lows, which was in 2002.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Picture4.png))**

&gt; Here are the longest streaks beneath the 200-day moving average and what happened once the streak ended. Up 18.8% a year later and higher more than 92% of the time is one thing that could have bulls smiling in 2023.

&gt; # Will Santa Bring Jolly or Coal to Investors This December?

&gt; Can you believe it? We’ve made it to the last month of the year! I don’t know about you all, but I’ll be pretty happy to wish 2022 goodbye as soon as possible. But the good news is that we continue to think the mid-October lows were the lows from the bear market, and continued good times could be coming. I’ll break down some positive signs tomorrow on the blog, but today I’ll show why there’s a chance Santa will come to town and bring some green with him this December.

&gt; First things first, December is historically known as one of the best months for investors, and this is true. Only once did the S&amp;P 500 see December turn out to be the worst month of the year. That was in 2018 when the Fed made one rate hike too many, and investors weren’t very festive about things, sending December down a record 9.2%.

&gt; As the chart shows below, December is still up over the past ten years (so including that massive drop in 2018), and that is mainly because the past three years, this final month has gained 2.9%, 3.7%, and 4.4%, respectively. Looking further, it ranks as the third-best month since 1950, with only April and November better. In fact, until 2018, this month was historically the best. Lastly, in a midterm year, October is the best month, November is the second best, and December is the third best.

&gt; Some other things to know:
&gt; * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.
&gt; * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
&gt; * Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.
&gt; * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&amp;P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.
&gt; * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

&gt; The bottom line is that with inflation likely peaking, the U.S. dollar weakening, positive seasonals, a potentially more dovish Fed, investors still extremely bearishly positioned (bullish from a contrarian point of view), broadening overall market participation, a stronger than expected consumer, and crude oil back to near flat for the year, there are many former headwinds, which have now become potential tailwinds. When all is said and done with 2022, we wouldn’t be surprised to see this year end higher than where it is today.

&gt; # A Popular Recession Indicator is Flashing Bright Red. Should We Worry?

&gt; A political strategist once said that if there were reincarnation, he would want to come back as the bond market. “You can intimidate everybody,” as he put it. With good reason, investors watch bond markets carefully for all sorts of signals about the economy, monetary policy, and inflation.

&gt; And right now, a key signal from the bond market – the yield curve – is flashing bright red, warning about impending recession. The yield curve is simply a curve showing interest rates on US treasury bonds across various maturities. Yields on the short end of the curve, i.e., smaller maturities, typically rise and fall depending on what investors expect the Federal Reserve (Fed) to do over the next year or two. Interest rates on the long end of the curve, with maturities of 5 years or more, are typically higher than those on the short end. If investors anticipate higher growth and inflation, they will demand much higher interest rates, widening the “spread” of difference between short and long-term yields.

&gt; In extreme cases, we get inverted yield curves, with short-term rates higher than long-term rates. This normally does not make intuitive sense since it implies that long-term investors, who face more uncertainty and risk, are settling for less compensation than short-term investors. It typically happens when the Fed raises interest rates to prevent overheating of an economy (like they have this year), while bond market investors kind of take the opposing view – believing that the Fed will go too far and push the economy into recession, which would be accompanied by much lower inflation and hence, lower long-term yields.

&gt; The yield curve inverted prior to the last ten recessions, with just one false signal in 1965. The table below shows yield curve inversions (as defined by the 10-year/1-year spread turning negative), along with the timing of the recession that followed. No surprise that this is a favored recession indicator.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-yield-curve-inversions-table-800x679.png))**

&gt; The chart below shows how the 10-year/1-year spread has gone negative prior to the shaded bars, i.e., recessions. The bad news is that this spread inverted back in July of this year and is currently at its most negative, or “inverted state,” since 1982. Indicating a recession is on the horizon if you consider the historical precedent.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-picture-yield-spread-602x800.png))**

&gt; # What does it really tell us, beyond “Yes, Recession”
&gt; One thing you notice from the table and chart above is that while a recession has followed inversion, the degree of inversion doesn’t say anything about the following:
&gt; * When a recession will start – the start time has varied from 7 to 24 months
&gt; * How long the recession will last – we had prolonged recessions in 1974 and 2008, and the degree of inversion was quite different prior to these
&gt; * How deep the recession will be – the degree of inversion was similar prior to the 2001 and 2008 recessions, but these were very different economic drawdowns
&gt; Another huge caveat I would add to the track record: the inversion in 2019 technically preceded the 2020 recession, but it didn’t really “predict” it in that it didn’t predict Covid-19.

&gt; Also, the yield curve has a bit of a dubious record outside the US, as this study from the St. Louis Federal Reserve points out. Several yield curve inversions occurred in the U.K. and Canada that did not predate recessions, i.e., you had a lot of false signals. But it worked better in the US, France, and Germany.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-st-louis-fed-study-inversions-800x575.png))**

&gt; # A symptom rather than a cause
&gt; Yield curve inversion is more of a symptom rather than a cause. The logic is that the Fed tightening too far leads to an expectation of slower economic growth (or recession), which leads to lower inflation expectations (there’s less demand for goods and services). Which in turn results in long-term yields falling below short-term yields. To a first approximation, long-term yields are simply the expected path of future short-term rates, i.e., monetary policy. And so, if inflation is expected to be lower in the future, especially amidst a recession, you would expect the Fed to reduce rates.

&gt; Note that higher rates can take their toll on the economy. For example, housing activity can decline amid higher mortgage rates, and businesses may cut back on spending/hiring if they find borrowing terms to be much higher. But these usually occur only with a lag – which is why a recession doesn’t follow immediately after the Fed raises rates and yield curves invert.

&gt; # Look toward inflation expectations
&gt; With respect to yield curve inversions, a lot of it comes down to inflation expectations. Inflation expectations can fall if investors expect a recession.

&gt; But, longer-term inflation expectations can also be lower than short-term inflation expectations if inflation has surged recently and investors believe it to be a short-term phenomenon. Sound familiar?

&gt; It’s not easy to directly gauge inflation expectations, but we can calculate them using securities called inflation swaps. Without getting into too much detail, these are used to transfer inflation risk from one entity to another. You have swaps ranging over various periods, e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 years, which can tell you what investors expect inflation to average over these periods.

&gt; The chart below shows 1-year inflation expectations versus 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectations. The latter is the inflation expectation over the 9-year period that begins one year from now – my goal is to separate short-term inflation expectations from longer-term expectations. As you can see, 1-year inflation expectations surged above longer-term expectations over the past 18-20 months. Prior to 2021, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation was mostly above the 1-year. But they’re converging again, with investors expecting inflation to average about 2.7% over the next year. At the same time, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is just under 2.6%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Blog-2022-11-29-inflation-expectations-592x800.png))**

&gt; What also comes out of the graph is that during the 2008 and 2020 recessions, 1-year inflation expectations collapsed well below the longer-term series. Based on that, it doesn’t look like markets are expecting a recession now.
&gt; * 1-year inflation expectations are still slightly above the 1-year/9-year forward inflation expectation
&gt; * 1-year/9-year expectations have barely fallen, in contrast to what we saw in 2008 and 2020 when they were below 2%
&gt; Could we be headed for stagflation, i.e., a recession with high inflation? Well, the 1-year/9-year forward expectation is around 2.6% right now – it doesn’t exactly scream stagflation, let alone high inflation.

&gt; To wrap up, the yield curve may be as inverted as it is today because the Fed is hiking short-term rates even as long-term yields fall on the back of lower inflation expectations – in a sense vindicating the rate hikes. However, there are other factors, including a reversal of supply-chain-related issues that pushed inflation higher in the first place. My colleague, Ryan Detrick, and I have written quite a lot about why we think inflation is off the boil (see here and here).

&gt; And just as important, inflation expectations beyond a year are not pointing toward a deflationary recession or stagflation, for that matter.

&gt; Of course, investors could be wrong, and things could change in a hurry. This is something I’ll be watching closely.

&gt; # Typical December Seasonal Pattern Begins Dull Pops Mid-Month

&gt; December’s first trading day has been bearish for S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 over the last 21 years. A modest rally through the fifth or sixth trading day also has fizzled going into mid-month. It is around this point that holiday cheer tends to kick in and propel the indexes higher with a pause near month-end.

&gt; Small caps tend to start to outperform larger caps near the middle of the month (early January Effect, 2023 Almanac pages 112 &amp;114). The January Effect is not to be confused with the January Barometer (2023 Almanac page 18), which states as the S&amp;P 500 goes in January, so goes the year.

&gt; The “Santa Claus Rally” begins on the open on December 23 and lasts until the second trading day of 2023. Average S&amp;P 500 gains over this seven trading-day range since 1969 are a respectable 1.3%. The “Santa Claus Rally,” (2023 STA p 118) was invented and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 in the Almanac.

&gt; This is our first indicator for the market in the New Year. Years when the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) has failed to materialize are often flat or down. As Yale Hirsch’s now famous line states, “If Santa Claus should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; # December #2 Small Cap #3 Large Cap Tepid Start Solid Finish

&gt; Trading in December is holiday-inspired and fueled by a buying bias throughout the month. However, the first part of the month tends to be weaker as tax-loss selling and yearend portfolio restructuring begins.

&gt; December is the number three S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrials month since 1950, averaging gains of 1.5% and 1.6% respectively. It’s the second-best Russell 2000 (1979) month and fourth best for NASDAQ (1971). It is also the third best month for Russell 1000 (1979).

&gt; In 2018, DJIA suffered its worst December performance since 1931 and its fourth worst December going all the way back to 1901. However, the market rarely falls precipitously in December and a repeat of 2018 does not seem highly likely this year.

&gt; When December is down it is usually a turning point in the market—near a top or bottom. If the market has experienced fantastic gains leading up to December, stocks can pullback in the first half of the month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/622df92caae1f1d36246081b8c04ec3f/19c407a38165e76c-b2/s400x600/a5ece9d71341061ea8853d22d94d38c5b51b9519.jpg))**

&gt; In the last eighteen midterm years, December’s rankings slip modestly to #5 DJIA (0.9%), #3 S&amp;P 500 (1.2%) and #7 NASDAQ (–0.3% since 1974). Small caps, measured by the Russell 2000, also tend to soften in midterm Decembers. Since 1982, the Russell 2000 has lost ground just three times in ten midterm years in December. The average small cap gain in all ten years is 0.3%. Midterm December performance had been stronger prior to previously mentioned December 2018.

personalfinance,"ON, Canada - Landlord facing foreclosure - what can I do?","Forgive me for not knowing all the correct terminology to explain this, I am fairly unequipped to handle this situation.

&amp;#x200B;

About 6 months ago my mom bought a new house and gave me the option to move in and pay rent. I moved into the new house and signed a lease for 5 years. Something changed with interest rates from the time the house was purchased and when the move happened, and the mortgage skyrocketed to double the predicted/expected cost. It is now unaffordable, while trying to explore her options, my mom has defaulted on her mortgage payments, and the mortgage company is threatening foreclosure.

&amp;#x200B;

The three of us living in the home are all disabled and this situation has got us all terrified for the future.

&amp;#x200B;

I am trying to find out how I can protect myself in this situation as moving with short notice like this is unrealistic. I did sign a lease however and I am researching how I might be protected under tenant law. 

&amp;#x200B;

This is where you guys come in, because I have no idea what I'm doing and could use any advice you could give. What do I do in this position? Is there anything I can do as a tenant to stop the foreclosure? Should I get a lawyer?

personalfinance,Looking for help on how to handle my current financial situation,"Howdy everyone and thanks ahead of time for any help that anyone can provide. Before I get to my questions here are the basics of my financial situation:

Just started a new position working as a pilot on a corporate jet.

Base Salary year one: $150,000

Hourly flight bonus: $75 per flight hour (we should do 300-400 hours this year)

Conservatively this puts the total for the year $172,500.

Currently the only benefits I have to pay for out of pocket are upgraded dental @$10.50 biweekly and short term disability @$16.33 biweekly. Health insurance and everything else is 100% employer paid. I also rent and my half of rent is $1000 a month. Other bills are ~$400 total (car, insurance, phone, internet). 

I have around $45,000 in a savings account currently and ~10,000 in my 401k as I just was able to start making contributions a few months ago. My employer matches 100% up to 6% and I am contributing 6% currently.

This is going to be a large pay jump for me by around $70,000 per year and I’m trying to figure out how to best use this money to set up for the future. 

Currently I owe ~$45,000 still in loans from flight school (down from around 83,000 two years ago). I had been paying this off aggressively but am considering making minimum payments so that I can put more money in to my 401k. The interest rate on the loan is 2.49% so my thought process was that the average annual return of a 401k should hypothetically outpace the interest rate of the loan. Is this thinking accurate? For example - would it be better to put an extra $200 biweekly in to the 401k or put it towards the loan? 

Another thing that I can’t seem to figure out is if I should be making my 401k contributions pre or post tax. Given my current income I am unsure as to which would be better from a tax perspective down the road. 


Overall I am just getting started really in my professional career and want to get started on my finances as soon as I can. Any help or insight that anyone could provide would be greatly appreciated.

The co-founder of Neuralink has revealed plans for an eye implant that could one day cure blindness. Called the ‘Science Eye’, it plans to tackle two distinct types of blindness for which there is no cure currently. It will work by stimulating the optic nerve with an implanted, flexible ultradense microLED display panel inserted directly over the retina. The company will then employ gene therapy to act as a go-between and link the two. Eventually, the Science Eye could work as a brain-computer interface and unlock benefits for wearers. This could include removing the need for glasses or even serving as a virtual reality device instead of a clunky headset.

Some 227 GWh of used EV batteries will become available by 2030, which would exceed the anticipated demand for lithium-ion battery energy storage systems that year. This could create a huge potential to repurpose used batteries. The battery would start its life as a car battery. Once it’s degraded it could be used as stationary energy storage. Then when it's below 70% capacity, it could be used as a backup power supply. That way a battery could be used for up to 40 years after its creation.

Each year, 29 million metric tonnes of end-of-life tires are thrown away. In the US alone,  290 million tires are taken off cars, vans, and trucks annually. Wastefront is a rubber waste recycling company that converts disused tires into useful commodities, including liquid hydrocarbons and carbon black, which can then be reutilized in processes such as alternative fuel manufacturing or ground rubber production. These hydrocarbons could then be used to create tires again or generate power. They are currently building their first 30 million dollar plant in the U.K. It will be able to process around 80,000 tonnes per year of end-of-life car and truck tire material.

Disney researchers have developed an AI tool that makes it easier to make an actor appear younger or older in a scene. The researchers created a database of random faces, re-aged them using existing machine learning aging tools, and then fed the results of that process into FRAN  (face re-aging network), which can apply effects like wrinkles or skin smoothing as a layer on top of the original face. Disney wants to develop a tool to make actors look younger, to help keep budgets in check. It has already de-aged actors in Star Wars and Indiana Jones.

CryptoCurrency,BTC to 10k Very soon: General detailed analysis and DD,"Ok so here goes.....

1) Most on chain metric bottoming indicators have not reached extremes in line with previous bear market cycle bottoms, this is a good indication there is still room to go.

2) Greyscale bitcoin trust is in trouble, would not directly post proof of reserves citing ""security conerns"", this is a big red flag, without revealing private keys reserves are not at risk and could always be moved afterwards

3) Genesis, related to the above has been trying to avoid bankruptcy, this is not likely in prevailing market conditions, interest rates to rise further, confirmed by fridays strong jobs report means that any pivot is now further off.  Markets already repriced further hikes.  Any loans genesis were hoping to secure, just had their lending criteria tightened as a result.

4) Miners are capitulating en-masse, large switch off is scheduled for this tuesday something like 10 percent or more of hashrate.  Those miners will be dumping reserves to salvage any cash they can

5) Consumer spending is already tightening, when people need cash, crypto is one of the first things that will have to go.  401k's will likely be last resort

6) Recent buying activity has not moved price much, those who bought in will sell quick once crypto turns back over, exacerbating the downmove

7) Record numbers of bitcoin buys are underwater, most are at almost 80 percent drawdown or more.  At the 9k level, bitcoin itself could come under threat, and may if lucky range under the 10k level, this sideways market could take years and will likely last until stock market has finished dipping, which will be about the time they ""offically"" start admitting theres a recession, this is how these things have played out in the past.

8) Altcoins have been pumping recently, moderate 100 percent gains for good ones mostly, this is a sign that the next wave down is to come, this usually happens before the final death throes of a bear market

9) MT Gox Hack funds starting to be distributed from January: Although these are being spread out over the year to reduce price impact, the sheer scale of the numbers 144,000 BTC, to put this into perspective its about 20% of Greyscale trusts holdings, and all of these customers lost their bitcoin back in the MTGox days so their average cost is tiny, they will all be in huge profit, the temptation to sell at the prospect of becoming an instant millionaire and be free will be huge, so a large part will get sold, this will put constant selling pressure on BTC all year.

10) The FTX fallout has still not fully hit the fan, it will, and they are already discussing regulation.  Considering the scale of funds here, and the number of people affected, you can guarantee some new regulations will be announced, the discussion meetings are already public.

With the prospect of losing 50% of my cash from here I am still waiting for the magic 10k before I even consider DCAing over the next few years, at the moment I am just adding whatever savings I can and downsizing because my expenses have all gone up significantly and I don't want to be broke when some amazing crypto prices actually come around.

I cant afford to buy in and then possibly need money for unknown expenses in the next year and take a 50% hit for the privilege, it just makes no sense.

The time is coming though and to be honest I'm quite excited at the prospect of 10k bitcoin, its a price I was dreaming of during the last bull run.  I made good money off BNB and DREP but I missed the bitcoin train.  I wont be doing that next time and thankfully theres plenty of time.

CryptoCurrency,"The myth of ""stable coin""","Stablecoins  act as a proxy for fiat currency in the crypto-economy, and ostensibly balance the amount issued with the amount of fiat on deposit.   They are also ostensibly an on-chain equivalent of fiat currency.   This is a cleverly constructed myth, and it is a mechanism by which token holders and exchanges are exposed to extreme systemic risk.   


Firstly, the myth that whoever is stabilizing the coin holds dollars equal to issued stablecoins.  Of course they don't.  In truth, they have assets putatively ""worth"" the amount of stablecoins issued, but who decides this worth?  Well, ""trust me bro, I've got it.""   That's your answer.    


When we ask for audits, we get snapshots in time.  That should set off major alarm bells.  We have no idea whether there was a clever deal with a complicit banker to momentarily swap all the toxic crap on the balance sheet for good stuff, snapshot the balance sheet for the audit while it's stuffed with good stuff, and then swap the crap back.  This is of course essentially ""renting"" real fiat for a very short period of time.  This is essentially risk-free if it's arranged well in advance, and the holder of real fiat gets a kicker for their trouble.    Furthermore, if the exchange of crap-for-fiat and then fiat-for-crap-plus-kicker is used as a mechanism to value the crap as if it is at par with fiat... then we have a real problem.  Because a different accountant can then record the pile of crap on the balance sheet, legitimately, at an established value equal to that pile of fiat.   When I say we have no idea, that's actually false.  Some of us actually have a very very good idea of what is going on, but most people don't.  Because they're very trusting.  Like lambs to the slaughter.  


The worst part is that exchanges completely control this process.  They can play a different game.  They can show that ten million crapcoins that nobody is buying but a few fools and thousands of bots trading back and forth on ledger appear to be worth a buck each - because that's what the last two bots swapped them for...  wait for a fool who thinks he's caught the next rocket to the moon to buy in with a real dollar, and then claim that the total in all their accounts adds up to ten million dollars. Presto... they just wrote ten million dollars onto their balance sheet, minus a million or so in liabilities (represented by the million crapcoins held by all the bot accounts trading 'em back and forth to make a market and a few thousand crapcoins held by suckers thinking they are trading their way to a lambo).   It's that easy.   


This might be tolerable if the exchanges and the stablecons (haha... not correcting my typo) were fully at arm's length.  But they aren't.   It's in the interest of stablecoins to be able lend and borrow, and it's in the interest of those who run exchanges to be able to convert crap into dollars so they can purchase lambos.   


This thing is an entire house of cards.  And FTX is the latest of the cards at the base to be pulled.  The usual process in the wake of something like FTX is a massive investigation, which illuminates how these schemes are played, and changes some rules.   Unfortunately, the only way out of this mess for existing stablecoin issuers is to put real fiat on their balance sheets.  What that means is getting crap off the balance sheet.  And the only way they can do that is if either (a) someone pays fiat for crap, or (b) the crap goes to zero in value.    Both of these are bad news for ""investors"" and/or anyone holding claims on the crap.  Self custody or otherwise.  


There is a third way however.  Trust nobody.   That's actually the whole point of crypto anyway, so it's not like it's an outrageous suggestion.   


Don't take your dollar and hand it to someone to keep for you, and TRUST them to continue to hold that dollar.  For certain, if the pile grows big enough they will eventually give way to the temptation to turn some of it into a piece of their lambo.    The ""trust nobody"" approach means that you take fiat, deposit it at an exchange, and turn it into an actual native crypto you can hold in self-custody.  It's that simple.  If you feel like playing arbitrage, arbitrage that crypto against other cryptos.   If you think it's going to go up up up (relative to other crypto or fiat), then hold it.  If you think it's going down (relative to other crypto or fiat) then sell.   If you absolutely feel the need to use a ""stable coin"", then buy it in the moment, use it, and sell it when the moment passes, and expose yourself to ""trust-me-bro"" risk for as short a period of time as possible.   But \*\*DO NOT hold stablecoins on deposit, even in ""self custody""\*\*.  If you do, then do so KNOWING and ACCEPTING you are holding a bag containing a partial claim on liquid dollars, supplemented with illiquid crap.    And if you do, then when the crap hits the fan (because it always does), don't be whining about the crooks who deceived you.  Because you trusted them, in the trustless economy.  Which is a fundamental breach of the whole point of crypto.

Perhaps an airplane? Something that I can rent out/make money off of to cover most, if not all, of the monthly payments. (Like what income properties do).

My long term goal is to own several large assets and to keep borrowing against them to grow my portfolio. All the while having as small of a declared salary as possible.

personalfinance,Do you have to pay estimated quarterly taxes on RSUs the first year?,"TL;DR do I have to pay estimated quarterly taxes on RSUs during the first year, before the 1-year cliff vest?

---

Hi, part of my compensation comes in the form of RSUs of my company's public stock.


I understand that, upon vest, the company will sell a portion of  the vesting stock for tax obligations (sell to cover). The amount that is sold is only 22%, though.


My effective tax rate for federal and state taxes is higher than 22% (according to [Smart Asset tax calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/income-taxes)).


I believe that I need to pay estimated quarterly taxes to the IRS, and that the amount I need to pay is the difference between my effective tax rate and the 22% that's already going to be withheld.


I was planning to ""pay"" these estimated taxes by just increasing my W-4 tax withholding or by paying online.


The RSUs have a one year cliff. I am currently in my first year at this job, so concretely the first set of shares will vest in October 2023.


My question is: do I need to pay estimated quarterly taxes throughout 2023? Do I need to pay estimated quarterly taxes this quarter (Q4 2022)? Or can I just sell an additional amount of RSUs to cover the additional tax burden and pay it at vest time next year?


I am planning to sell all of my RSUs anyway and reinvest in index funds. Ideally I'd just set aside some of that money for the tax obligation, as well as an additional portion reserved for estimated quarterly taxes in 2024.


I have searched the internet but wasn't able to find clear guidance about tax treatment during the first year of a vest with 1-year cliff. I'm planning to consult with a tax professional, but wanted to ask here to check my understanding first. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!",finance,1670098151

I'm kind of assuming that these books are well known amongst the bitcoin community - I apologize if that's not actually the case - the gist is basically fiat money = trash, bitcoin = ""hard"" money = good, although it obviously goes into a lot more depth than that. Frankly, I have felt very out of my depth reading these books and trying to think about economics this past week or so. I am able to read the arguments presented and find them compelling and see the logic in them but I am left somewhat frazzled by them, like I don't know what to make of them. Ammous does a good job of putting things simply for a bitcoin neophyte like myself but for some reason, I still struggle to fully comprehend everything. I find nothing wrong with Ammous' core arguments and honestly I'm kind of alarmed by that. Is this everyone's response to reading these books? What do mainstream economists who read them have to say about them? For me to be like, okay he's right and go about my life, I have to think pretty much everyone in government is clueless.

From Celsius to FTX to BlockFi, these massive “can’t possibly fail” projects failing is maybe in the long run good for crpyto, but in the immediate aftermath absolutely fatal. Billions of retail money wiped away, with not even a explanation for what just happened. For a lot of people, this erodes trust in the crypto space. 

2024 will still happen, therefore bitcoin halving will as well. Bitcoin will find a nice bounce, pulling some alts with it as well shortly after. But the recession, which we will still be in, will rain on Bitcoin’s parade. So we’ll see maybe $30-$40k bitcoin rally but we won’t see $100k bitcoin for a few years. Not until confidence is returned in this space. Eth will hit $3-4k again as a rally high. 

That’s 2024. In 2023, we’ll see everything continue to crash. Bitcoin is $17k now, it will hit $6k. Eth is $1.2k now, we’ll see $600 Eth soon. It doesn’t feel real now, and it won’t feel real when it happens. Why? Retail is fucked with recession and there’s no fresh money coming in, since everyone is managing just staying alive. We haven’t seen the worse of the recession yet, we’ll get there soon enough.

Edit: For those wondering how I’ve arrived at $6k low for BTC and $600 for Eth, I’m remembering what happened in the 2011 BTC crash when it went down 92%. With inflation at 40 year high, interest rate near 7%, and in the brink of recession, we’re in turbulent economic times. I don’t know we’ll reach 92% downfall from BTC $69k high but it will be close to that. Same for $4,880 ETH high since last November. 90% downfall from $69k is just short of $7k. 90% downfall from $4,880 is just short of $500. I’d imagine we’ll see those numbers again next year.",cryptocurrency,1670098720
economy,What would happen if the Federal Reserve were to stop paying interest on reserves deposited at the Fed?,"As a result of the Feds pivot from QE to fighting inflation, the Federal Reserve is now in a situation where a large portion of its income-earning assets are fixed at low interest rate while its liabilities are variable-interest obligations that are at higher interest rates.

As a result the Fed’s income has [turned negative](https://www.reuters.com/markets/us/fed-track-tens-billions-losses-amid-inflation-fight-2022-10-28/) and will continue to be negative in the near future.

Bitcoin,Having trouble setting up my nodes.,"I want to use my Trezor through my own node. I know nothing of linux but went with it anyway, installed bitcoind  and lightning node on an old laptop.

personalfinance,Transferring from brokerage to 401k,"In June, my husband and I paid cash for our house. Since the market had crashed so much, we decided to take out a $500k mortgage (interest rate around 4.5%) and invest it in the stock market, figuring our returns over time are going to be higher than 4.5%, even with taxes.

The money is sitting in the Vanguard S&amp;P 500. We put in some of the money around 3,800 and some around 3,600, which seemed a lot lower than the peak of 4,800. I know next to nothing about investing but I’m hoping I made the right call there. It is just in a typical brokerage account. 

My husband and I both have IRAs (both Roth and traditional) as well as 401ks through work (mine is a Roth 401k and he just got a new job and will shortly be able to choose which he wants). 

My plan is to basically max out our 401ks and IRAs every year since they are tax-advantaged accounts, and withdraw money from the brokerage account to cover the loss of income. I know that I will have to pay capital gains tax yearly on whatever I withdraw, and we have enough in savings accounts to cover a bad year here or there (meaning if the stock market crashes I won’t have to pull $30k while it’s down).

We don’t make enough to cover the about $30k mortgage payments as well as potentially another $50k in retirement savings without pulling money from the brokerage account. If we could, I would just do that! Likely we would need to pull about $60k yearly. 

My question - am I making the right call? Or should I just leave it all where it is and put the minimum for matching into our retirement accounts? If my plan is the correct one, how would you recommend I take withdrawals - estimate how much I need and pull monthly? Or only pull when I’m running low on cash?

SIDE QUEST:
1. Working towards completing my real estate license course (180 hours) in hopes to possibly be able to sell homes/help buyers on the side for additional income in future.
———————————————————-
2. Soon to purchase a course to become licensed to sell life/health insurance and hopefully partner with a buddy of mine who has been previously successful to learn the ropes and make more income on the side.
————————————————————
3. Invest in the following every year:
•$6500 in Roth IRA
•$5600 in 401k (including 5% match)
•$2400 in Growth Stocks
•$1200 in Crypto

• $600 to give back to community

————————————————————
6. Developing an app for a small business idea i’ve had for a while. Had a meeting with Ukraine company this morning.
————————————————————
7. Interested in creating multiple lines of clothing, which I thought a good following on a youtube channel would definitely help with.
————————————————————
8. Participate in new things to improve myself. This includes: Jiu Jitsu, Gymnastics, Reading, Chess, Gym, Juggling, Rubix Cube, Basketball, Sand Volleyball, and Golf. I like to do everything and give it a try to be the best I can be.
————————————————————
9. Becoming a prolific reader and read roughly 2-3 400+ page books a week. Currently learning to read a company’s financial statements efficiently.

END GOAL: 
In the end, I want to be financially free by the age of 35-40. I want to do whatever I want and escape the rat race (no 9-5.) I want to prove everyone I went to highschool with I was the best person they could’ve ever tried to hangout with. I know that’s not a good reason and I should be doing it for myself but it’s something that drives me everyday to show out and try to achieve success. 

ALL IN ALL: 
I am seeking any advice or opinions anyone in this sub might have. I just want to excel and make great decisions. I don’t really have friends and feel my dedicated mindset might be the issue. They always are out partying while I don’t get invited due to me often saying I can’t due to work and my separate endeavors. My plan now is to make what I am doing pay off at any means possible.

personalfinance,Broke &amp; having trouble budgeting,"Hi All,

I (28M) desperately need some advice on how to budget better. I recently (July 2022) started a new job with a good annual compensation (\~240k) in a HCOL location, but despite that I still find myself struggling to budget. I'm pretty much living hand-to-mouth at this point, and often run out of money right before my paycheck hits.

I've recently did my budget and honestly am at a loss as to where to cut.

|Item|Cost|Notes|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Salary|240k|140k Base, 100k Bonus + Stock|
|Take-home (Monthly)|6200|After Taxes &amp; 3.5k 401k Contribution|
|IRA + HSA|1500||
|Student Loan|500||
|Auto Loan|500||
|Rent|2050||
|Utilities|150||
|Gas|250||
|Auto + Home + Health Insurance|300||

|Food|200||
|Furnishing|300||
|Parent's Allowance|500||
|Other Spending|150||
|Total|\-265||

Looking at my budget I know the ""obvious"" places to cut would be Rent or my Parent's Allowance, but unfortunately I'm stuck in my lease for another 9 months, and would prefer not to cut my parent's allowance if possible given that they are retired. I could also sell my car and buy a cheaper one, but the interest rate for my auto loan is pretty good (1.9%) and I don't think I would be able to get a similar rate in today's environment. Given my tight budget I've been furnishing my place little by little, hence the furnishing budget there. I've also tried cutting my food expenditure as low as possible (cook the vast majority of my meals, eat out about twice a month in cheaper locations) but I'm still negative on my budget.

Would appreciate any advice anyone might have. Thank you!!",finance,1670158435

personalfinance,Now a good time for ARM loans?,"Heya!   
   
Seems like I may be looking to purchase a house, now that prices are settling down, and my ""starter"" home options are not so insanely priced (I've seen them bumping down 10-20% in my area, and seems I can even offer below asking still).  Based on my willing to put a 20% down payment easy, would a 5/1 ARM make sense? It seems I would be able to cut down the initial payment schedule for the first few years, and by that point reevaluate if  I need a new home due to life events or may pay down more aggressively depending on future interest rates. Are there any pitfalls I should be aware of?   
   
And before anybody asks here is a ""budget lite""   
   
Housing (Current) - ~ 1k (All utilities, renter insurance etc included)   
Vehicle (I own one car and motorcycle) - 300 ( I ""budget"" 100ish /mo for maintenance rarely gets spent, Gas and insurance here)   
Me (Food, Eat out, non discr etc.) -    ~700   
Recurring (Student Loan, Phone/Gym subs etc. most paid annual but ""spread out"" monthly for budgetary) -  ~350   
Total - ~2350   
Mo/ Post Tax Post Investment take home - 4350 (I take a 10/10 haircut for investing pre/post here and  full company match)    
   
EDIT: I make 90k annual conservatively, pre bonus, live very under my means as is and have excess monthly cashflow right now of about 2k. Something to keep in mind for if the payments shoot up 6% interest. Sounds like it might be viable right now and I just need to rate compare. maybe 7/6 or 10/6s are better from what I've gathered thus far.

stocks,Congress poised to pass marijuana banking reform in lame duck,"The Senate appears to have reached bipartisan consensus on the SAFE banking act, a bill that would open the federal banking and financial system to marijuana businesses that operate legally according to their state's law.

[The Senate plans to attach this marijuana legislation to one of the year end ""must-pass"" bills, such as the NDAA.](https://www.axios.com/2022/12/03/senate-marijuana-legislation-chuck-schumer)

Some additional notes:

1) The SAFE banking act has passed the house 6 times but has always died in the Senate. The most recent attempt last year was killed by progressives in the Senate who view the SAFE banking act as an easy win for investors/bankers while not doing much for those impacted by the war on drugs. A deal has been reached to include the HOPE act along with SAFE, which provides federal funding for states to expunge prior cannabis offenses, appeasing the demands of the progressives.

2) The NDAA is expected to be voted on this week, meaning we should see some major headlines regarding this cannabis legislation as soon as Monday.

What does this mean for cannabis stocks?

1) Aside from the news catalyst itself, the SAFE banking act should have a material impact on the financials of many of these cannabis companies. The language of the final version of SAFE is still unknown, but the core of the bill has always been to provide safe harbor for financial institutions to work with cannabis companies that are operating legally within their state. At the bare minimum, this will open the capital lending market to these companies, enabling them to get better terms on debt.

2) This will also provide safe harbor for hedge funds or other large institutions that may be interested in investing in the space but are unable to for compliance reasons. 

3) Finally, the US cannabis companies (MSOs) cannot currently trade on the major US stock exchanges like the NYSE and NASDAQ. There is some back and forth as to whether SAFE will allow these stocks to finally uplist, given that these are financial depository institutions. Many believe that yes, SAFE will allow these companies to uplist at least on the TSX (Toronoto Stock Exchange) and likely even the NASDAQ/NYSE, and there could even be special language added to the final bill to specify this.

solana,[meta] weekly pinned Solana metrics discussion thread,"My idea is to pin a thread at the top of the subreddit. The thread would have analytics relating to the health of Solana. Stuff like active users, transactions, nft volume, GitHub developer activity. 

This would be useful for Solana users to have a place to discuss and learn about the state of the chain. Right now this sort of information is available, but discussions about it are mostly on the grey web and difficult to find. Like, if you have a question about why Solana transactions are down this month you have to be in the right discord or find the right Twitter account to understand why. 

Having all that condensed into a weekly thread would be very helpful for the community. Also, it would do much to broadcast that information and those conversations to the fudsters that hang out here. For example, most of them don’t seem to even understand how Solana compares in use to other L1s. And so you have them saying Solana is dead. Which is of course ridiculous, but they’re saying that because they simply don’t have the information rubbed in their noses like they do with other L1s. I’m not saying Solana should shill like other subs do, but having easily available metrics would reduce the friction of self-education.",cryptocurrency,1670170970

Apologies for the repost - I made a mistake in the title and I couldn't edit it.

**See the real-time analysis of this portfolio at** [https://degenomic.com](https://degenomic.com/)

TL;DR

* **What is this thing?** After blowing a few accounts on terrible single-name crypto choices, this portfolio/fund was set up to see if DCA'ing emotionlessly would prove a profitable strategy over the long run.
* **How's it performing?** At the end of month 6, the portfolio has a lifetime return of -6.51%. Total inflows since inception are $1899.36 and the portfolio value stands at $1775.64, yielding a lifetime PnL of $-123.72.

# Macro Overview

It's been a tumultuous month for crypto, driven by a liquidity crisis that led to the collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto exchange FTX. Outflows from an exchange are usually considered a bullish signal as it suggests investors are HODL'ing with a long term perspective and not looking to immediately sell. In the case of FTX, investors did not trust the exchange, and the subsequent bank run ultimately led to it's demise.

The contagion has spread to other parts of the ecosystem, with lenders such as Genesis and exchanges like Gemini having to disclosure their exposure to FTX and suspend withdrawals. BlockFi have filed for bankruptcy, whilst Kraken announced they are laying off 30% of their total headcount. It would not surprise me to see other big projects fall in the coming months, as the effects of contagion are not always immediate.

The last week of November saw crypto markets find some relief as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell suggested that a tightening to 50bp hikes could arrive by ""the December meeting"". Bitcoin gained 2% week on week on the news, whilst Ethereum gained 6% - all in the hope of a smaller hike.

# Performance Detail

A terrible month for crypto in general in the wake of the FTX fallout which resulted in a -16.01% return for November (PnL -$338.53). This contrasts starkly against October's return of 15.36%. Total inflows for this month stood at $179.08.

&amp;#x200B;

The [lifetime return](https://degenomic.com/performance) of the portfolio is now back in the red, having given up all of last months performance.

&amp;#x200B;

DOGE and MATIC are single handedly holding the portfolio up; despite a November return of -13.08% for DOGE, it's lifetime return is 63.82%. Similarly, MATIC had a November return of 2.56% and a lifetime return of 27.02%.

SOL had an abysmal month, it's -54.53% return due to its close ties with FTX; SBF being one of the L1 blockchains biggest supporters. The TVL (total value locked) in the Solana network is down approximately 70% in November, largely as a result of FTX's collapse. AVAX (-30.21%) and SHIB (-23.45%) were also heavily deep in the red.

# Asset Allocation

[The portfolio](https://degenomic.com/portfolio) currently holds: BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, ADA, SOL, DOT, DOGE, SHIB, MATIC, AVAX, LINK and RUNE. DOGE's overally strong performance means it occupies 13.00% of the total value of the portfolio. This contrasts to SOL which occupies 3.41%, despite both DOGE and SOL having similar amounts of inflows.

stocks,The Buffett indicator - Everything you need to know,"The Buffett indicator is ""probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment"" - This is a quote by no other than the legendary Warren Buffett.

The goal of this post is to explain what this indicator is, how it is being calculated, the logic behind it as well as the challenges that come with it.

Let's get started!

**What is the Buffett indicator?**

In one sentence, it is a simple ratio between the market cap of the public companies within a certain country and the GDP of the same country. So, what does this ratio tell us, how should one read it?

To best understand the logic behind it, let's go to the extremes and imagine that there's a country with the following assumptions

1. All companies are public.
2. The country is isolated (does not trade with any other country)

If this is the case, the market cap would represent how much one should pay to buy ALL of the companies that are out there. These companies are also responsible for the output of the goods and services that are measured through the GDP.

Over a long period of time, this ratio would give us an idea of whether the stock market is expensive or cheap, which is the purpose of this indicator.

Of course, in reality, these assumptions aren't true.

For the US, the Buffett indicator is being measured by taking the Wilshire 5000 (a market-cap-weighted index of the market value of American stocks traded in the US) as it includes a majority of the common stocks and REITs and it is being compared against the US GDP.

Back in the 1950s, a normal ratio (where the stock market is fairly valued) was around 45%. Today, 70 years later, a normal ratio is considered around 120%. (Note, the % mentioned are only applicable to the US)

So, why is this ratio increasing over time? There are 3 arguments to touch upon:

1. There are more public companies over time - This is the weakest argument as there are also companies that are being de-listed for various reasons)
2. International sales impact market value, not GDP - This is a strong argument. Numerous companies create value outside of the US and that is captured in their market cap. However, this isn't captured in the GDP of the US.
3. Technological advances combined with increased productivity increase profits - This is also a strong argument. If a company manufactures chairs and discovers a new more efficient and effective ways to make the same chair, well, the output is the same, so there won't be any change when it comes to the GDP. However, the margins will increase, which means higher profits, and that of course leads to a higher market cap.

**Can the indicator be used for countries other than the US?**

The indicator can be calculated for almost all countries, but there are a lot of things to keep in mind.

1. It requires obtaining data for a fairly long period of time. A decade isn't enough if the stocks are expensive or cheap throughout the entire decade.
2. There's no % as a benchmark that can be used to assess whether the stock market is expensive or cheap. This is an indicator that provides insights once it is compared to itself at a different point in time.
3. Events that have significant value should be identified. These are rare, but there's an example of Aramco, one of the largest public companies, which became a public company a few years ago. Of course, this had no impact on the GDP of Saudi Arabia, but it added 7 trillion Saudi Riyal (around $2 trillion) to the market cap.
4. If public companies contribute a fairly low % of the GDP, the indicator is almost useless

**How useful is the indicator?**

In the past,  it is quite clear that the indicator can remain around 1 standard deviation (above and below) for an extended period of time. However, on only two occasions did it reach the height of 2 standard deviations in this millennium. Once, during the dot-com bubble and the second time at the last peak in 2020/2021. In both cases, there was a correction fairly soon.

This might be another tool in the arsenal for the individual investor to assess where the market is.

**The criticism**

However, in my opinion, this indicator should be used in combination with other relevant financial data. The indicator is rightfully criticized for ignoring the interest rate. Of course, this has a significant impact on the valuation of the companies. Although there were 2 occasions where the indicator showed the market was significantly overvalued, in the first case (with the dot com bubble), the 10-year Treasury rate was over 6%. In the second case, it was closer to 1%.",finance,1670179627
personalfinance,Is there a way to refinance mortgage to reduce principal?,"When mortgage rates rise, I would imagine that the *value* of the loan in the eyes of the banks would lower (similarly to how the value of bonds fluctuate).

If the value of the mortgage drops so much that it falls below the principal remaining on the loan, are there any means for a homeowner to simply pay the reduced value (what a bank would pay to acquire the loan) instead of the entire principal?

Also, is there a way to refinance to a new mortgage with a higher interest rate but a lower principal than the current loan?

Most of the advice I have read about this simply reccomends to invest money that could be paid toward the principal of a low-interest mortgage in a similarly secure investment vehicle such as a treasury bond or even a savings account or a more long-term higher rate-of-return option such as stocks and realty.

personalfinance,Advice for bad car purchase? (&lt;6 months of ownership),"Hi all,

I made a regrettable car purchase in July of this year - I bought a 2020 Mustang Ecoboost for around 27k ish (around 30k after tax). It was just a very stupid impulse decision that I didn't think about a lot before going into it. The used car market was probably at the worst it's ever been in human history and I still decided to buy a car that I didn't really like that much for some reason. I didn't realize it at the time, but it was a pretty bad overpay. 

For some background information about me and the car loan: I make 70k a year and work from home. I can pretty comfortably afford the car payments - I'm able to save over half of what I make still despite the car/insurance payments. I pay 410 a month (72 month term) at 2.9% (first time car buyer, I felt that this interest rate was pretty strong given that I had no credit history). I have about \~25k remaining on the loan. It's obviously not great - but I don't think it's that terrible either? 

The main reason that I'm regretting the car purchase is that I checked Carvana before I bought the car. Carvana was offering exactly what I paid for it at the dealership, minus the tax. So I figured that if Carvana was willing to pay that much that it couldn't be THAT bad of a deal - hence, why I pulled the trigger on the purchase in the first place. Fast forward to today, and Carvana is offering \~21k for the car, about 6k less in less than 6 months. Considering that I've barely put any miles on it, I was shocked to see how much this car depreciated in such a short period of time. I don't know if this is normal or not, but I definitely didn't see it coming. Because of this fact, I now feel like I'm just totally getting boned because I overpaid so much and I need to get out from underneath this car loan. If I were to sell the car today, I'd have to make up about a \~4k difference. I'd have to get another car as well, so it'd probably be around \~10k total when it's all said &amp; done. Would this be a bad move? I'm very unsure as to whether it would be smarter to just hold the car or to try and sell it ASAP and just take it as an expensive lesson. I just feel extremely stupid and regretful for buying the car in the first place, and I have no clue what I should do now. 

My current logic is that since I can afford it, it's probably smarter to just hold onto it for now and sell it in a few years when the depreciation slows down and the price stabilizes. But I can't help but feel terrible that this car is worth so much less in such a short period of time, I almost feel like I'd rather just cut my losses and move on from this whole situation. Part of me feels like the used car prices are about to return back to normal and I'm going to lose even more money on this car if I hold it, rather than selling it now. I'm 22 and I've never dealt with anything remotely similar to this in my entire life, so I genuinely just have no clue what to do here. I would greatly appreciate any feedback that you guys may have for me.",finance,1670206863

8. Here’s a nice video of Charles crushing the kid from The OC (who is now a middle aged crypto critic) along with some other person who says that “crypto has ruined lives.” The actor basically thinks that every cryptocurrency is just a security.

16. Apparently, Crypto.com says it accidentally sent $400 million to Gate.io and then had to ask Gate to send it back. People should be asking some serious questions about controls at crypto.com.

20. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

24. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US. The crypto space is making the same mistake in undervaluing Cardano’s long term optimization.

31. Vitalik is worried about bugs in SC code and “most worried” about hacks of ZK-Rollups. I believe it’s obvious that ETH ZK-Rollups will generally be DnPs (“deposit and pray”).

personalfinance,Help me budget for a vehicle,"Graduating from university this year and am going to be commuting around an hour total every day. I'll be making $115k salary + $35k bonus. The goal is to live off the salary and bank the bonus. I did a rough sketch of a monthly budget the other day, and it looks like my monthly post-tax income will be \~6.9k. 

I'm planning to spend $24-30k on a vehicle, and have been looking at lightly used Mazda CX-30s. While I know I can get more heavily used cars for much less...I want to minimize the pain of my commute and I plan on owning this vehicle for the next 7-10 years. 

I currently have around $35k in the bank, and given the insanity of interest rates, I'd be looking to pay down a large % of my principal in the early months of the purchase, saving around $15k in emergency funds. Regardless, my monthly car payment would probably be around $450-$550. 

My other car expenses would include parking (probably around $120 a month), and insurance. I'm currently on my parents' insurance as a rider, so it's unclear how much it would be...but I know it'll be very expensive.

Anyway, does that sound reasonable? Any advice or guidance is much appreciated!",finance,1670225662

personalfinance,Should I repay a housing loan early?,"I have taken out a housing loan about a year ago in the amount of EUR 100,000 with 2.12% interest rate over 20 years, so the final payment will be EUR 125,000. I have recently came into some money (around EUR 85,000) which would allow me to repay the loan within the first year. 

My question is should I repay the loan or do something else with the money? I have no idea where to invest it and this is not enough money to buy a second property that would generate enough revenue for loan instalments.

economy,"What role does goes government play in helping the poor, and controlling inflation?","The central banks, in most of the biggest economies, have inflation targets, which they try to meet, with monetary policy. But if government is spending more, by giving money to people, or subsidizing, food or energy bills, isn't this creating inflation, especially if there is an increasing fiscal deficit? 

Clearly, the government should ensure, that people have enough to eat, and energy for their homes. I support targeted cash transfers to the poorest people, which they have the responsibility of choosing how to spend. 

In India, which is a poor country, there are several schemes to help poor people, which I support. Rural employment schemes. Subsidized or free, food and energy. But I just wonder, if a targeted cash transfer scheme would work better. A UBI which covers everyone would be more expensive, but still feasible as most people are poor. 

In developed economies, where there is better data, less poor, and more people file income taxes, a negative income tax can provide more varying and specific cash transfers to poor people. 

What risks do cash transfers carry for inflation? If government raises taxes, to pay for cash transfers, are the risk mitigated? Is there any difference in inflation impact between subsidized food or energy, and cash transfers?",finance,1670244834

# [Stock futures slip slightly to start the week as traders look ahead to more economic data](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/04/stock-futures-are-little-changed-as-investors-enter-a-quiet-period-ahead-of-the-feds-december-policy-meeting.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures fell Monday as investors awaited more economic data ahead of the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting later this month.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell by 150 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.5% and 0.4%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off its second positive week in a row, with the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq advancing 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively. The Dow advanced 0.2% last week.
*****
&gt; In other news, Tesla shares slumped more than 4% on reports of an output cut at its Shanghai factory.
*****
&gt; Those moves came after Fed Chair Jerome Powell signaled that smaller interest rate hikes could start in December. The Fed is slated to meet Dec. 13-14 and is expected to raise rates by 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage points. On Friday, stronger-than-expected jobs report initially rattled markets, but traders later shook it off.
*****
&gt; Despite the recent rally, Morgan Stanley strategist Mike Wilson said the risk-reward for equities has likely reached its cap as it nears the bank’s original tactical target range of 4,000 to 4,150.
*****
&gt; “As suggested two weeks ago, for this tactical rally to go higher, back end rates would need to fall,” he said in a note to clients Monday. “Fast forward to today and that’s what has happened. However, we are now right into our original upside targets and we recommend taking profits before the Bear returns in earnest.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, investors are expecting the November ISM services data at 10 a.m. ET on Monday. Economists polled by the Dow Jones expected a reading of 53.7.

personalfinance,"Moving for work, keep my low interest mortgage or sell the property?","Hello everyone,
I have been offered a large raise to relocate for work and accepted it. I was fortunate enough to buy my first house in December 2020 but will need to move in the next 6 months. I have a 2.5% mortgage with about $350,000 left on a house that would likely sell for $650,000. Current payments are $2,000 and similar houses in my area rent for $3,000 - $3,500. I also have about $150,000 in federal student loans from grad school (around 6%).

I hate giving up a 2.5% mortgage but selling the house would allow me to pay off the student loans and save about $2,000/mo in student loan payments.

Do I sell the house and pay off the student loans, Keep the house and try to rent it, or is there some third option that I should consider?

personalfinance,Election period for Federal LTC Insurance is closing and I'm not sure if it's worth it,"Heya!

Me/my wife are both eligible for policies if we want. We are late 20s and healthy.

Offer:

45/paycheck (26 periods/year) for 850k cap, 450/day no inflation adjustment coverage policy. Important detail that is my main concern is that even though this is a Federally backed product, the Board can meet and decide to raise premiums. I'd hate to be 40 years into paying, see no benefit, just to have my rate increased to 1k/mo and drop it. Simply contributing to HSA would be more beneficial than nothing.

There is an open enrollment that closes on December 12th which my wife is also eligible for - then they are closing the enrollment for at least two years as they ""evaluate the premiums offered""

Anyone have advice/opinion on this?

Assuming my premium doesn't change since I'm enrolling so young, that would be around 35k invested at 58 years old (30 years from now) with a potential payout over 800k + peace of mind... Seems tempting.",finance,1670249771
CryptoCurrency,"Looking at both sides: The good news and the bad news about key macroeconomics, and their impact on the crypto market.","**Note:** this will have a lot of US-centric data. It's not because I think the US is the center of the world, but the crypto market has reacted more heavily on US data.

# Why do outside markets matter for crypto?

While it's true that lately correlation between crypto and traditional markets hasn't been as consistent as it was earlier this year, the macro picture could still affect the crypto market.

While crypto has a lot of its internal forces (like the halvings) which long term outweighs outside influence, short term the outside influence could have a bigger impact.

# Good News:

**-US GDP is back up.**

It's currently up by more than 4%. Inflation adjusted, the real GDP is up 2.9%.

This one has many people in disbelief, as we are supposed to be in recession, and officially were since we had two consecutive negative GDP quarters earlier this year.

&amp;#x200B;

**-CPI is cooling off.**

It has cooled off from 9.1% at its peak this year, down to now 7.7%.

But that still means inflation is going up, so why is it good news? It means inflation is cooling back, and showing that whatever was fueling it, is beginning to reverse.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Oil prices are dropping.**

Oil went from over $120 this year, down to under $80.

We are also about to enter the seasonally low demand months this year. So it could fall further. On top of that, while on paper OPEC said it would make more cuts, in reality they are still behind their quota, meaning they still need to raise outputs. Plus, demand is once again taking a big hit in China.

# Bad news:

**-Inverted yield curve.**

Normally, the longer you lend money, the higher the yield. CDs, bonds, etc, are supposed to give you better returns the longer you're willing to wait to maturity.

This has gone ass backwards, the longer you lend, the lower the yield.

Which can only mean one thing, the market is expecting long term pain and recession.

However, this is based on market reaction and people's expectations. It has often been a good indicator, but is not always a guarantee.

And things get a little more complicated, as Feds could change the rate hikes and terminal range expectations, etc...

&amp;#x200B;

[Yield curve inversion](https://preview.redd.it/znufjirqj34a1.jpg?width=846&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=daa30a2a3fc7723699302de7bf966c0f96fa7272)

&amp;#x200B;

**-Potential real estate correction or even crash.**

The housing market got its prices artificially pushed due to covid and supply chain restrictions. Making real estate prices go sky high in a short time.

With the supply chain recovering, construction picking up again, supply in the market increasing, while demand isn't keeping up due to mortgage rates, it's expected that we will see a correction here, and possibly a big one.

&amp;#x200B;

**-Unemployment in the US is remaining low.**

Despite some recent layoffs in the news, November actually still ended up with 260,000 more jobs, and with wages up 0.6%.

Why is that bad news? It's probably good news short term for the average person. But the Fed is trying to push more unemployment to tackle inflation. If they can't tackle inflation, it means more rate increases, which will be bad news for stocks, crypto, and most markets. Which also means no soft landing.

&amp;#x200B;

**-China crisis.**

Can't spell FUD without China.

There's a lot of different crises going on around the world. And there's definitely concerns across Europe. And never any shortage of concerns in the middle east.

But China is taking the cake right now.

China went from a real estate collapse, to a banking crisis, to a complete economic crisis, to now a social crisis.

Things are falling apart, and it will affect the rest of the world.

Granted, the last big economic crisis in China only briefly caused a small correction to markets around the world. Due to its isolation in a lot of its economic aspects, and increased disconnection. But this one is on a bigger level.

&amp;#x200B;

There's obviously more good news and bad news, but I picked what I thought would be key for crypto right now, and was clear and not muddled.

# Conclusion:

There's no point in pledging absolute allegiance to team bull or team bear, or get married to one narrative. Things are more complex than that.

The only sure thing, is there's a recipe for volatility.

I've only highlighted a very small sample, of just the one I personally believe are important drivers outside of crypto right now, which could enter into the crypto market.

&amp;#x200B;

What do I personally see in my crystal ball?

This is just my personal opinion.

It's possible that stocks continue to rally, but that's too optimistic in my opinion, and I more likely see a new low coming up. But this doesn't necessarily mean crypto will find a new low.

Crypto is more volatile, and moves faster than the stock market. So it's not inconceivable that it could end its bear market before stocks.

If Bitcoin does still drop, because of more bad events, I can't see it doing more than $12.7K.

The sellers and selling pressure has been overextended already and squeezed out to its last drop.

You can see evidence of that with the latest bad news in recent months not having as big of an effect as earlier this year, or as big as expected. Even when stocks dropped hard in more recent months, Bitcoin hasn't responded as much as it did earlier this year.

Recent Fed rate hikes, China FUD, SEC FUD, MT Gox Fud, barely moved Bitcoin.

At the same time, crypto has increasingly shown inconsistencies with its correlation to stocks, and even macros.

The correlation has been decreasing for the last few months:

&amp;#x200B;

[Decreasing correlation with the S&amp;P500](https://preview.redd.it/ltxcj89sm34a1.jpg?width=1793&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=129d4ee8b8d3e5ad94db07373245272c46f3a717)

So much of the selling pressure has already been squeezed out. Most of the people who would panic out, have already panicked out. And in terms of percent drops, we are right where we would expect to be right now....even with a black swan event.

The question is if enough of the selling pressure has been squeezed out to avoid a new low. Making prices too good for the market not to start accumulating. If enough of the bear market has already run its course for crypto. If we've already pretty much decoupled from stocks.",cryptocurrency,1670255281

personalfinance,HELOC vs cash out refinance?,"My husband and I purchased a house in 2021 for $235k, putting down about $180k from a previous house sale. A year into living here, we want to do a kitchen renovation. Our first thought was to find a HELOC.

Our mortgage broker doesn’t offer them and encouraged us to avoid a cash out refinance and definitely do a HELOC because we are currently at a 3.25% fixed interest rate. However, our mortgage company doesn’t handle HELOC.

We inquired with our bank (Schwab) and are getting encouragement in the opposite direction: to do a cash out refinance and a new mortgage at a fixed rate of 6.375%. The argument made was that HELOC is ARM and we can always refinance the new fixed rate once rates go down. The new quoted monthly is about $500 more than we’re paying now, whether we do HELOC or refinance with Schwab.

It’s a weird situation because we only owe around $50k on the mortgage and are seeking about the same amount to do the renovation. I’m trying to parse if there’s an obvious best way to go about it - every individual I speak to who has a stake in our business is encouraging us strongly in directions that seem to benefit them, and I was hoping this sub might help offer an unbiased perspective on the situation.",finance,1670259281

Just started considering a Roth IRA,"Hello, I recently discovered the Prime Directive and found it a good guide to follow since I still have a lot to learn about finance. I recently started with a company with a probably good enough 401k plan and began getting as close to maxing it out as I could  based on family advice and general impressions from the internet and here. 

My wife has started school as well and is now going to be taking on student loans for grad school (we might be able to pay for her schooling but to start out we decided to take out a loan) at a nearly 6% interest rate after she graduates. We are budgeting to pay it off aggressively as if we paid in full each semester. Should we try to get her through without taking on more debt? Or is it fine to take on the debt? Somewhere in the middle? 

After I found the Prime Directive, I'm considering if I should adjust my contributions to get my employer match (%5 to get full match) and try to build my emergency fund after being wiped to 0 (it was small to begin with only ~$1200) and open an IRA and try to max it out at the same time. Should I do this? After running the numbers and setting up projections and a more proper budget to build the e-fund it's painful to see how long it could take. Especially considering the markets right now and how I think I agree that its an opportune time to invest at a discount.

My finances in a nutshell:

* Salary before tax and contribs and health: $\~90k
* Current take home close to maxing 401k: $4400
* Take-home after adjusting to 5% contribution: $5600
* Living expenses (monthly): $2,800 (\~$1600 rent M-HCOL city)
* 401k worth: \~$15k
* E-fund: $0
* CC: paying off in full each month
* Debt:
   * $1120 on track to pay off without interest by April (promotional no interest purchase)
      * $200/month
   * $200 on track to pay off with no interest by March
      * $54/month
* Wife's first semester student loan: \~$4000 
   * Lump sum on track to pay off in full by Jan 
* No other investment accounts

**Me (27yo)**

* I make about $6,000/mo pre tax, no kids other than a partner. MCOL.
* Monthly Expenses: $2,000ish (it includes all my fixed expenses... car loan, rent, food, gas, insurance, utilities etc.)
* Debt: Car loan with $24,000 left at 2.49% on a 60-month term (The initial principal was $30k after putting a decent chunk down. The car is worth about $52k (far from being upside down on it).
* Savings: About $1,200-$1,400/mo.
* Retirement: $550/mo to 401K, $500/mo to Roth IRA, and $240/mo from my employer that goes towards my 401k
   * I have contributed about 24% of my total salary this year and I hope to increase that a bit more next year.
   * 90% of my Roth contributions go towards FSKAX and the other 10% towards FTHIX.
   * 401k goes towards a Target Retirement Fund
* Current Savings: I have about $16k in a HYSA account paying 3% and $40k between my Roth and 401k.

**Here are the changes I plan to make in 2023 -- salary to remain the same**

* Save about $1,200-$1,400/mo (same as in 2022)
* Start my first HSA to which I will contribute $320/mo straight from my paycheck to max it out
* Increase my Roth IRA contribution from $500/mo to $541/mo to max it out
   * Invest in 90% FSKAX and 10% FTHIX
* Lower my 401k contribution to $500/mo (more than enough to still get my company's match)
   * It all goes to the Target Retirement Fund.
   * Existing 401k plan has a high ER (1.5%)

Additionally, I plan on paying off the car loan quicker (not a priority due to the low interest rate) and add more towards a house down payment fund when unexpected funds come in (I'm already 7 months ahead on the car loan). 

I will be saving about $1,600/mo towards retirement (goal is to have $60k by the end of 2023) and $1,200 in cash.

investing,The Fed is hiking as earnings are falling and people have redefined the word 'pivot' into something nonsensical,"So to start things off here is how the Fed would usually react to weakening economic conditions: 

1.  Economic activity is weakening -&gt; the Fed will ease financial conditions in order to minimize the economic pain

2. The impact of rate cuts are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

3. There is some suffering, but thanks to the Fed, the expected pain was lessened and we are able to return to growth

Now thanks to inflation, here is how things are going:

1. Economic activity is weakening -&gt; the Fed is actively tightening financial conditions in order to cause economic pain in order to manage inflation

2. The impact of rate hikes are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

3. There is considerable suffering as the Fed requires economic activity to contract in order to manage inflation

4. Once inflation is sufficiently tamed, the Fed will cut rates so the economy can return to growth

5. The impact of rate cuts are not immediate, it will take 12-18 months for the full effects to kick in

People are assuming that inflation is going to rapidly fall off when we don't even have positive real rates across the entire US yield curve. 

While goods inflation is rapidly abating, the recent nonfarm payrolls and ISM services heavily implies we are seeing the beginning stages of a wage-cost spiral. CPI will fall as goods disinflate, but services will support inflation.

People believe the Fed hiking 50 bps is 'pivoting' and have twisted rate hikes into something that is positive for the markets. 'pivot' is now akin to 'transitory' and the word is now bastardized to death.  

The current economic outlook is bad. Its really bad. Analyst predictions have historically been more optimistic vs reality and this time around they all forecast a downturn. Its more likely than not their current forecasts are too optimistic and that 2023 will end up worse than many expect.

# Asset Allocation Rationale

**Factor Tilts &amp; Geographic Diversification:**

I have moved my portfolio away from all S&amp;P 500, and instead have bought indices that also capture small, medium, and large-cap equity exposure across US and ex-US developed and developing markets. I have also incorporated factor tilts (value, momentum) in hopes of generating premia. While I hope to capture the historical premia these factors have provided, minimizing risk is my main priority. While the S&amp;P 500 has been a great historical investment, I prefer to diversify across companies of different sizes as well as minimize my geopolitical risk. It's not obvious that growth and US equity will continue to outperform (particularly growth). Also, the historical and potential asset covariance is a plus.

**Leveraged Indices:**

In August of last year, I chose to participate in [Hedgefundie's Excellent Adventure](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=272007) with about 25% of my NW. Needless to say, with equity drawdowns and especially interest rate hikes, I regret this decision. However, I always viewed HFEA as a lottery ticket, and am not too torn up about this current loss.

**Margin Debt:**

I borrow against my current stock (\~1.4x levered) The downsides are margin call risk and the cost of financing debt (currently 5.75%; I'm willing to hold this margin debt with the expectation that equities will outperform). I carefully evaluate historical drawdowns and only hold margin debt amounts that I am comfortable with (more margin means less portfolio drawdown to receive a margin call).

**Futures:**

Currently, I hold one S&amp;P e-mini contract at 2x leverage. I prefer futures over LEAPS options given the lower cost of financing, and the linear returns with the underlying asset (no extrinsic value component). I'll likely get involved in treasury futures for the sake of diversification and generating higher returns.

# Closing

Ultimately, much of my investing involves leverage. I don't believe this is necessarily foolish. Just as 100% stocks while young isn't inappropriate for most, I don't think 110% or even 150% stock exposure is unreasonable for those with the risk tolerance. If you're interested in looking into the subject more, I recommend giving the book [Lifecycle Investing](https://www.lifecycleinvesting.net/) a read.

personalfinance,Advice on handling loan balance after totaled vehicle without gap insurance,"My wife and I had a vehicle for a year and 3 months that was financed and we owed a little less than it was worth(we owed around $20k it was worth about $24k), but then we experienced massive mechanical failures.  Instead of paying for repairs ($6000+) we decided to take a hit on the value and trade for another vehicle and rolled over about $7000 in negative equity.   The next vehicle had a warranty and we felt the peace of mind was worth the cost, plus it got us bs join something quickly (we have 2 kids to transport).  

In hindsight this was a very poor decision, but it gets worse.  The finance company refuses gap insurance due to the amount of negative equity, but my wife and I had been discussing either a home equity line of credit or Cash-out refinance due to us having a good bit of equity in our home. (We have several home repair/remodel things we would like to do). So I thought, that’s fine don’t give us gap, we will use some of that money to refinance the car and get gap insurance.

That was early August, laziness and indecisiveness puts us at November 11 with no refinance and no gap.  A tree limb falls on the vehicle and totals it.

We are going to owe just over $8k to the bank after insurance pays them the ACV.

Is the bank going to demand the sum immediately?  Will they want me to keep making our current payment?  Will the offer any kind of payment plan or other options?

Is a HELOC still a decent option?  I know that doesn’t eliminate the debt, but it goes in with the home repair/remodel debt and spreads out the term and lower interest rate?

Any other advice is welcome, I know several poor decisions have lead me here, I’m hoping to avoid more.

TL;DR - we owe the bank $8k+ after not having gap insurance on a totaled vehicle, is a HELOC a good option to move the debt over, or other options?",finance,1670293097

stocks,Three reasons why I believe lows are not yet in,"I've been in cash since late 2021.  For some specific holdings, I was in cash a little longer.  I've ignored the urge to buy over the last several months despite a couple compelling rallies.  I believe we're headed lower in early 2023, and here's why.

1. Shiller PE has exceeded 30 three times in history (four if you count 2018 as a separate occurence): 1929, dot-com, 2018 and 2020-2021.  In every instance, a correction followed.  **We are still at 29.26.**  That is very expensive.  I'm not going to get into the details of why I think criticisms of Shiller PE are mostly misguided, but I think any criticism that could be levied is probably outweighed right now by the fact that we have the highest Fed Funds Rate of the last twenty years, and that should significantly impact the price we're willing to pay for earnings.
2. The terminal rate is now likely going to be higher than previously thought, yet the market hasn't adjusted.  In the September dot plot (page 4: [https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcprojtabl20220921.pdf)), not a single FOMC member projected a terminal rate over 5%.  Last week, Powell himself said the terminal rate will be higher than projected by that dot plot, and we can probably back into that conclusion just by starting with the current rate target (3.75-4%) and adding in a couple very likely looming 50bps hikes.  Just those two hikes get us to 5%.  Does anyone honestly believe the Fed will be done at that point?  I can't imagine so.  While the path down to 5-6% on CPI might be somewhat easy, it's highly unlikely it won't take more to get to 2-3%.  I don't think stock prices are properly accounting for this material change in expectations and its corresponding real economy threat.
3. **Markets don't bottom before recessions begin.**  This hasn't happened a single time in the last 80 years (see for yourself: [https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data](https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data)).  While markets might bottom before a recession is declared, the beginning date of that recession (declared after the fact) has pretty much always been before the bottom of the market.  Does anyone think a recession will be declared to have begun in Q4 2022?  I can't imagine so with unemployment this low.  This is a point I see people get wrong all the time on this sub.  While it's true that stocks often head higher before recessions are over, they don't do so before recessions begin.

Those are my reasons.  Now feel free to throw all of your ""DCA is the way"" and ""If you wait for the robins, Spring will be over"" shoes at me.",finance,1670302556

CryptoCurrency,"Since it is quite obvious by now that the cryptocurrency market, just like its sister the stock market thrive in no to low interest rate environments, it is my belief that the bear market we are currently in could last a whole lot longer... here's why:","Until I jumped into my time machine this morning, I thought like many of you that what Jerome Powell was currently doing, which is ""slowly"" raising interest rates over the course of 2022 and maybe on into 2023 as well, that a soon to be 5% interest rate or possibly more will be a decent dose of medicine in order to flush out the bad actors, who have put their essentially free money to work over the last 2 years.

Already we have seen the interest rate hikes take out many of the bad actors already this year, including, but not limited to: FTX, Terraform Labs, Celsius Network, Voyager Digital and Three Arrows Capital, and BlockFi, which are just the cryptocurrency companies, now we are even seeing mainstream companies showing major signs of weakness over higher interest rates, such as Blackstone, BlackRock, and a myriad of other housing related companies such as Zillow.

I think the fall of FTX may have been the catalyst for what is about to happen to all of the remaining cryptocurrency companies, because the full extent to the contagion has not even begun to spread, because the smartest people in the room are keeping their mouths shut until all of their money is safe, but I can assure you, all of these cryptocurrency companies remaining will no longer be able to secure loans in order to keep operating, because the cryptocurrency market is so toxic right now, and even if they did secure a few loans, the interest on them would most likely outpace their measly trading fees that they are currently getting in this extremely long crypto winter.

Also too, the accounting tricks a lot of these cryptocurrency exchanges have been using in this bear market with their own printed out of thin air tokens are about to lose all their steam. FTX tried to the very end to use their FTT token in order to stay afloat, until his arch nemesis Changpeng Zhao got him by the balls, and dumped his shitcoin on the market, essentially landing the death punch to the balls of Samuel Bankman-Fried, and his fugazzi of an exchange FTX.

Now we have to take into account that the United States and the powers that be have not even admitted that things are very very bad at the moment, and are pretending that we are not headed for a major recession, so take that into consideration when you think about these last remaining cryptocurrency companies. Cryptocurrency is discretionary, and when people need to eat and pay their rent, imaginary money is the last thing on their minds, especially when all it does is go down in an extended bear market.

I don't want to be all doom and gloom, so I will say this... fortunes have been made in very tough times, so if you have money to spare, throw it at your favorite coins, tokens, and stocks during these dark times, because dollar cost averaging as prices erode in my opinion is one of the greatest financial tactics.

Lastly, I will get back to my time machine, and leave you with a little fact, that will help you see that we are probably not getting out of this with the slow increase in interest rates the Fed thinks is going to lead us into a so called ""soft landing"". 

At the end of the 1970's and on into the 1980's, the then Fed Chair Paul Volcker did this: He slammed the brakes on the economy by raising interest rates to 20% — tough medicine to prove he was serious about getting inflation under control.

Now you tell me... you really think Jerome has the balls or the backing to do something that bad ass?

defi,What is zkLend?,"In this podcast, host [Henri Lieutaud](https://twitter.com/henrlihenrli) speaks with [Jane](https://twitter.com/jane0mac) and [Brian](https://twitter.com/bfu_fubrian), Co-Founder of [zkLend](https://twitter.com/zkLend), on what gets them excited about technology in general, blockchain in particular, and validity rollups.

&amp;#x200B;

Read our notes below to learn more

&amp;#x200B;

**What is zkLend**

* A money market protocol also known as a lending protocol on StarkNet.
* Building Artemis which is a permissionless product that lets any users with wallets interact with the protocol, borrow and lend.
* Building Apollo which targets institutions to get whitelisted in order to access the protocol, borrow and lend.
* Currently have 11-12 team members.

&amp;#x200B;

**Brian’s background**

* Studied Engineering Physics back in Canada.
* Worked in traditional finance for the past 13-14 years.
* First heard about crypto back in 2015.
* Started to look into DeFi in 2020 and got interested because of [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap).
* Studied different protocols like [Aave](https://twitter.com/AaveAave), [Compound](https://twitter.com/compoundfinance) and others.

&amp;#x200B;

**Jane’s background**

* Studied both Economics and History in the U.S.
* Studied the history of stocks, finance, Tulip Mania etc.
* Worked in New York for 2 years in sales and trading.
* Worked in HongKong for 2 years in the private banking industry.
* Worked for a startup called Deliveroo, a food delivery business in HongKong.
* First heard about Bitcoin in 2014.

&amp;#x200B;

**Origin of the idea**

* Tracked the development of the whole space.
* The team decided and had the conviction to build a lending protocol because this is something that will help a lot of total cost scale and onboard a lot of users onto the ecosystem.
* Lending protocols, in terms of evolution, have a long way to go.
* Lending protocol sector is still at a very early stage.
* Lending in a way is quite constrained to the protocol itself like the interest rates are determined based on utilization of the pool within a protocol.
* TradFi interest rates are not based on how much demand is within that bank but by how much demand is within the entire market.

&amp;#x200B;

**Things missing in DeFi**

* The interest rate market is completely missing in the blockchain.
* There is a fundamental fragmentation in current lending protocols.
* There’s a need for derivative interest rate products like interest rate swaps.
* Decentralization of loans is needed to have transparency and benefit more individuals.

   
 

**Thoughts on landscape of crypto**

* Have been lucky and unlucky to experience quite a bit of the cycle within the 9 months.
* A lot of protocols and a lot of builders are focused on discoverability of it whether it's sustainable or if there are any innovations on what they’re creating.
* The quality of the community has really gone up in terms of people really seeking to learn and utilize some of the protocols rather than pure shill.
* The StarkNet ecosystem has gotten a lot more inclusive than at the beginning and has been seeing a lot more diversity.

&amp;#x200B;

**Asia Web3 scene**

* It’s quite reflective of the character of each city.
* HongKong is quite concentrated in VCs and investors but less focused when it comes to projects and developers.
* Seeing a lot of developers in Taiwan.
* Singapore and Hongkong are both fighting for a lot of resources and hiring talents in Web2 and Web3 space.
* A lot of existing talents are diverted into the Web2 fintech based and there are a lot of innovations.
* There’s tons of talent that's going to come from Asia as a whole.

&amp;#x200B;

**Future of zkLend**

* For Apollo, the team started looking at borrowing and what institutions want.
* Very interested in interest rates and how they converge or diverge from traditional markets.
* In the next couple of years, we will start to see more institutions coming in not just in terms of money, but in terms of other forms of assets being able to convert into the crypto space.
* The real world and DeFi are starting to merge.
* Testnet has been live since a month ago.

CryptoCurrency,The bottom theory,"I've seen a lot of people asking whether we reached the bottom or expecting the fed to pivot so they can enter.

**This is not what you need, you need is decent pricing on the assets you wished to own.**

Taking you back to 2019

&amp;#x200B;

If you bought BTC at 6400$ you would then lose  half of it in the next couple of months and would not see you back in green for about \~7 months 

But then you would still be in green with BTC at 17k right now.

**It's a hard punch on your finances yes but imagine with your mindset of catching the bottom:**

You would be able to get it at 4k \~3,7k and then it still dropped to 3.2k, with that mindset you would be selling at a lost, **you thought you didn't catch the real bottom**, and would only comeback when we were already back in 6k, 10k or worse 20k.

I've done this I know what it's like to time the market and fail miserably.

With the mindset of catching the bottom you will always doubt whether this is the real bottom whether it can still go lower and whether this is really a bull market.

**All this thinking will eventualy prevent you from buying an asset that's probably at a very good price of entry.**

&amp;#x200B;

To solve the first scenario of buying BTC at 6k a good solution would be to DCAing the next months.",cryptocurrency,1670333315

Pretty much, I want a game that’s like 1-4 player co-op. Maybe you have hunger and thirst meters (I don’t really care) but more importantly you and your friends are scavengers for AI run towns. There could be multiple bases/towns across the apocalyptic wasteland. And maybe you have to do specific missions for them to gain access to their town, and their town might have benefits (specific weapons, merchants, etc), but once you gain access you are in charge of keeping the town fed, with clean water, and medical supplies. So you and your buddies have to go out scavenging for supplies to keep their meters up. If one meter gets too low, the town dies and you lose the benefits. 

You could have multiple ways to scavenge. You could use the cover of darkness, suppressors, and go by foot, which could be safer but if things went bad you’d have no quick escape. Or you could do a drive by kind of method. Get a vehicle. Drive up fast. Smash and grab, and get out. You’d attract more attention but your getaway is right there. 

Let’s say you focus on one base though. Maybe you keep bringing all your supplies there. Well that base will start growing and expanding but as other areas fall, you start getting risk of raiders attacking and stealing supplies. 

As for a goal of the game, there could be some sort of story, but honestly I’m just a big fan of games that never really end.",technology,1670334792

# [Stock futures are little changed after Monday’s rout](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/05/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Tuesday, as traders took a breather after fears of even higher rates sparked a sell-off during the previous session.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded 20 points higher, or 0.06%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures rose marginally higher.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite led Monday’s downward charge, dropping 1.93% for its biggest one-day drop since Nov. 9. The S&amp;P 500 shed 1.79%, also notching its worst day in nearly a month. The Dow, meanwhile, lost 482 points, or 1.4%.
*****
&gt; Better-than-expected November ISM Services data, which looks at the purchasing level of manufacturers as a gauge the health of the broader economy, pressured equities Monday. The report stoked fears that the Federal Reserve will need to hike rates for longer than anticipated to bring down inflation. The release aligns with the payrolls report late last week in pointing to resilience within some areas of the economy.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is largely expecting a 50 basis point increase to interest rates at the Fed’s December meeting, but remain conflicted over how long the central bank’s interest rate hiking campaign will need to last, especially given the latest data.
*****
&gt; Despite this backdrop, markets could still move higher in the months ahead, even though slowing growth and higher rates will persist even into the new year, wrote Jason Draho, UBS’ head of asset allocation, in a note to clients.
*****
&gt; “A year-end rally may still be in the offing, though investors are likely to remain skittish until November CPI is released on the 13th and the FOMC meeting concludes on the 14th,” he said. “If there are no surprises with these events, momentum could continue.”
*****
&gt; Investors will look ahead to data Tuesday morning on international trade for insight into the strength of the U.S. and global economy. Later in the day, they will watch for post-bell earnings reports from Smith &amp; Wesson and Stitch Fix.

stocks,What is an 'inverted yield curve' and why does it matter?,"source: [https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-and-why-does-it-matter-1.1855134](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/what-is-an-inverted-yield-curve-and-why-does-it-matter-1.1855134)

Short-term bonds are currently showing higher yields than long-term bonds in a reversal of the typical pattern. As of Monday, the yield for two-year short-term bonds were pegged at 3.8 per cent, while 10-year bonds yielded 2.8 per cent.

What does the trend mean, and why does it matter?

**WHAT IS IT**

“Inverted yield curves are very bad news,” said Duke University Finance Professor Campbell Harvey, who is credited with discovering the relationship between inverted yield curves and economic growth. The model has reliably preceded recessions in the U.S. and Canada over the last few decades.

A positive yield curve slope is good for economic growth, while “flat or negative is bad,” Harvey said in a phone interview. That reading has allowed the model to act as a reliable early warning signal for a recession.

Harvey explained that long-term bonds usually have higher interest rates than short-term ones, with a “premium for taking on longer-term investments” which are generally considered riskier.

But sometimes the pattern reverses, due to factors like people dropping riskier assets like stocks and investing in government treasuries which are considered safer, he said.

Another possible factor is rising inflation, which leads central banks to drive up the short-term interest rates in response. Central banks in both Canada and the U.S. are taking that tactic at the moment, and Harvey noted that the policy direction has led to economic slowdowns and recessions in the past.

University of Toronto economics professor Angelo Melino said the yield curve reflects what markets think will happen, and at the moment it shows an anticipation of falling interest rates.

“It's telling you that people think either we're going to get less inflation in the future or we'll get lower real interest rates in the future because of a recession, or both,” he said in a phone interview.

**POSSIBILITY FOR A SOFT LANDING**

Research published in October by the Conference Board of Canada pointed to [**September and August yield curve data in Canada**](https://www.conferenceboard.ca/insights/featured/canadian-economics/probability-of-a-recession-next-year) as a sign of declining investor sentiment and negative market outlook – but noted that the pattern “does not necessarily indicate that a recession is on the cards.”

“What the inversion of the yield curve tells us is that investor sentiment has dampened, and the risk of recession has intensified,” Conference Board economist David Ristovski wrote.

In a phone interview on Monday, Ristovski noted that the yield curve inversion has grown since he published the analysis. His organization has pegged the risk of a recession occurring in the next 12 months as relatively high, but isn’t forecasting an outright recession. 

“We are calling for more stagnant growth rather than an outright technical recession,” he said.

Harvey said he sees room for an engineered “soft landing” given the current picture of the labour market with excess demand for labour helping some sectors bounce back quickly from layoffs. He also pointed to short-term inflation, which is currently sitting higher than what people expect in the long-term, as another “wild card” in the direction of economic growth.

“It is possible that we could dodge a recession in a technical sense and still have slow growth,” he said.

Melino said the inverted yield curve is a signal “like the canary in the coal mine” that hints at economic downturn to come, but it must be considered with other factors.

**WHAT SHOULD THE CENTRAL BANK DO**

The Bank of Canada is set to raise interest rates again on Wednesday in its final policy decision of the year.

Overnight interest rates currently sit at 3.75 per cent after several successive increases and economists are debating the size of what Wednesday’s rate move will be, with many predicting an increase of 25 basis points.

Harvey said he would advise central banks in Canada and the U.S. to introduce lower-than-expected rate increases to avoid overshooting their objective of lowering inflation. Continuing with rate hikes for longer than necessary could “(cascade) into a recession, and potentially the dreaded hard landing recession, which nobody wants,” he said.

“For me, they should exercise caution,” he said. “I'd probably pause the increases.”

Ristovski said he expects the Canadian central bank will raise its central interest rate one more time but with a smaller increase than its most recent hikes.

He acknowledged the risks of raising central interest rates too aggressively and too quickly, but said he expects the Bank of Canada will bring down inflation without doing too much harm to the economy.

“We believe that the Bank of Canada will succeed in lowering inflation and we believe that Canada will not enter a technical recession,” he said.",finance,1670336738
stocks,Why this is a weird time and the market is erratic and volatile,"In a nutshell, I've come up with the following assessment based on my research that isn't calling a bottom or anything but is driving my investment strategy.  


Since 2009, the market has been driven more by the Federal Reserve Fund Rate (FFR) that enabled a lot of companies to grow, particularly in the tech industries, due to easy debt availability.  The FFR was negative in real terms (in relationship to true inflation rates) and off-shoring allowed for easy access to cheap labor on staples and manufacturing.  This allowed wages to be suppressed, even in non-staple industries.  An example is why your support phone calls to Dell are taken in Mumbai.  The CSR's are getting paid fractions of what US CSR's would receive for the same work.  


The COVID shut downs of 2020 came with unemployment at 3.5% leading into it.  However, there was stagnant wage growth at that time.  For reference sake, average unemployment from 1948 until 2015 was 5.8%.  The Federal Reserve targets 5% unemployment as its target.  Above that isn't necessarily healthy because it leaves companies short staffed and doesn't allow for wage growth in-line with the Fed's target inflation rate of 2.5%.  Since wages were not increasing at a rate commiserate with inflation in real terms and because social security payouts were so low as well in terms of pre-70 retirements, older folks were working longer.  Then along came COVID.  


COVID-based lockdowns caused massive layoffs, to the tune of a 12-13% spike in unemployment.  The US went from 3.5% to 14.7% unemployment basically in the course of weeks.  The easing of the lockdowns took over a year.  The Federal Reserve and Congress' response was to dump a ton of money in enhanced unemployment benefits, drop nominal rates to zero, and juice the stock market from a massive drop into a blow-off top with the S&amp;P hitting 4800.  Suddenly, a lot of 60+ year old's retirement accounts got a lot more valuable.  There was a lot of incentive to stop working for a lot of people who historically would have been out of the workforce 5-10 years earlier.  This is tied to a demographic issue based on lower birth rates tied to stagnant wage growth, higher debt levels, and higher quality of life and fundamental shifts in how people chose to live life.  


In lockstep, the outsourced staples and manufacturing had inflation problems because the labor issues spread globally as entire continents locked down.  The entire global supply chain got, for lack of a better term, FUBAR'ed.  This jacked shipping, production, and commodity prices, on top of what had been developing upward pressure on those prices due to global climate concerns.  This caused inflation which is still manifesting.  


Historically, inflation can't be tamed until the FFR is positive in real terms (rates above inflation rate).  We aren't there yet, but should get there by Q1 of '23.  History says a ""soft landing"" is not likely because the very thing the Fed has to do to tame inflation is recessionary.  Unemployment has to go up.  And that's the crux of why I am writing this:  
We're in a weird time, because unemployment isn't likely to give much of a care about rates.  Simply put, the available labor force has contracted dramatically.  And this isn't really tracked well.  In '20-'21 there were massive spikes in new company registrations, so a lot of people left the workforce to start their own little gigs, likely in many cases with zero rate debt for startup costs, and those likely aren't being tracked that well.  The stock market, which is essentially all very large companies, feels this strain the worst, because the only way they are going to keep up is by offering higher wages from the bottom to the top of their employment pay scales.  We will likely see continuing white-collar job cuts and continuing pay and benefit raises at the bottom, which vastly out number the top.  There is very little incentive these companies can provide without higher pay.  And no Fed changes will help this.  The job market is going to persist at a very tight state, the demographics demand it.  


All that will happen is that the Fed will tighten, even into real positive rates of 6-7%, and eventually the issue will be servicing US debt as a percentage of GDP.  It will hit a point, stop, and the pivot won't happen for a very long time back into easy monetary policy because the stagnation of the labor pool and avenues for self-employment contradict the large corporate structure that has existed to this point.  My personal investment thesis right now is to maintain exposure in solid, mature companies, preferably with dividends, emerging market exposure into places with positive demographic trends (India, South Africa), and buy bonds when the fed announces a stop to rate hikes because I think they will largely outperform the market in the 2-5 year term until the pivot to rate cuts (probably 2H 2024) due to political pressure and the ever increasing appetite by the general populace for entitlements.  
At that point, buying TLT will be how somebody could get very, very wealthy and since that is not some secret anymore, that could re-ignite the entire cycle.  Because it will happen at that scale.  Institutional money will absolutely clobber that trade.",finance,1670337968

economy,Jamie Dimon says inflation eroding consumer wealth may cause recession next year,"[JPMorgan Chase](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/JPM/) CEO [Jamie Dimon](https://www.cnbc.com/jamie-dimon/) said that inflation could tip the U.S. economy into recession next year.

While consumers and companies are currently in good shape, that may not last much longer, Dimon said Tuesday on [CNBC’s “Squawk Box](https://www.cnbc.com/squawk-box-us/).” Consumers have $1.5 trillion in excess savings from pandemic stimulus programs and are spending 10% more than in 2021, he said.

“Inflation is eroding everything I just said, and that trillion and a half dollars will run out sometime mid-year next year,” Dimon said. “When you’re looking out forward, those things may very well derail the economy and cause a mild or hard recession that people worry about.”

The veteran JPMorgan CEO began to raise concerns about the economy earlier this year. In June, he said he was preparing his bank for an economic [hurricane on the horizon](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/06/01/jamie-dimon-says-brace-yourself-for-an-economic-hurricane-caused-by-the-fed-and-ukraine-war.html), in part because of the Federal Reserve’s reversal of bond-buying programs and the Ukraine war.

Adding to pressure for borrowers, the Fed’s benchmark interest rate is headed to 5%, Dimon noted Tuesday. That rate “may not be sufficient” to subdue inflation, he added.

During the wide-ranging interview, Dimon called cryptocurrencies “a [complete sideshow](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/dimon-calls-crypto-a-complete-sideshow-and-tokens-are-pet-rocks.html)” that is rife with criminality and said globalization was in the process of being partly reversed as supply chains are restructured amid heightened geopolitical tensions.

personalfinance,Fix traditional IRA with commingled funds or not bother?,"We are early 30’s married filing jointly. 22% marginal federal tax rate and 5% state. Current employer does not offer a retirement plan. I had approximately $10K in each of two former employer plans (pre-tax 401(k) and 403(b)). I also had $10K in a traditional IRA and $20K in a Roth IRA. All 4 accounts are with different institutions, totaling around $50K, which is approximately equal to 1 year salary (pre-tax). 

In an effort to consolidate and simplify accounts, I rolled one of the two former employer plans into my traditional IRA (direct via trustee-to-trustee). I was preparing to also roll the other former employer plan (also direct) when I learned commingling employer-sponsored and personal contributions has some disadvantages.

As the rollover occurred within 2022, I think I should be able to open a new ‘rollover IRA’ and have the assets moved out of my traditional IRA to isolate the employer-sponsored from the personal contributions. I am considering doing this partly because I was thinking to roll the assets back into a future employer sponsored plan, and some (most?) will only accept incoming-assets from rollover IRAs (and not a personal IRA).

My question is if it is worth it to separate the commingled funds or not to bother. I’m currently in a paid training type of position but this will end within the next year or so and I will begin to earn approximately 1–2X more (bumping to 24% marginal federal tax rate) and also covered by an employer sponsored retirement plan, likely with a match. I expect to work an additional 35 years. Assuming I contribute to a 401(k) for 35 years, is it such a problem for $20K of employer-sponsored funds to be in a personal traditional IRA? 

Also note that I am diverting current IRA contributions to my traditional and not my Roth IRA. This is partly because I will, at the very least retire, if not move within the next few years to a state without income tax.

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks!",finance,1670348830
economy,What Do You Think We Should Do About Student Loan Debt?,"With all the talk and debate around the topic of Student Loan Debt, I wanted to see if we can move away from this being a binary discussion of ""should or should we not cancel student loan debt"" and into a space of “*how* do we make this a reality?”

My idea(s):

1. We collectively refinance all existing student loan debt at a 0% interest rate.
2. We calculate the interest accumulated over the life of any remaining student loan debt and apply it as a credit toward all of the remaining principal balances. That is, starting with age, the oldest debt holders first, and we work our way back. Reason being? Prevent further, ""Supplemental Security Insurance Garnishment""
3. What about those in school right now? Any individual attending higher education would be included in this collective 0% interest rate refinance. Reason being? You can't put measures in place that help those who hold student loan debt and that are currently paying off but not help those who are poised to be the next in line with the same issue.
4. What incentive is there if the issue is only temporarily resolved by canceling the debts of those who hold it now? We'd be in the same discussion years down the road without a clear pathway to resolution for future generations, wouldn't we? Or what incentive does anyone who is thinking of going to college or returning to school have? All student loans should be issued with a 0% rate.
5. What about the educators, support staff, and everyone that makes the school function? Every one of those on the payroll in the education sector, such as, daycare providers, elementary school staff, high school staff, trade school staff, college staff, and university staff is exempt from paying federal or state income taxes.
6. Lastly, the age to legally purchase and consume alcohol, nicotine, cannabis, or any other decriminalized/rescheduled substances in the past or in the future, gamble, or purchase/own firearms would be increased to the age of 25; no exceptions to tribal land. But why 25? It's the age at which the brain becomes fully developed and we need all of you young kings and queens out here to succeed!

IMO, the goal here is to get more information into the heads of the students as inexpensively and effectively as possible while protecting their minds in the process.

Thank you for making it this far and wishing you all a wonderful day!

CryptoCurrency,The lies of Bitcoin Maxis,"##Bitcoin is a store of value/inflation hedge##

Except when you need it, in an inflationary environment with rising prices **like today.** Then they tell you they mean in the long term. No mention of how long. My pet rock is also an inflation hedge and store of value in the loooong term. See how these claims with no time parameters are essentially unfalsifiable? Stop using the ""store of value/inflation hedge/preserve my savings"" bullshit because it's fycking stupid.

##Bitcoin gives you property rights##

So go live in your fycking bitcoin then.

##Bitcoin is real money/apolitical money##

Bitcoin isn't a good medium of exchange due to it's volatility and has no adoption. Ytf would I want to spend my btc ever? Bitcoin could never function as a money in a nation or state either. Inflation is needed to stimulate the economy. I can't even count how many times I read one of them 🦜parrot the same narrative they heard from their priest Trader University ""inflation always bad. guvmint print moneys and devalue my moneys"".  

There's also the scalability issues of Bitcoin and before you go ""Lightning Network tho"". LN is still not widely adopted and still not free from security risks, vulnerabilities and poor user experience. 

Bitcoin is just another speculative asset that's closely correlated with the Nasdaq100 and the S&amp;P500. I personally like to think of it as a levered S&amp;P500. 

Bitcoin could never function in a business either. Business owners need to pay for their materials or labour's in fiat. You can't run a business on a volatile asset like btc. Stop it.

##Bitcoin isn't about the price##

This is such a load of 🐂💩. The Miners incentives and the security of bitcoin is dependent on its price. Bitcoin is literally only about the price and number go up. Otherwise it would be stupid. 

##No one can steal your bitcoin##

Except if they torture your dumbass for a few ~~days~~ minutes.

##Bitcoin doesn't harm the environment or is even good for the environment##

So this argument is dealt with by using a lot of 
Whataboutisms ""what about all the Christmas lights"". Some bitcoiners like Saifedean Ammous have gone as far as climate change denial despite the scientific consensus on the issue.

 There was a coinshares report a while back that bitcoin has 0.08% of global carbon emissions. I've heard the arguments about Bitcoin using stranded energy and stabilizing the grid and also the Bitcoin mining and gas flaring thing so 🤷‍♂️

I personally don't have a strong opinion on this except to say that even though the energy use may not be that bad. It's still energy being used for a speculative greater fool asset. Not some noble mythical holy revolution like Bitcoiners make it out to be.

##Bitcoin is not a cult##

If you want to see a live demonstration of cultists, you only have to visit the Bitcoin subreddit. There the true believers proclaim their undying conviction in Bitcoin and that they will never ever sell their bitcoin and that all altcoins are scams or how all fiat is worthless etc.. They have an ingroup and an outgroup labeled nocoiners and they're even hostile towards general crypto enthusiasts. Twitter bitcoiners are known for their toxicity but I see it as just a cultish behaviors. Not surprisingly the Bitcoin sub is also heavily censored.

They worship their selfless prophet Satoshi who gifted the world with his invention and never took a penny for himself. Satoshi had libertarian ideas and all the maxis are also libertarians. A lot of them happen also to be freedumb lovers and into ""self sovereignty which apparently means storing your own bitcoin and dreaming about some ideal future of homesteading with guns and cattle. 

 Many of them are deep into conspiracy rabbit holes as well. A lot of financial conspiracy theories about the central bankers, financial elites and secret societies that control the world and keep the poor man like themselves down in the dirt.

Many believe in this grand event called the Hyperbitcoinization where everyone will get on the Bitcoin Standard for some reason and they are preparing themselves for this Holy Day by stacking sats. 🤦‍♂️ Such a dumb and childish cartoon fantasy. 

##Bitcoin is not crypto##

 Another stupid 🐂💩 line. Bitcoin is based on cryptography. It's the first crypto. It has a unique investment narrative from the the other cryptos  but at the end of the day it's just a crypto. Get over it.

##This is what Bitcoin actually has##

It has a limited supply and a pretty predictable rate of issuance. It's verifiable scarce and also very secure because of the massive amount of energy it guzzles. That's it. That's all it has going for it. And yes, you can think of it as some kind of a digital gold analogue. But that's it. 
Stop making bullshit philosophical claims about it. 

##Why I continue stacking sats##

I'm buying bitcoin because my thesis is that the fanaticism of this cult will never end. They will always be able to recruit newer cultists with their utopian delusions. Bitcoin is just another narrative driven asset and really it's just a belief system at the end of the day.",cryptocurrency,1670349867

I feel like I already know the answer to this, but I have some questions I would like a second opinion about.

I just applied for a personal loan through USAA for $10,000 and was approved on these terms:
All loans at 17.54% APR

$359.22 on 36 months
$291.35 on 48 months
or $251.44 on 60 months 

Ideally I want to throw at least $400 a month towards this loan to pay it off quicker. But my questions here are:

Is consolidation worth it given these terms?
At $400 min. per month, are one of these loan plans better than another?
If I accept the loan, does it make the most sense to pay off the 
Amex in full and freeze/cut the card up? Or leave a little bit of balance? Or just make larger payments monthly?

economy,Are We Better Off Now Than At Any Other Time In Modern History?,"I came across an article by Arthur C. Brooks published in the Atlantic from 2020 titled ""Are We Trading Our Happiness for Modern Comforts?""

While I tend to like this type of article that takes an analytic, data-driven approach to something subjective like happiness, I was having a hard time buying the initial statement that: 

*""According to the United States Census Bureau, average household income in the U.S., adjusted for inflation, was*[ *higher*](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/historical-income-households.html) *in 2019 than has ever been recorded for every income quintile. And although income inequality has risen, this has not been mirrored by*[ *inequality in the consumption*](https://www.nber.org/papers/w23655) *of goods and services. For example, from* [*2008*](https://www.bls.gov/cex/csxann08.pdf) *to* [*2019*](https://www.bls.gov/cex/2019/combined/quintile.pdf)*, households in the lowest income quintile increased spending on eating out by an average of about 22 percent after correcting for inflation; the top quintile increased spending on eating out by an average of just under 8 percent. Meanwhile, domestic government services have increased* [*significantly*](https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/historical-tables/)*: For example, federal spending on education, training, employment, and social services increased from 2000 to 2019 by about 30 percent in inflation-adjusted terms.""*

I guess my gut instinct is that this can't really be true because people from older generations used to be able to put themselves through college working near-minimum wage jobs and did not have to go into debt to do so. I have always thought that the purchasing power of the dollar has declined since going off of the gold standard. 

What does the equation look like to see that household income was the highest ever in 2019?

What I am really trying to ascertain is something akin to ""quality of life,"" and have the data to back this up. Do Real Wages take into account purchasing power and inflation while controlling for increasing income inequality? In other words, is there a measure out there that eliminates the outliers of the super-rich or even the moderately affluent (maybe, say, households that currently make $250K and above) and gives a better look at the wages for working-class people?

My motivation for this is understanding what I can do to save money in the current state of the economy. I currently do not make enough money to save, and I am frugal. I have maintained that this inability to save money is a result of changing demographics -- the accumulation of wealth among the baby boomer generation with less to go around for subsequent generations -- and worsening economic conditions over the last few decades for the working class. I am 36 years old and have memories of my parents living much larger on much less -- though childhood memories are only sometimes a reliable source of information. 

Brooks' claims also seem to fly in the face of a recent Time Magazine article that said it is 40% more expensive to be single now than it was a decade ago. 

If Brooks's assertion is correct, I will abandon my current way of thinking and try to assess my financial predicament in other ways. I would love some guidance on this.

I made some absolutely terrible financial decisions in the past two years. No excuses, I just didn’t plan things out well enough. To provide context, I live in Los Angeles County and I do not drive as I do not have money for a car or even driving lessons. I graduated college in 2017 with a BA in Theater and Screen Studies. Stupid choice, I know. Tried to go to grad school for English, went for a semester and had to drop out after doing the math on loans. After that, I got stuck in a minimum wage job at a doctors office for about 2 years. I was working full time but still did not quite make enough to make ends meet and ended up racking up about $12k in credit card debt due to overall stupidity. 

I could not successfully land any sort of higher paying job until last year when I was able to get a retail job at a small business that pays $1.25 more and did not have to spend as much on transportation. For the first half of the year, things were going great. I was able to start paying small amounts that were more than minimum payment towards my four credit cards. Yes, four. 

Rent was raised a few months ago and it will be raised once again in February. Groceries have become more expensive. I cancelled my Disney Plus subscription and Amazon Prime subscription in the interest of affording Christmas presents for my 3 family members. Still, I can only pay minimum amounts on the credit cards and the interest rates essentially keep the cards at their limit.

Here’s a nice video of Charles crushing the kid from The OC (who is now a middle aged crypto critic) along with some other person who says that “crypto has ruined lives.” The actor basically thinks that every cryptocurrency is just a security.

20. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

24. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US.

31. Vitalik is worried about bugs in SC code and “most worried” about hacks of ZK-Rollups. I believe it’s obvious that ETH ZK-Rollups will generally be DnPs (“deposit and pray”).

personalfinance,Desperate for Student Loan Repayment Advice!,"Hey Everyone, I'm a 26F looking for help pertaining to my students loans/personal finance. I was a first generation college student raised by a single mom who knew little to nothing about student loans, FAFSA, debt, and credit. I made the mistake of going to an expensive private university but I graduated from my undergraduate degree in 2018 with a BS (bachelor of science in nursing) and grew into a pretty lucrative career as a registered nurse. I am due to graduate with my Master's for Women's Health nurse practitioner this upcoming May of 2023, this will most like double my hourly wage. I'm really desperate for help in regard to what I should do about paying off my student loans and money management. I currently have 128,935$ in student loans between my undergad/graduate degree with both federal and private loans. My private loans (approx $70,000) were through Wells Fargo who sold my loans to FirstMark and my interest rates are astronomically high between 8-10% and I have had them deferred since beginning my graduate degree. My federal loans I have been paying since I graduated from undergrad and during graduate school to take advantage of the 0% interest (approx 50,000) ...sometimes making 1,000$ payments to chip away. I currently have $53,000 in my savings and have been using it intermittently to maintain my lifestyle currently while I am clinicals for my graduate degree....so l'm working per-diem. My credit isn't the best because it has been difficult for me to establish credit, 685, so private loan refinancing options have been difficult for me.
Could anyone offer me ANY financial advice related to how to tackle your student debt? I even was thinking as far as enlisting in the military for student loan forgiveness...I'm just feeling overwhelmed by the numbers. I have so many coworkers and friends who's parents paid for their schooling or have very minimal loans so it's hard to find financial advice in my life right now.
I appreciate Any help in advance and let me know if I should provide any more information.",finance,1670396934

Going out to eat, endless cycle of caring too much then not enough, lifestyle creep, poor decisions, medical bills, you name it, I've probably doing it wrong.

Due to my stupid, the 15k from credit card 3 and 4 were just from the last 3-4 months.

I'm tried of giving away half of my check to someone else. 

$750 in my savings. (I had to use 250$ to get a new phone)

Insurance is double charging me for the next two paychecks to cover the time I was off.

I changed my 401k contributions to 0percent and have been using that said 9 percent (gross) to pay off credit card 1 and 2.

My car is also a few months ahead in payments, I've been using that 325 to catch up on whatever bill is due next.

I currently have 5 loans out that I can’t even make a dent in. For most of them, I have paid the principal balance but they have extremely high interest on them and I can not get ahead. I live in Delaware where I believe these loans are legal. The total amount I owe for all of these loans is $5469.83 (if paid off today) and my monthly payments all together is $811.66. I have listed below the each loan detail.

I am not able to ask family or friends for a loan and I have tried applying for other low interest loans but have been denied. In an ideal world, I would be able to take out one loan with an interest rate of anywhere between 5%-15%, pay off all these loans and make one monthly payment. I belong to a credit union and have tried applying online for a loan through them but have been denied in the past. I do not know if it would be more beneficial if I went in person to the bank and showed them the documents of these high interest loans?
Please, any advice is appreciated. I am sick to my stomach with how stupid I have been. I am barely able to pay for rent and utilities after all these payments. I have looked into the Borrow Reddit page but I don’t think I even qualify for a loan from there.

# [Stock futures fall Wednesday as recession fears continue to batter market sentiment](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures slid Wednesday, with traders fretting over the possibility of a recession as the Federal Reserve could raise rates for longer than expected.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were down 142 points, or 0.4%, while S&amp;P 500 futures lost 0.6% and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 1.1%.
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off another tough session, with the Dow falling more than 350 points, or 1.03%. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 1.4% and 2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors have been losing hope that the Fed will be able to engineer a so-called soft landing that successfully tamps down inflation through higher rates and also avoids a recession. Instead, concerns are swirling around the state of the economy and the likelihood of a downturn in 2023.
*****
&gt; “All told, financial indicators point to a recession on the horizon,” wrote Wells Fargo’s Azhar Iqbal in a note to clients Wednesday. “The S&amp;P 500 has peaked ahead of recessions with an average lead time of four months over the past few business cycles. Taken together with the inverted yield curve, markets are clearly braced for a recession in 2023.”
*****
&gt; Investors await more economic data this week for clues on what to expect from the Fed. Mortgage loan application data showed a decline last week despite a fall in rates.
*****
&gt; The tail end of earnings season continued with a solid report from Campbell Soup.

CryptoCurrency,Winter natural selection,"There are three main reasons to be interested in crypto: profit, technology, and philosophy.

As the global recession is confirmed, the different types of news will have a different impact on each of the groups:

- Profit-seekers will get pain: there are no quick gains in sight for 2023, no halving or major reasons for higher prices, no greed-driven mainstream adoption during a bear, and all the reasons for the bear and the winter to continue. We may see capitulation, liquidation of longs (and shorts), de-leveraging, and plenty of pain for anyone trying to make a profit in 2023 if anyone is still in that mindset.*
- Technology enthusiasts will get more technological improvements, as technical limitations were highlighted during the last bull run, without all the spam about too-good-to-be-true APYs and other marketing material to ~rob~ entice profit-seekers. As technology companies fire people in the tens of thousands, more developers are available for decentralization efforts than ever.
- Philosophy supporters will get a constant flow of news confirming their philosophical position against centralization: stagflation due to monetary policy recklessness, CEXes going bankrupt, corruption cases from all kinds of ~criminal~ official organizations, and all types of shit hitting the fan.

I do not think that there will be many people changing groups or interests within crypto, but I think:

1. people will be leaving or joining crypto based on these three reasons, and the share of each group will change cyclically, and possibly gradually converging to some ratio (oscillatory convergence),
2. this will be noticeable in the sub,
3. it will be positive, especially in the long-term, but also in the short term.

What do you think?

personalfinance,When should I expect a better credit score?,"Hi everyone,

I am currently 21 years old and hoping to graduate from University this upcoming May. I was having a conversation with my 22 y/o sister who told me she didn’t even have a credit card. This got me thinking about my credit, and I’m curious as to when I should expect it to be at a better number. 

Currently I have 2 credit cards and 4 accounts. My first card is a Discover card (I don’t remember if it is a student card) that I have had since June 2020. I have just under a $3000 limit. I’ve never missed a payment, never maxed it out, etc. I use it enough to make sure I have a payment every month (used it for all my Christmas gifts this year).

My second credit card is a JCPenney credit card. I haven’t used it in probably 2 years. The only reason I had it was I previously worked there, so I got huge discounts when combining the card, coupons, and employee discount. Once again, I never missed a payment or anything. Should I cancel this card?

My other accounts include a monthly auto lease payment and student loans. Student loans haven’t had any payments on them yet due to still being in college and the payment pause. These are only federal loans- I don’t have any private loans. 

The lease is for a 2021 Kia I got last year and runs until late September or early October 2024. I believe I might’ve been able to get the lease by myself, but the dealer recommended my parents cosign for a lower rate, so that is what we did. 

So anyways, are these decent steps for me? Should I be doing something different? Discover reports my credit score at 779 which I feel is too high, and Mint Mobile reports it at 738 which I feel is more accurate, but I am worried about needing cosigners or something for future loans even though I will be financially independent from my parents soon. 

Thanks!",finance,1670432420

personalfinance,I feel like I made a mistake buying a house in a lower COL area,"Up until a year ago, I was living in a HCOL area (Seattle) making 200k + illiquid equity in a private company that will likely not go public for another 3-4 years at least. The stated value of the equity was around $200k / year but I had counted on it being worth only about half that (with the tech bust, it's currently probably only worth a quarter or less of that). I wanted to buy a house but I was looking at paying $1 mil for a house I wouldn't even like that much, and more like $1.5 mil for what I actually wanted. I was living in a 500 sqft apartment with my young dog, and I decided while I personally could wait 5-10 years to buy a house, it wasn't fair to my dog to prioritize my own desire for a house in the Seattle area over her having more space and a yard. Her life is much shorter than mine and waiting 5-10 years would mean her not having a yard till she was old or, possibly, ever.

At the beginning of 2022, I moved to a lower COL area near where I grew up and bought a house for ~400k with a 3% 15 year loan. I put a third down on it and I'll have the money to pay it off in about 3 years (although with the low interest rate, I'm not going to do that). I love the house, it's everything I wanted in a house. But it's not *where* I want a house. Now, my effective salary (between COL-adjustment and state income tax, which WA doesn't have) is down 25% compared to living in WA, and I'm spending about as much on housing with my mortgage/insurance/tax/utilities as I was before, so I'm not able to save as much as I was before.

I'm approaching 30 and it seems unlikely I'd be able to move back to WA even if I wanted until I'm 40 or 35 at the earliest. By that point, I'll be settled here and I don't think it'll be a realistic option to move back. Ideally I'll be married or in a serious relationship by then and unlikely to be able to convince another person to uproot their life and move with me.

I love my house, I am very happy here, and so is my dog, but I feel like I made a rash decision to move across the country to somewhere I have no connections apart from my aging parents. The thought of giving up this house makes me sad, but it also makes me sad not living where I wanted to live. I've thought about maybe getting a cabin in the cascades somewhere, but in practice, this is the worst of both worlds -- I'm too far from the city to make connections there, and I'd be splitting my year between here and WA, so I wouldn't be able to make connections here, either. And I'd be paying two mortgages.

I realize this is probably on the more ""personal"" end than the ""finance"" end, but what are my reasonable options? Have others experienced anything similar? How did you handle it?",finance,1670433698
personalfinance,Saving For a Radical Lifestyle Change,"I know we're all told to max out all retirement accounts before doing taxable stuff. But I personally think it's worth considering having a large portion of funds that are highly accessible in the event that your employer goes off the deep end, or if you just completely fed up with work and need indefinite time off, or you want to make some type of radical lifestyle change that requires capital (e.g. invest in business, move to a different country, or van life).

If you only have a moderate emergency fund and all your assets are tied up in retirement, you significantly lose out on the flexibility to make radical lifestyle changes.

I personally take the full match for my 401k, but have paused contributing to IRA and have been saving cash and putting it into Ibonds and I might start contributing to my taxable accounts.

What are your thoughts on strategies to go about doing this the right way?

Also, this article seems to echo what I'm saying here.  And also makes the point that the opportunity cost of investing in a taxable account in lieu of a 401k is overrated.   https://ofdollarsanddata.com/should-i-max-out-my-401k/

investing,Earn 16% yields on afrm 12.50 covered calls expiring Dec 30,"As of Dec 7, 12:40pm’ish, affirm covered calls exp Dec 30, 2022 are paying 16% yields. If you bought this morning around $11.30 or lower, you are looking at closer to 20%. The stock is currently around $11.52.

My price target for the stock for the next four weeks is a range of 10-14. But I believe the stock will close the year around $14.

I turned very bullish on affrm and Bbpl after watching the YouTube channel Modern MBA further breakdown the business model. [Buy Now Pay Later Business Model explained](https://youtu.be/R1JaMRpcDrQ)


Bull case

-Buy now pay later is not going away. As recent holiday data has shown, consumers are using it more. The long term play here is for Affirm to onboard its members onto its new debt card which will lower their cost of borrowing. THE US ECONOMY IS AND REMAINS STRONG. 

-If afrm starts charging higher interest rates which I believe it has enough pricing power to do, that will greatly improve its finances and margins.

-if affirm starts charging interest rates similar to credit cards, affirm would be profitable within a quarter or two.

-Unlike other bnpl companies, afrm has the most market share of American consumer which are the most profitable in the world.

-I expect a rally to close out 2022 like the last three years.


Bear case

-A 100 basis point interest rate hike will send the market down and afrm stock to sub $10, but probably not lower than $9. 

-A bad and deep recession and mass unemployment. But even so, this data isn’t coming out until Jan or Feb.


My thesis

Fair value for the stock in my opinion is around $12.50 but I can see it ranging between $10-14. It’s also a good proxy for spy and economic data/news. With 16% yields, should be worth the risk. I do recommend hedging a bit. Buy puts outright. If you can stomach volatility, buy a lot of put spreads at the money or 2 strikes below it. Hedging will cut your yield down to 8-10% but you’ll be able to sleep at night with a 20% margin of safety. 


My current position

I got greedy Monday. Entered into the trade for a quick flip but had an issue where TD wasn’t letting me carry out the trade due to funds not clearing until the next day, so I couldn’t buy puts exp end of the month instead of this week. 

-13.5c exp this Friday that I intend to roll 

-Hedged 60% of the position with 13 and 13.5p exp Friday and 13.5p exp Dec 16 I sold earlier. I also have 13/12.50 put spreads exp Dec 16 accounting for 25% of my position.

-My cost basis is around $12.90. Yea, I’m down, 5.26%, but afrm is a momentum stock. The stock will either hit $9 to $15 next week. If it drops, I’ll average down. I do think the Fed will ease up a bit and we only see a 50 point hike. I’m around breakeven since I earned 5% doing the same thing last week.",finance,1670437433

personalfinance,Buy or Continue Renting in High Cost of Living Neighborhood? (seeking advice),"Hey /r/personalfinance,

Long time lurker, first time poster. 

My wife and I are debating about buying a home or continuing to rent. Our combined income is ~$260k (pre-tax) and we have a young son who will be turning 2 in the new year. We currently live in a rent stabilized apartment in a high cost of living NYC neighborhood (our rent is $2200/month for a large 2 bedroom). We have no credit card debt and a small amount left on our student loans, which we will likely payoff sometime in early 2023. The only significant debt we have is $13k on our car which we bought in the summer of 2020 and have a 0% interest loan on for the next 3.5 years. 

We have ~170k in liquid savings and both of our retirement accounts are decently endowed. 

My question is, are we crazy for not buying anything? We want to continue living in our current neighborhood, but anything we would buy would wipe out most (if not all) of our savings. Some of our friends have left for the suburbs and think we are crazy for staying in the city, but we love it here. We live in a family friendly neighborhood, very close to a beautiful park, and both have relatively short commutes to our jobs. Also, we have lived here for a decade (we are both currently in our mid-30s). 

We'd like more space eventually, but we are both ok with some of the inconveniences of city living, because we like where we live so much. Also, if we moved out of our place we would lose our rent-stabilized rate. Our rent currently can only go up 5% every two years if we keep renewing our lease. An equivalent market rate place in the same neighborhood or adjacent neighborhoods would be double the price. 

I feel this weird pressure from friends and family in the suburbs to leave, but we don't want to...are we crazy? Should we be more aggressive and attempt to buy something? We like having a decent savings account and we love where we currently live, even though the one downside is having a small amount of space for a family of 3. With interest rates as they currently are I feel like everyone else is crazy for trying to get us to buy something. 

I realize this is very much a first world problem, but I'm looking to get some perspective from all you good folks here. Thank you in advance.",finance,1670440561

I just started this job 6 months ago and they matched me at what I was making at my previous job. I just turned 26 this years so I am now paying for insurance, the benefits are mediocre, they don't start matching 401k until you've been here for a year (and only go up to like 4%) and you don't get the two floating holidays until you have been here for a full year as well. I was unaware of all of this when I took the position (I was unemployed at the time so honestly didn't care too much). I was told in my interview I would get the two floating holidays but I guess my boss was unaware that they policy had changed in 2022 and basically said ""oops, my bad"". I was also told during my interview that my job description would include ""other duties as assigned"" and it was made very clear that this was something that would be expected of me due to being short staffed (I work in mental health, so go figure).   
About two months or so ago the company restructured their pay policy and everyone got raises so now I am at $24.01 per hour. But, when I look at the job openings for the same position with the company the range states $24 - $30 per hour. So they literally gave me one cent more than the minimum.   
I have kept track of my stats since starting this job and know I am blowing everyone out of the water with number of patients seen per day. I am always the person my boss asks to take notes during meetings, do the quarterly CQI stats, and now part of the job I originally applied for but was declined since I don't have my Master's degree yet!

I cannot take out a personal loan, with my credit score (540) the offers are something ridiculous like 100% interest rate for only $5000 dollars or so.

 Is the debt consolidation plan mentioned a good solution. I am kind of shocked that after 7 months of $255 monthly payments with no missed payments they will settle all my accounts, is this true? And obviously this has to be the best option? NOTE: i was told that all my chosen credit card accounts will be closed but i can choose which to not include in this plan in order to keep my more higher end cards such as discover or amex for example which factors in to monthly payments regarding this program. 

Pls let me know your thoughts as id rather close all those cards which im told would take a small hit to my already low score and then slowly begin to raise then  keep them and continue to make monthly payments on my cards that are accruing interest rates every month and i dont make very much money. For context these are 8 or so cards minimum payments between $40-$80 which i end up having to use the balance for other bills anyways since i dont make much,

 $255 is obviously much less and more manageable. I was also told i wouldn’t have to make any payments on these cards for the next 90 days in order for the debt consolidation company to contact and come to settlement agreements with these cards as well as contact me with the settlement amounts just for information.

stocks,"Did Europe bottom? WSJ: ""Investors See Shift in Europe’s Fortunes.""","The market rewarded those who bought in the worst of the headlines of imminent winter freeze, gilt spiraling, runaway inflation. I still think there's more room for outperformance in the coming years. I personally added into international stocks quite aggressively this past summer and am now down less in VXUS than VTI and in the green for my ex-US small cap value ETF. And unlike the US, the stocks in Europe are already very cheap. [I wrote more about this a few months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/wk4aa5/market_timers_this_post_is_for_you_the_relative/) and the broader [emerging market](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/v0fq50/ft_emerging_markets_hit_by_worst_selloff_in/) when conditions were even worse. 

Now, the [article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-see-shift-in-europes-fortunes-11670409163?mod=markets_lead_pos5).

&gt; Investors are turning somewhat more positive on Europe, spurring a recovery in the region’s beaten-down stocks.
&gt; 
&gt; As of Tuesday’s close, the benchmark Euro Stoxx 50 index had **gained nearly 19% this quarter**, putting it on track for the **best quarterly performance since 2009**. The rise for the index, which includes eurozone blue chips like L’Oréal SA and LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE, compares with a **9.9% gain for the S&amp;P 500**. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/13ilMHL.png).
&gt; 
&gt; The mood has brightened after a period of extreme pessimism about Europe, brought on by the invasion of Ukraine, a subsequent jump in energy prices and the highest inflation in decades. Russia was the biggest energy supplier to the European Union, rendering the region vulnerable to shocks from Western sanctions.
&gt; 
&gt; Market sentiment is being lifted by early signs of inflation easing in the eurozone and hopes that the scramble for alternatives to Russian natural gas has reduced the risk of an energy crisis this winter, investors and analysts said. Meanwhile, benchmark U.S. yields and the dollar have declined in recent weeks, helping lift riskier assets worldwide, as investors anticipate a slowdown in the Federal Reserve’s campaign to raise interest rates.
&gt; 
&gt; “We’re in a recovery trade. There’s still going to be a recession. But what we’re seeing is signs that the recession won’t be as bad and that inflation might calm down more quickly than people thought,” said Jordan Rochester, a currency strategist at Nomura.
&gt; 
&gt; Foreign investors have snapped up European assets. In a marker of that international appetite, **flows into exchange-traded funds** holding eurozone-based stocks, but which are denominated in other currencies, rose to the **highest monthly level since early 2021** last month, Nomura analysis showed. [Graph from article](https://i.imgur.com/jissVrh.png).
&gt; 
&gt; The annual eurozone **inflation rate declined in November** for the first time since mid-2021, falling to **10%, from 10.6% in October**. A pullback in oil and other energy prices helped. Natural-gas prices have stabilized as Europe’s gas storage has risen above 95% due to imports of liquefied-natural gas, reducing the risk of an energy crunch.
&gt; 
&gt; Investors now expect the European Central Bank’s **key policy rate to reach 2.8% next summer**, market prices suggest, down from forecasts of more than 3% a month ago.
&gt; 
&gt; As in the U.S., where consumer-price inflation has also eased, investors are hoping that central bankers won’t have to tighten financial conditions so aggressively that they trigger a deep recession. In turn, expectations of a milder downturn and cheaper capital available to companies are boosting European stock and bond markets.
&gt; 
&gt; “The Fed and the ECB are winning the war against inflation, and at some point, we’re going to see a pause from the central banks. This is something that will drive the market higher,” said Roland Kaloyan, head of European equity strategy at Société Générale.
&gt; 
&gt; Some of the best-performing stocks in Europe this quarter are in the industrial sector. These companies were among the hardest-hit by the disruptions to gas supplies and jump in energy prices, with many companies temporarily shutting factories or reducing production.
&gt; 
&gt; Shares in France’s Alstom SA are up 43% this quarter, while those in Siemens Energy AG of Germany have risen 42%.
&gt; 
&gt; Some analysts expect other energy-intensive sectors to benefit from cheaper energy and the recent loosening of Covid-19 restrictions in China, one of the EU’s biggest trading partners.
&gt; 
&gt; “One of the sectors in which I see a lot of upside potential in Europe is the automobile sector,” Mr. Kaloyan said. He expects supply-chain conditions to keep improving. Europe’s major car makers include Volkswagen AG and Stellantis NV.
&gt; 
&gt; Conditions in the credit markets have also improved, with a decline in spreads, or the extra yields compared with a benchmark that investors demand to hold riskier bonds.
&gt; 
&gt; The **spread on an ICE BofA index of bonds in euros** issued by industrial companies **narrowed to 1.6 percentage points** above a benchmark. That is down from 2.1 points at the end of September, but still above the average 1.1 percentage point over the past 10 years.
&gt; 
&gt; Some remain cautious about the region’s prospects, for example if the Russia-Ukraine war drives more volatility in energy prices and inflation.
&gt; 
&gt; “The rally that we have seen was followed by the optimistic view that the energy crunch might not be as bad as we feared,” said Antonio Cavarero, head of investments at Generali Insurance Asset Management. “But Europe is still very much exposed.”",finance,1670455108
CryptoCurrency,Gensler Says SEC Is Fine Going After Crypto With Its Current Authority,"U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler isn’t waiting for new powers from Congress to enforce securities laws against crypto companies, though he said Wednesday it would be good to have more money and additional reach beyond U.S. borders.
Gensler, who declined to specifically talk about failed crypto exchange FTX and its former CEO, Sam Bankman-Fried, said in an interview on Yahoo Finance that the SEC has the basic disclosure and governance requirements in place to hold digital-assets firms accountable. The SEC chief also didn’t directly address questions about whether his agency would push out tailored crypto rules next year, but he insisted that it doesn’t need any.

“The rules are there,” he said. “The law firms know how to advise their clients to comply.”
As the fiery crash of FTX taught harsh lessons about the dangers of running a global platform without walls between customer funds and investment operations, Gensler underlined that crypto firms can’t do everything.
“Your field will not last long outside of public policy norms,” he said. “Some of these platforms have come in and said, ‘We want to continue running a commingled platform. We want to continue doing lending, trading, hedge fund functions, an exchange function, a custody function.’ We said, ‘No, you have to separate it out.’”

Gensler has expanded his crypto-enforcement team, though the agency hasn’t yet dropped a bomb on a major cryptocurrency platform. The court case over whether Ripple’s XRP is a security – and within reach of SEC authority – has been seen as the major lingering question holding the agency back. However, Gensler said Wednesday that a federal judge’s decision last month determining crypto startup LBRY violated securities laws by selling its native LBC tokens was a “very big win” for the SEC’s legal campaign.

So far, the SEC hasn’t directly gone after U.S. exchange Coinbase (COIN) for listing what the agency believes are securities without registering as a national securities exchange. Still, the SEC has – in another recent enforcement action – listed several tokens it considered unregistered securities that were traded on the company’s platform.
""If the SEC has the authority Mr. Gensler claims, why did he fail to uncover the largest crypto Ponzi scheme in US history?"" Rep. Ritchie Torres (D-N.Y.), said in a letter this week to the Government Accountability Office requesting a review of the SEC's role with FTX. ""One cannot have it both ways, asserting authority while avoiding accountability.""

However, Torres, a member of the House Financial Services Committee who is on the Congressional Blockchain Caucus, was also among lawmakers who sent a letter to Gensler earlier this year expressing concerns about how SEC investigators were gathering information from crypto companies.
Whether the SEC wants new laws or not, Congress has made crypto a new priority this year, and lawmakers from both parties are expected to push for the first major crypto legislation in the next session. Most of the preliminary efforts have sought to raise the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission into a prominent role in the oversight of crypto trading.

Gensler’s agency doesn’t need new crypto rules, he argued, adding that what would really help would be more resources and more powers over activity happening in other jurisdictions. The SEC already regulates $100 trillion markets – mainly in stocks, bonds and government securities – and no matter how much attention crypto is getting, he said Wednesday, it’s a relatively small market.
“Worldwide, it’s about $800-ish billion,” he said. “We don’t know the exact number in the U.S., but far smaller than the $800 billion.”

personalfinance,Early payoff with an ARM mortgage vs Refinancing,"Hi,

I have an interesting conundrum, we just bought a home at 5% 10/1 ARM for a balance of 562500. Simultaneously we sold our old home and stand to make about 263,000, closing date is in a week.

Mortgage payment starts 1/2023 and we are wondering what would be the best use of the 263000. I was looking at payoff calculators and it seems like if we drop the entire amount into our loan, we could pay it off in [10 years and 10 months](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=562500&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cinterestrate=5.000&amp;cremainingyear=30&amp;cremainingmonth=0&amp;cpayoffoption=extra&amp;cadditionalmonth=&amp;cadditionalyear=0&amp;cadditionalonetime=262500&amp;type=1&amp;x=90&amp;y=40#loanterm). Only caveat is that this is a fixed rate payoff calculator, not sure if it will count for us since we have a 10/1 ARM. My assumption is that for the first 10 years it will count after that its whatever is the state of the rates.

We both have retirement accounts that we max out every year, we also have 50k in emergency funds set aside. Combined income is 297,000 a year, however my SO has to travel to another state for work because her field here doesn’t pay well and demands more. We knew this moving here, because of the outsized value we can get from the property. She is a RN works 6 on and 8 off, so she travels 2x a month, spending about 1800 a month on everything combined.

The home that we bought is old(1978), right now we are re-doing the insulation and possibly a new roof. Somehow the inspector missed that an entire side of the roof was using sub-standard panels and insulation in the entire attic is blocked, so its just a giant mold fest up there.

We have enough in savings to stomach the 30k, but it has got me worried about other expenses down the line.

Our only other debt is a loan for my car, its got 35k on it at 2.29% left.

The other option would be to get a 30 year fixed and pay more on the months we can in order to arrive at a [similar payoff schedule](https://www.calculator.net/mortgage-payoff-calculator.html?cloanamount=300000&amp;cloanterm=30&amp;cinterestrate=5.750&amp;cremainingyear=30&amp;cremainingmonth=0&amp;cpayoffoption=extra&amp;cadditionalmonth=1400&amp;cadditionalyear=0&amp;cadditionalonetime=0&amp;type=1&amp;x=67&amp;y=23#loanterm).

What we had wanted to do was for one of us to go part-time in 10 year or retire, then the second one to follow suit after 5-6 years. We don’t have kids and don’t plan on getting any kids. Our current retirement accounts sit at a combined 600k, with one of us having dual pensions. Both of us have investment type life insurances as well, so that could also be a source of income down the line.

Our yearly expected income in retirement is projected to be around $60,000 using very conservative metrics(dying at age of 90). So if we do the 30 year option, we would be paying close to 22k a year, almost a third of our income in housing.

personalfinance,Determining if buying a car is a good option,"I could use some advice. I am looking to buy a car in the near future (ideally within 3 months). While my pay is good, my entire credit history is two (on time and in full) credit card payments. So essentially non-existent.

I'm looking at newer (2018 to 2021) economy cars like Honda civics and Toyota Corollas in the low 20k range.

My plan currently is to save up some more money to make a better down payment but an extra cc payment or two isnt going to make much difference on my credit history.

personalfinance,Help with available Vanguard Funds,"I'm trying to select funds that fit my needs through my company's retirement plan. It is a simple IRA.

I'd like to have a whole stock market fund like VTI (if I'm understanding it correctly), or something close to it. I've went through a lot of info and am having trouble trying to approximate this with the funds available to me.

I am not entirely against target date funds (2020 - 2070 are available), but I'm leaning towards a somewhat higher risk investment. However, I would *like* to retire in 25-30 years (may not be how it works out, based on current income and investments). I'm not sure if this puts me in the range of ""should not be making higher risk investments"" but from the little I know I feel that a much higher stock ratio in my portfolio at this time is better, and I can worry about safer investments several years down the road.

Any help in trying to approximate VTI or VOO with these funds would be appreciated. And any advice in the case that I'm under a terribly wrong line of reasoning is also appreciated!

Trading,A Chart Comparison - DJI - The Great Depression vs. Current Times,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share a chart comparison of the DJI between the Great Depression period and current times.

The chart similarities between the Great Depression and current times are quit concerning tbh. Notice how there was an M top pattern prior to the Great Depression, which was followed by a massive bull run. Fast forward to today's time with a similar M top pattern from the Dot Com bubble followed by another massive bull run prior to the retracement in price from the end of 2021.

I'm not a history scholar by any means but from my understanding during the 1920's electricity and cars were being mass adopted in cities which sparked a rise in consumerism. - This is similar to the Dot Com bubble in which the internet was mass adopted which cause another wave of increased consumerism.

In the 1920's after WWI and prior to the Great Depression, there was a massive spike in Government spending which ultimately catapulted the market to record new highs. - This is essentially the same thing we saw in the 2000's after the Dot Com bubble then the War in Iraq with record spending by the Government leading to one of the biggest Bull Markets in US history.

Now that we're heading into a recession, will we see a similar collapse in the US stock market as in 1929? Or will the FED step in prior to a cataclysmic collapse to save the day and turn the money printers back on? - I think we both know the answer to that lol

Hopefully I got the facts correct in this post, I'm a trader not a history expert haha but I thought the chart similarities and history comparisons were worth sharing. It really is amazing how even 100 years later the charts repeat the same patterns over and over.

Thank everyone I hope you enjoyed this post.

One for the primary DC, and one for the secondary DC.
My setup is as per the following hashicorp article: https:|/ developer.hashicorp.com/consul/docs/k8s/deployment-configurations/multi-cluster/kubernetes

However, when I go to use consul-k8s to uninstall consul on my secondary DC. I start to see errors that the primary
DC can no longer connect to the secondary DC.

This makes sense, as Consul has been uninstalled. However, after reinstalling and rejoining the WAN federation on my secondary DC. The errors continue in my primary DC, and the secondary DC starts to show errors saying it can no longer find the primary DC.

Is there a correct way to unfederate DC's/k8s clusters that are in a WAN federation over mesh gateways?

I'm imagining that scaling this up must be tremendously hard, as if you install something incorrectly, and you potentially had 50 secondary DC's. These DC's would all start to show errors as soon as one DC was removed.

This seems like and incredibly common use case, so l am assuming I am incorrectly using consul. However, I haven't been able to find any answers online.

personalfinance,"12k high interest debt, repossessed car, help!","My brother has struggled the past couple years with his finances, and I never knew the extent of it, but it has gotten to a point that he came to me for help. I don't have the numbers in front of me, but a rough breakdown of his finances:

* he has around 12k in debt spread across various loans and credit cards, all around 25%.
* he had his car repoed due to missed payments, with about 15k left on the loan.
* his take home pay is around 1900 a month.
* he lives with my grandparents, so he doesn't pay rent. 
* his credit score is sub-650.

Our strategy for trying to dig out of this hole:

* fix his habits and behavior. Meaning reducing spending on anything unnecessary, saying no to going out, no take out/delivery. Stop all credit card use. 
* find a second job. He's currently working 30 hours a week, there's no reason he can't work 50-60 hours. 
* call all the credit card companies and ask if they have any leniency/forgiveness programs or anything to reduce the rate. 
* explore balance transfer cards/debt consolidation loans. 
* pay down debt, avalanche method.

That leads us to the car. I honestly have no idea what our options are RE: repossession, but he can't get to work without it. My thoughts are:

* reclaim the vehicle asap from the repo company. Going to auction from what I've read seems like a poor choice, since it looks like he's liable for whatever isn't covered. Call the lender to figure this out.
* from there, sell the car and replace it with a lower cost car. 

Some other thoughts:
* I am willing to cosign for a debt consolidation loan or even pay out his debt out of pocket with repayment, if need be. I know this is a bad financial decision.

20. Charles straight killed it in that mega twitter space with a bunch of big crypto names by pointing out that Cardano and Bitcoin are good in all this because they’re actually decentralized which is what the whole space needs to pursue instead of a bailout. The whole crypto space needs to live up to the label of “decentralization” we slapped on this thing.

24. Humans often seem to value optimization of short-term growth over optimization of long-term growth. Even some Western Economists in the Cold War thought the USSR would outgrow the US. The crypto space is making the same mistake in undervaluing Cardano’s long term optimization.

# [Stock futures rise as investors assess risk of an economic downturn](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/07/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures moved slightly higher Thursday after the S&amp;P 500 declined for a fifth consecutive day and Wall Street evaluated the likelihood of a recession ahead.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures added 100 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 futures gained 0.4%, while Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4%.
*****
&gt; Exxon rose 1% as the oil giant it lifted its buybacks, while Chevron gained on a higher capital spending budget. Tesla slumped amid reports of shortened shifts at its Shanghai factory.
*****
&gt; “U.S. equity futures are trying to stabilize, and Treasuries are witnessing tiny profit taking, but the mood is still gloomy,” said Adam Crisafulli, founder of Vital Knowledge in a note to clients Thursday. “The problem for domestic stocks is the absence of catalysts – two inflation figures come Fri (PPI and Michigan expectations), but the real fireworks arrive next week.”
*****
&gt; Investors’ attention has shifted toward next week’s Federal Reserve policy meeting, where the central bank is widely expected to issue a 50 basis point interest rate hike. It’s a smaller increase than the prior four rate hikes, but may do little to alleviate concerns over whether the Fed can avoid a recession next year in its attempt to squash surging prices. November’s consumer price index, due Tuesday, should also provide more clarity on the direction of inflation.
*****
&gt; In the near term, Wall Street awaits the latest data on weekly jobless claims before the bell on Thursday. Economists polled by Dow Jones are anticipating claims to come in at 230,000, up slightly from the prior week’s total of 225,000.
*****
&gt; Traders expect most recent earnings results from Lululemon Athletica, DocuSign, Broadcom and Costco after the bell Thursday.
*****
&gt; On Wednesday, the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.19% in its fifth straight losing session. The Dow was virtually flat, adding just 1.58 points. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 0.51%.

personalfinance,Mortgage Re-payment - Pay back to the bank or Invest in bonds,"Hello Finance people!  


I recently bought a house for **350k**.  
I managed to secure a **3.6%** interest rate on my **30 years** loan, and I have the **rate fix for the next 10 years**. Meaning I'm going to pay about 1.6k month.  
The bank gives me the option to pay 10% of the initial lone back every year without any additional charge, 35k. 

I was now wandering if it is better to pay back the 35k every year or if it is better to invest those 35k every year in bonds that pay net coupons bigger than the 3.6%. (that would be a YTM of about 5.55%, 35% tax rate)

By my calculations;

Paying back to the bank the 35k every year, I would settle the loan at the end o year 8. Paying them about 61k in interest.

If I can invest in bonds for the same 8 years the 35k, at the end o year 8 i will have about 386k in Bonds that are paying about 15k year in coupon. (Always Compounding)  
At the end of year 14 I will have more cash in coupons than I've paid the bank in interest, and then I would start to cash out from the bonds 35k every year to pay back the loan, that would be settled by the end of year 18, this way.    
At the end of year 18 I will have the house, all the cash that I paid in interest to the bank back and about 340k in bonds that will pay about 15k year in coupons.

This sounds even a better plan if you consider that, I will keep the cash on my side, in case I loose my job or any emergency.  
Biggest challenges will be to find Yields of 5.55% or more and diversification.  
Can anyone spot any flaw in my plan?  
How would you do it?   


PS; I cant post prints of the calculations.

My mortgage is 3.25% on 30 year fixed.  (I'm a teacher so I wanted lower payment obligation to manage cash flow in lean times.)  My wife got a new job that pays her about as much as my take-home pay but it has not retirement or benefits. All of that will come through my job as public school teacher.  We can now do the following:

1. Max contribution to teachers pension--required so not really an option to change
2. Max contribution to 403(b)
3. Max contribution to 457
4. Max contribution to IRA(s) hers and mine
5. Max contribution to family HSA. 
6. Plus we own a rental house that currently nets about $12k annually

Essentially, we live off her salary and bank mine.  And we already have the emergency fund set aside.

My wife wants to stop maxing the 403(b) so that we can put that against principal on house we bought in 2022.  

I know the math is generally in favor in the market, but she has a psychological hangup on the interest we pay on the mortgage.  Plus, the 403(b) is down this year, so there's the added thought that we are losing money there, whereas gaining equity.  

We only put 5% down on house and she really wants us to get to drop the PMI.  We also have concern that we might end up a little underwater on the house in near term, but this is a long-term investment for us, so I'm not really sweating that too much.

Secondly. I have about $40k down payment fund in a HYSA making 3%. Considering I’m looking at 12-18 month before I buy is that the best place to keep the money or should I be looking into things like treasury bills or other options as I continue to add to the fund.

vet,Don’t Know What To Do,"TW: Putting down a pet

Hello! This is a bit of a heavy ask, but I have a 15 year old Golden Retriever x Labrador that is not doing so well. She freaks out when she’s in the car, so we get a vet out to her and the most recent check-up was nothing but bad news. 

So apparently she has cancer in her lungs, which is causing her to breathe through her stomach, and thus leading to her heart having to work more. Another thing the vet mentioned was that she has recently been having seizures. Ever since the visit, these have happened probably 3 times this week, growing gradually. Other things I can mention is she has a tumour on her head and she has had arthritis for a while now. The vet had also mentioned to make a decision as a family on whether to put her down or not.

My family feels like we should put her down because they feel that it’s cruel to keep her here. The whole situation sucks because before we were told this, everyone had complained about anything she did, and ever since she’s been living inside the house, I have been taking care of her. I feel like it’s more cruel that the people who hadn’t willingly fed her and had to jump out of their seat to take her to the bathroom are making her life’s decision and it sucks.

What I wanted to ask is, would it be cruel and selfish for my family and I to put her down? I’m somewhat opposed to it, rather hoping she could pass in her own time rather than us choosing even if she’s happy and pain-free (for the most part). I worry that she isn’t dealing with debilitating pain and is happy, yet we take her life. I don’t want to do that to her. I’m hoping I could just get some advice, even if I need to be told that euthanasia is the best option for her at this point. Thank you :(",cryptocurrency,1670521949

stocks,Patience and temperament beat more math and prediction,"Examples of actual bargain hunting might be useful for people seeing a new barrage of garbage headlines predicting recession, depression, the bottom being in, the fed raising rates, the fed pivoting, deflation worries turning into inflation worries, gas prices being too high causing a recession, oil prices being too low causing a recession, or Jay Powell doing a 540 kick flip while Tony Hawk is cheering from the sidelines.

So here's one that just happened recently, with new developments this morning...

# Part 1: The setup

Saga Communications (SGA), a radio broadcaster headquartered out of Gross Pointe (Detroit suburbs), just today declared a 2nd special dividend and a new variable dividend policy moving forward. But how did we get here?

***The founder died.***

SGA was a controlled company, with a dual-class share structure. Edward Christian, who had been there since the start (1986) and of course the 1992 IPO, owned the Class B shares with 10x voting power and otherwise identical rights. So, despite not owning anywhere near 51%, he controlled the company.

In the covenants was stated that upon the passing of an owner of Class B shares, the shares would automatically revert to Class A shares (1:1) as they pass on to the inheritence of Ed's choosing, with all the dividend and voting rights concurrent with an A share.

***In other words, when Ed passed the controlled company is no longer controlled.*** Now I (and I doubt anyone else) had any idea this was going to happen. I only knew it was not an unreasonable possibility, *as he was 78 yrs old*, and understood what would happen in that event by reading. The [DEF14A](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/886136/000110465922045692/tm223643-1_def14a.htm#tSOOC) gives a quick overview of executive compensation, change of control events, and the like.

As you can see, Edward was being compensated - ***enormously***. He pulled in an average stated compensation of $2.5 million the past 3 years, while the company's net earnings over those years averaged $7.5 million. His two hand picked lieutenants averaged about $800k (combined!) per year in that time frame. **Fully 1/3 of the company's net profit was going directly into the pockets of the top 3 officers**, the majority going to the controlling owner. Whether you believe the acumen and operational skills of these three gentleman warranted such enormous compensation is up to you, but this is not surprising or uncommon.

He controls the company, picks the board, and thus names his own pay. Only shame or fear of litigation might cause a person to reign in the excess.

None of this is new. Ben Graham talked about it nearly 100 years ago. Jay Galbraith expounded on it in The New Industrial State.

So what happened?

# Part II: The payoff

None of this was ordained. For all I (or anyone else knew) this guy could have lived another 20 years, and continued collecting 1/4 of the SGA's net earnings in compensation every year.

Almost immediately after the announcement, within a day I believe, FMR (Fidelity Magellan Research) - Peter Lynch's old firm - took a significant stake. I bought my shares for between $19 and $22, about 1.5 years ago. At the time, it was a reasonable bargain with a few potential upsides, a solid history of positive earnings, a great balance sheet, a decent franchise, and a variable history of dividends. Compared to their normal earnings ($2.25/sh or so), and considering the financial strength, this company traded at a bargain (low multiple).

Of the upsides, this change of control was one. The election spending on advertising was another. A return to normal from Covid (and reversion to the mean in earnings) was another.

Shortly after FMR took their position, the board held a meeting and declared a special dividend, $2. This morning they declared another $2 dividend, along with a ""variable dividend policy"". I'm not sure how that changes much, as they've paid variable dividends for years. I think it's double speak that actually means: *We recognize this company is now at the behest of large stakeholders and we're going to have to return more money to owners to save our board seats.*

Everybody is self interested (selfish). This rule has zero exceptions. Learn this, life and investing will make much more sense.

# Part III: Conclusions

This one could have gone several ways.

1. The stock could have stagnated for a long time, with nothing happening to prompt any revaluation, cash remaining tied up in the business, and executives continuing to siphon large portions for themselves and in support of the board, which was entirely at the behest of the CEO &amp; Chairman.
2. Some bad news could have come along, in which case the stock price may have dipped somewhat temporarily. It would be hard to imagine it falling too much for too long, as they did (even in the controlled company time) pay not insignificant dividends and were earning plenty to easily support what I thought was a rock bottom valuation, relative to the market.
3. As Walter Schloss used to say, ""*If I buy a dollar for 40 cents, something good might happen to me*."" In this case, it took about 1.5 years to play out. In the meanwhile, I collected a few dividends. Now after these two special dividends ($4 total, the second $2 being paid in January 2023) my cost basis is essentially $15.5/sh for a company that earnings $2-3/yr and pays most of that out in dividends.

It doesn't always work out this way. If you take 20 such situations, a few will sit for years and do nothing. One might go south on you. But in a basket of such opportunities, the majority will turn in your favor, sooner or later.

It requires patience and temperament, but nothing more than basic arithmetic and the willingness to investigate (read!). You don't need an Einstein IQ to do this. Read everyday and be willing to say No to almost everything.

personalfinance,Too much credit card debt - possible solutions?,"I (34M) am stressing a bit about my current financial situation. I managed to pay my debts down to a manageable level at the beginning of the year. However, I got a fairly lucrative job mid-year and went a bit overboard with my spending. I've kept meaning to chip away at it but now I've just lost this job, and on top of that I'm at ≈$20,000 CAD of credit card debt.  I immediately called AMEX to stop the card and to put me on their Financial Relief Program, which they've told me reduces the interest rate to ≈10% with minimum payments of ≈$180. However, in addition to this, I'm currently paying rent for an apartment at around $1800 (+≈$200 for additional monthly expenses) per month.

While I am desperately looking for another job, my former employer has offered me a modest severance package of ≈$6000. Some of this has to go towards my rent (should I give my two-months notice for the apartment as well?). I also have an unworn expensive luxury clothing item that is roughly valued between $6000-$10,000 on the secondary market, but I need to find a buyer for it and that may take time. Lastly, I am currently doing all that I can do sell whatever excess items that I have so that I can gather some cash to pay the balance.

I'm asking this subreddit to please kindly tell me what else I should do to make this situation better?

I've very much learned my lesson, and moving forward I am well aware I should use a secured credit card...

&amp;#x200B;

Bitcoin,Catalysts for Bitcoin 2023,"So from what I've gathered there's multiple catalysts for Bitcoin price next year despite a looming recession(which is a fact at this point).

First one is the halvening(obvious). By the end of 2024 there should be the peak and preceding that hopefully a long upward trend towards a minimum of 250k per Bitcoin. According to models that have a historical price accuracy of 90-99% Bitcoins value should peak at around 1m per Bitcoin in 2025-2026. Average recession lasts for around 10 months so by the time this one will be over Bitcoins price should be around 65k at the end of next year/beginning of 2024.

Second one is the GAAP-accounting standard. Next year this law will be improved so that companies that hold digital assets on their balance sheet will be able to write them at their fair value. Currently if the price goes down in value but jumps back up again companies have to write down the value of the digital asset and can't mark it up. Starting from next year it will be different which apparently has been a deal-breaker for institutional investors in the past.

Third one is the capital inflow of traditional investors like investment banks, pension funds, central banks, small/big countries and different funds. Currently holding digital assets in their portfolio is considered to be risky due to the absence of regulation/transparency/public disclosings. From the beginning of next year,(January?) The United States Congress will be having a session where the SEC and Congress will both fight over which entity gets to set the rules. They both seem to be in a hurry to be the first ones which is a positive for crypto investors as the institutions feel safer to invest.

The capital inflow should be somewhere around 1 trillion USD for the price to reach 65k at the end of next year. Current price would have to quadruple so approximately 1 trillion USD would be sufficient. Total amount of assets held by mutual funds in the US is 30 trillion USD. Germany has 2,62 trillion and UK &amp; Brazil and Switzerland collectively own ~4 trillion USD.
That's close to 37 trillion. If 3% of this would go to Bitcoin its price would quadruple. Another scenario would be where we would consider the multiplier effect(5x) of investing in the stock market in which only 200 billion of capital inflow from institutional investors would be necessary to reach a 1 trillion market cap (5x200 billion USD=1 trillion). (I included Switzerland because its central bank has said it's interested in acquiring Bitcoin)

There's a few other potential catalysts in the future that might shape the perception of cryptocurrencies to a positive in the coming year (Big countries like Iran/Russia adopting cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions and the pilot of CBDCs.. also Ukraine is one of the largest Bitcoin holders..) So there are multiple concrete things to look forward to in next year and especially the year after despite the coming recession. The biggest factors for a long bear phase are imo rising oil prices and interest rates until the end of next year. In addition to that revolving and non-revolving credits are at an all time high while the savings rate of Americans is at an all time low.. if the recession will last around 10 months it should be a relatively sound timing for the price to shoot up to 250k per Bitcoin during 2024.

The third picture is Metcalf's law which predicts the value to be minimum 100k by 2025. It's not as delicious as the other two models but still decent considering the fact that it would be the minimum value. According to this model the value would be minimum 1m USD during 2025 and hover above 1m until it reaches 10 during next decade.
These are just some thoughts, things I've gathered. Hope someone finds it useful. 
Cheers.",cryptocurrency,1670526733

&gt;The lawsuit represents the FTC’s most significant effort to rein in consolidation in the tech industry since prominent tech critic Lina Khan (D) became the commission’s chair and was expected to usher in a new era of antitrust enforcement characterized by a willingness to bring cases in court rather than pursue settlements with companies.

...


This represents the most obvious real-life answer to the people asking if the MS/Activision deal was free money (and how it isn't). It looks like Lina Khan might be looking to make a name for herself in pursuing antitrust action by going after more M&amp;A.

personalfinance,"Question about student loans, Biden’s relief plan, and mortgages","So I currently have ~$16,000 of federal student loan debt left to pay off and I just received that exact amount through a loan repayment grant I am eligible for.  This money has to be used towards my loans.  Previously, I was planning to get the Biden loan forgiveness for $7,500 that I paid towards my loans during the COVID payment pause (I’ve initiated a refund of the $7,500 that I’ve paid but it’s extra complicated because my servicer switched earlier this year so my current servicer is trying to communicate with my previous servicer).  But now the whole Biden thing is on hold and may not actually happen.  

I’m concerned that if I pay off my current $16,000 balance and my account is closed, I may miss out on Biden’s forgiveness if it ever does come through.

I am planning to start the mortgage pre-approval process soon and I assume it’s probably best to have my student loan paid off before that.  I’m not sure if having a small balance will impact the mortgage offer I get.

So I’m stuck between 
1) Paying off my loan and hoping that if Biden comes through, I’m still eligible to get forgiveness for what I’ve paid during COVID even though my account is closed. Some articles online say this should be possible.  I’m just nervous about missing out due to some technicality.  
2) Leaving a small amount of money in my loan account just to keep it open for now.  No interest is accruing right now and payments are still on pause.",finance,1670544574

personalfinance,"Recently married - are we realistic with our joint retirement and savings goals, and the method of that saving? (East Coast, USA)","I recently got married, yay!, and we're ready to start more seriously merging our finances and planning for the future. The personal finance flow chart has helped spark many of these questions, but I am hoping for some guidance on how much we should be anticipating to save for our near-term goals, if we are being realistic and/or are missing some big ""duh"" things, and how best to maximize our income to reach both our savings goals and our retirement funding goals, all while living our regular day-to-day life. 


I have tried to provide as much detail as I could, so I apologize for the post length. 


For some background, we live in on the East Coast, are in our upper 20s/early 30s, no debt or car payments, and we rent. I make $90,000 with the potential of a not guaranteed annual bonus of around 10% of my salary, and he makes $123,000 with no bonus potential and works for the federal government. We collectively have about $15,000 - $20,000 in cash across various checking/low-yield savings accounts as our emergency fund and do not plan to continue increasing this right now while we focus on other savings goals. 


I contribute 11% to my work 401k, with a match of 6%. I max out my Roth IRA with Vanguard each year, so $6k currently. He contributes around 4% to his work 401k, and I'm unclear on their matching right now. 


Outside of retirement, our current savings priorities are:

1) down payment for a home in ~5-6 years, although not 20% with the way prices are right now. Maybe around $70k with more set aside for closing costs, immediate furniture or appliance needs and upgrades, and unforeseen ""oh shit!"" maintenance emergencies within the first year or so. I'm not sure what that ""more"" would amount to realistically anyway, so maybe a total savings of $100k between the down payment and those other items? Is that realistic? Too aggressive or too gun-shy? 


2) down payment for an electric car in ~1-2 years as a replacement to his current very old car that's on its last legs (thinking for 2 years saving, maybe have $25k for downpayment/tax and titling, with $5-7k extra for a safety net, so maybe $30kish?)


3) potentially having a baby in ~4-5 years, with consideration of not just the birth itself (especially given America's healthcare system), but also being able to buy the items we need for a newborn, and pre-emptively saving for some initial daycare costs. No idea on this one, maybe like $25k - $30k? 


The current plan has been to simply budget a portion of our paychecks for each of these items and watch the savings build over time in our normal checking/savings accounts, but my question is, can we do better than this? How? Should we prioritize the more immediate savings goals over retirement for right now? 


If we should be prioritizing savings goals, would that mean we only contribute up to what our companies match us for 401k for now, and me also not contributing to my Roth IRA and use the ~$6k instead to put towards one of our savings goals? Or should I continue the Roth IRA but just not focus on maxing it out? And should we be opening one for my husband too? I have a work 401k and the Roth, but he has only the work 401k so should we be focusing on being more ""equal"" in terms of our dual retirement savings? 


We are nearing the combined income limit for Roth IRA contribution eligibility, so I have considered opening a traditional IRA and doing a back door conversion to Roth, but that sounds much easier if I have the full $6k at the beginning of the year and deposit it just once and convert it right away. I don't have that saved up for 2023 though and usually budget monthly contributions to meet the maximum over the course of the year. Or is there another way of retirement fund saving you'd recommend we shift to? 


Should we look into a health insurance plan during 2023's open enrollment that has an HSA option? If so, what things should we be considering for an HSA when looking at the options? Or is this not a priority at this time given our income and our other measures of savings? 


I don't know anything about investing, or buying CDs or anything like that. I am quite risk-averse, and while he's a little less terrified than me, it's only just. 


I appreciate you staying with me so far, and I apologize if this is too in the weeds for a post. Just looking for some specific input or guidance based on my and my husband's actual lives!",finance,1670555211

&amp;#x200B;

**Thoughts on FTX, Alameda and regulations**

* It was a classic fraud.
* It’s bad for the short-term and it’s around 6-9 months of setback.
* The market is going to pivot from lending and enormous VCs to better CEXs and DEXs and less excess in terms of lending and activity.
* For these types of events, the non-crypto enthusiasts are skeptical of crypto and often those in the industry find themselves back against the fence.
* Stablecoins are like the third rail regulatory topic in Washington.
* Suspecting they’ll chop it up and try to figure out something for spot crypto exchanges and the DeFi stuff will be harder and take longer.
* This is unfortunately like a two steps back, one step forward towards regulations.
* It shows that without proper regulations and clarity that all people have been asking for a long time, it’s letting these bad actors find their way into the industry and flourish in a very negative      way.
* [Grayscale](https://twitter.com/Grayscale) is a legitimate business and we can all model their revenues because we know what assets they have, what they’re earning and that’s not going away.
* The contagion story feels like it has calmed down a bit over the past few weeks.
* The market hasn’t seen the end of the black swan events yet.

&amp;#x200B;

**Coinbase’s massive opportunity**

* [Coinbase](https://twitter.com/coinbase) is one of the most phenomenal companies in the U.S.
* If you have a bunch of people with money who’ve entrusted your organization to hold that money, there are ways to monetize besides the most basic way of engaging in transactions.
* Coinbase’s user count in the past cycle was 20 million and now there’s 100 million.
* It is the most important exchange in the world and it has the largest assets on the platform.
* People are looking at the wrong metrics, they’re looking at short-term revenues and transaction costs.
* The trade-off using Coinbase app rather than self-custody wallets is the ease of use, being able to detect your bank account seamlessly and honestly the comfortability of a U.S. company.
* It’s cool that they offer Web3 native features like decentralized app store or offer Coinbase wallet to access [Uniswap](https://twitter.com/Uniswap) and avoid using Coinbase platform.
* They’ve 10x monthly transacting users vs. where they were in 2018.
* They’re leaning into straddling that line between CeFi and DeFi.

 

**Bitwise’s Crypto Funds**

* Bitwise is trying to build a product that serves a role for people who aren’t all-in on crypto all the time.
* Built the index, diversified it and it rebalances every month.
* There are 7 screens that they use and the biggest ones they have screened for are the assets that might have risks of being in violation of federal securities.
* Spent a lot of time focusing on education and keeping updated over everything that’s happening.
* The broader financial industry is on adopting crypto.
* Doing a lot of research on product and strategy in the space.

&amp;#x200B;

**Client Interest**

* One thing that’s been really true over the last 12 months is that the category is growing rapidly.
* The biggest shift has been moving from $BTC only to $BTC and $ETH.
* Many financial advisors and family offices are more interested in $ETH than in $BTC.
* There’s more interest in L2s and a fair amount of interest in DeFi.
* There’s very little interest in NFTs.
* There’s a little bit of a lag between what everyone is excited about in the crypto industry and where that excitement falls in the traditional mark.

&amp;#x200B;

**Custody, Governance and Fund Allocation**

* All of Bitwise’s assets are custodied by third party institutional qualified custodians.
* The Bitwise 10 or BITW is in custody with Coinbase institutional, the DeFi fund is custody with Anchorage and the Bitcoin fund is in custody by Fidelity.
* They are a very conservative asset manager.
* The partners that they use for custody have to be able to support participating in governance while still safely and securely storing those assets in cold storage.

&amp;#x200B;

**Multichain vs. Cross chain future**

* Users and capital don’t really want to aggregate across a bunch of different L1s and app chains, it’s not a great user experience seeing there’s a lack of security in bridges and having to take on risk      just slowly moving from blockchain to blockchain.
* Ethereum would be the largest and they are definitely bullish on L2s and scaling solutions.
* [Cosmos](https://twitter.com/cosmoshub) is radically different and a completely different architecture.
* It would be foolish not to diversify to some of these other interesting architectural approaches.

&amp;#x200B;

**Crypto’s Next Big Unlock**

* It’s going to be a combination of 3 different things, one is increases in regulation that makes it safer for people to mainstream into it, second is throughput or cost of transactions and lastly, new applications.
* The preconditions today look better than they ever have in the history of crypto.
* The expanse of the stablecoin ecosystem has gotten and how much liquidity there is in the stablecoin ecosystem across different stablecoins is really bullish for the space.
* The most bullish for the next cycle are Dynamic NFTs because it takes the conversation away from price speculations and more about benefiting from the utility.

 

**DeFi narrative**

* DeFi applications are software but are like businesses in a way.
* In order for them to continue growing, they do need to generate some kind of clash flow.
* Tokens embracing cash flow models are needed to get DeFi applications from a single use case or single protocol to multi-vertical businesses that are growing, flourishing and sustainable.

I’ve been told that we should file jointly at the federal level but married filing separately at the state level. My question is, which home do we use for the federal return??

personalfinance,"If I get married mid-year, do we get the marital tax cut until next year?","Hi PF!

Me an my fiancé are moving soon to the US and we were planning on getting married in April. But, from what I’m reading, it is my understanding that our tax marital status for the year is decided on our status as is in December 31.

Do I understand correctly that it means if we get married in April we won’t enjoy the marital tax cut until next year? What we're worried about is our monthly after-tax income.

Thanks for reading.

Edit: By marital tax cut I mean, when I calculate the taxes on my next-to-be income on smartasset.com I get a 6% reduction on Federal Taxes if I choose Married Marital Status instead of Single. From the comments I see this is because I'm the only one with income, as she'll be on a Spouse Visa and unable to work.",finance,1670602155
personalfinance,Can a bank charge me interest on a loan that I did not yet receive due to processing delays?,"I took out a personal loan and for some reason there has been processing delays due to the Federal Reserve for me to have received them and that it will take an additional 5 business days. This is what the bank representative told me.

It doesn't seem right to me that they would charge interest on the loan until I actually received it.

When I brought this up, they kept repeating ""we charge interest from the time we disburse the funds"" (over and over) but how can they do that if their customer doesn't even have the funds in the first place?

The supervisor I talked to said she would not give me a refund on the interest charged to me during this delay. What can I do? Is there some law I can point to in order to get the interest waived?",finance,1670603209
personalfinance,Is there any reason to not have a High Yield Savings Account?,"My Chase savings account gives laughable interest (less than .1% or something absurd), whereas the Discover High Yield Savings Account has an interest rate of 3%. Am I missing something? Is there any reason to not move my savings there and get what seems like free money? And how/why would a bank offer this to begin with - this seems like a free service where they give you free money for doing nothing? What’s the catch/what am I misunderstanding?",finance,1670603893
personalfinance,How can I best take advantage of a great credit score?,"I'm 29 years old. I've paid off my car entirely. No debts at all. No mortgage because I rent. I have two credit cards which I use for almost every purchase I make, but I pay them off in full each month. I have never missed a payment. Because of this, I've got a pretty good credit score. Mint says it is around 790, which may not be accurate to the T, but I know it is pretty close.

I'm not ready to buy a house for a few years, partially because of the crazy prices and interest rates right now, but also because I'm not ready to lock myself down just yet. I also love my car and don't plan on buying a new one for a few years as well, still got low mileage on it.

I am wondering if there is some other way I can take advantage of my high credit score? If I had any sort of idea on how to use it, would a personal loan be a dumb move because of the interest rates? Perhaps I shouldn't be actively looking for ways to spend money, but I want to make sure I'm not leaving money, or opportunities, on the table. But if the best thing I can do is chill out, so be it! Appreciate your responses.",finance,1670604137
personalfinance,Are we on track for retirement?,"I am 40 and have a disability along with on again and off again medical issues, which has kept my salary much lower than where I thought I'd be at this point in my life.  My wife is 37 and works as well.  I will be making around $60k when I start my new job next week, as I lost another job because of my medical issues.  My wife makes around $50k as a teacher.  We both currently have credit scores over 800.

Current bills:

$200k House Mortgage 2.5% - $400k value

$37k Condo Mortgage 3.625% - $125k value - not a rental property, family lives here for free

$21k Car loan 1.99% - $39k trade in value

$20k Credit debt - this fluctuates greatly depending on my job situation from no debt to pretty much right now being one of the highest.  This is still well under 30% utilization. - $7k of this is on a 0% transfer until 2024, $5k is various charges on 6 month 0% financing, and the remaining is on various cards with the worst interest rate being 12%.

&amp;#x200B;

Retirement accounts:

$72k Roth IRA - I put in a minimum of $200/month regardless of the situation.  This is my oldest account and has been with Vanguard the entire time.  It is currently sitting at a 12.9% 10yr return.

$152k 401k, currently rolled over to a 457 as my last job was government - when I am working a job that I can contribute, I typically do whatever + match puts me at 20%.  My new job doesn't have a match, but puts in 3% per check regardless and is 100% vested same day.

$100k 403b - wife's account, not sure what her contribution is, but she gets an extra $4k a year thrown in since we don't take her benefits.

Wife will also get a pension.

$0 HSA - was drained due to my recent medical issues

stocks,"With everyone so focused on inflation, no one is talking about growth","Inflation and rising interest rates was the big story of 2022. As we approach the end of the year, and the Fed terminal rate of 4.5-5%, people seem to be cheering the death of inflation, but they're conveniently leaving out the growth part of the story.

The most recent update to forward EPS projections is now at 225 EPS for 2023 ([https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf](https://www.yardeni.com/pub/yriearningsforecast.pdf)).

That means that at S&amp;P 4000, we'd be trading at a 18 forward P/E. The historical average over the last 10 years is a 17x forward P/E, but this was with effectively 0% interest rates.

Growth is continuing to slow, and there's a real chance we'll see further earnings revisions to the downside.

In other words, the market is over valued because ""Santa rally"", or because the market would rather focus on inflation coming down instead of actual earnings growth and valuation multiples. I called out in a previous post that the market would rally into year end, and possibly into January, but it's likely a Bull trap as all we've really done over the last 2 months is multiple expansion, not real earnings growth.

What do you think is a fair multiple at 4%+ interest rates? I would argue 16x forward makes sense, so on 225 EPS that would make the fair value of the S&amp;P 3600 today. Obviously this isn't a perfect method of valuation and there are many other factors to consider, this is just a framework for how I think about a potential trading range we could see into next year.",finance,1670607521

personalfinance,Are high advertised rates on CDs usually teaser rates?,"Now that rates are going up I'm thinking of moving some of our savings into CDs but I don't want to spend a lot of time managing it.   I'm hoping to get a good rate and every time the CD matures, it renews at a good rate.

For instance I bank at Chase and I notice they have a [12 month CD at 3%](https://www.chase.com/personal/savings/bank-cd#rates) which is fine, but maturities like their 6 month and 18 month are 0.05% which doesn't make total sense to me.  How likely is it that next year the 12 month is 0.05% and the 18 month is 3%?

And then there's the higher rates advertised on [bankrate.com](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/best-1-year-cd-rates/).  Will I need to babysit those CDs and change banks every year to get the 4.7% they are advertising?

I know we can't predict future interest rates overall.  My question is about specific banks and their specific products.  In other words are the CDs with the best rates likely to continue to be good rates into the future?",finance,1670613350

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 12th, 2022.

# **Dow tumbles 300 points Friday, posts worst week since September - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks finished lower Friday, with all the major averages posting losses for the week as worries persisted over continued rate hikes.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 305.02 points, or 0.9%, to close at 33,476.46. The S&amp;P 500 tumbled 0.73% to end at 3,934.38, while the Nasdaq Composite fell 0.7% to finish at 11,004.62.
*****
&gt; On a weekly basis, the Dow fell 2.77% to post its worst week since September. The S&amp;P tumbled 3.37%, while the Nasdaq dropped 3.99%.
*****
&gt; Friday’s moves came after November’s producer price index showed higher-than-expected wholesale prices, which rose 0.3% last month and 7.4% over the previous year. Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, also topped expectations.
*****
&gt; Optimistic consumer sentiment data alleviated some fears, but attention remains laser-focused on next week’s busy economic calendar.
*****
&gt; Attention shifted toward the consumer price index due out Tuesday, which is expected to show whether inflation has receded. The Federal Reserve will likely deliver a 50 basis point hike at the end of its December meeting on Wednesday. While the increase would be smaller than the previous four hikes, concerns have mounted over whether the central bank can architect a soft landing and prevent a recession.
*****
&gt; Investors have long hoped for a pivot from the Fed’s aggressive tightening stance, but the data fails to support that desire, said Stephanie Lang, chief investment officer at Homrich Berg.
*****
&gt; “It’s our expectation that we really need to see inflation come down closer to the fed funds rate for the Fed to pause, and we still have quite a bit of delta between those numbers,” she said. “There’s still a bit of work to be done on the inflation front to really see that as the reality.”

&gt; In other news, shares of Lululemon tumbled nearly 13% after the company gave a weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter outlook. DocuSign jumped on strong results.

&gt; # Quarterly Options Expiration Historically Bullish

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/30804cd4212fb2f406ef46e31ae8248c/63e5a913c7477243-9f/s500x750/a5723d5045a0683344447e2721fb5996ef625828.jpg))**

&gt; In fact, the week of options expiration and the week after have the most bullish record of all quarterly option expirations (page 108, Stock Trader’s Almanac 2022 &amp; 2023 Almanac). Since 1982, DJIA has advanced 30 times during December’s options expiration week with an average gain of 0.51%. S&amp;P 500 has a similar, although slightly softer record.

&gt; However, the record is not pristine. Last year, accelerating inflation metrics triggered concerns the Fed was behind the curve with monetary policy. In 2018, DJIA and S&amp;P 500 suffered their worst weekly loss as the Fed remained hawkish and determined to raise interest rates even as economic growth was slowing and Treasury bond yields were falling. In 2011, Europe’s debt crisis derailed the market. In 2012, the threat of going over the fiscal cliff triggered a nearly 2% loss the week after.

&gt; Going into next week, the market’s bullish historical trends will be tested by the Fed and CPI. The Fed is widely anticipated to raise its rate by 0.5% to a new range of 4.25%-4.50%. Today’s slightly hotter than expected PPI raises the stakes slightly, but the trend of lower inflation does remain intact which suggests the Fed is likely to remain on the course.

&gt; # More Positive Signs for Inflation

&gt; There are many reasons stocks and bonds have had a rough year so far in 2022, and right at the top is the huge spike in inflation this year. With the latest ‘most important economic event of our lifetime’, aka the latest CPI data coming out on Tuesday, today we’ll look at some continued better inflation trends we are seeing.

&gt; First up, the consumer price index was up more than 9% year-over-year in June but has since come back to 7.7%, and we expect the trend to continue lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-141-800x546.png))**

&gt; Prices paid for manufacturing have simply crashed lower. If people aren’t paying as much for stuff, there is a good chance they will be able to charge less. As the chart below shows, services prices have been more stubborn, but manufacturing is dropping at a record pace. It recently came in at 43, cut in half from March.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-2100-800x546.png))**

&gt; Shelter makes up about 40% of the core inflation basket, so this is a very big deal when it runs hot as it has for most of this year, but should it turn lower, it could be a nice tailwind. Although the government’s data showed that rental prices were recently up more than 7% over the past year, we are seeing private measures of rents slowing down considerably, with the Apartment List nation rent report down a record 1% last month, on the heels of the previous record of 0.8% set the month before.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-334.png))**

&gt; Apartment List found that rents were up 17.6% last year but are up only 4.7% this year, and the trend remains firmly lower.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-4.png))**

&gt; Lastly, rents in 93 cities out of the 100 largest saw rents decline last month, so safe to say this is a widespread trend.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-5.png))**

&gt; Once again, government data lags behind private data, and the truth is that the government looks at existing and new leases, while private indices consider just new ones. Also, for the official data, rental units are sampled only every six months (given that rents aren’t re-negotiated very often). For this reason, we expect CPI rental measurements to lag private indices by about 8-12 months.

&gt; Additionally, Case-Shiller U.S. National Home Price Index has dropped more than 1% back-to-back months for the first time in over a decade and has been lower three months in a row. Again, positive signs show that inflation is coming back to earth.

&gt; Lastly, used car prices continue to sink. According to their data, the Manheim Used Car Index showed that used car prices have dropped a record six months in a row and are down year-over-year 14.2%, the largest decline ever. Given that used cars make up about 5% of headline inflation, this is another potential tailwind as we head into 2023. And similar to rent prices, the government’s data tends to be slow to get with the picture, so we expect these lower used car prices to begin to get into the government’s data more over the coming months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-6-800x377.png))**

&gt; Why does all of this matter? As quickly as inflation soared, we think it could come back down in 2023, and things like rents, prices paid, and used cars are all suggesting that much lower prices could be coming soon. This, of course, would give the Fed room to take the foot off the pedal and likely end rate hikes early next year.

&gt; # Sentiment Staves Off Lower Readings

&gt; Sentiment tipped over before the S&amp;P 500's rough start to December. Without the market giving investors any more reason to take a bullish stance, the latest sentiment data from the AAII showed that once again less than a quarter of respondents reported as bullish. This week's reading was actually slightly higher rising 0.2 percentage points to 24.7%, a reading in the middle of this year's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-1.png))**

&gt; Although bullish sentiment was higher, bearish sentiment rose by more with the reading going from 40.4% to 41.8%. That is the highest level since November 10th. While bearish sentiment has remained in a relatively tight range just above 40% for the past four weeks, current readings are more muted than what had been observed throughout most of the past year when there have been plenty of readings above 50%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-2.png))**

&gt; Overall, sentiment continues to heavily favor bears with a 17.1 percentage point spread between bulls and bears. That extends the record streak of negative readings to 36 weeks.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120822-Sentiment-3.png))**

&gt; While the AAII survey was overall little changed, other sentiment readings were a bit mixed. The NAAIM Exposure index dropped to the lowest reading in a month. Conversely, the Investors Intelligence survey saw bulls surge to the highest level since late August combined with the lowest reading in the percentage of respondents expecting a correction since June. Aggregating all of these readings points to sentiment taking a bit more pessimistic of a stance this week than what has been observed over the past month.

&gt; # S&amp;P 500 (SPY) December Drop

&gt; The S&amp;P 500 (SPY) has struggled to pick a direction so far this morning but at least as of this writing, it is on pace to finish lower yet again. From a technical perspective, the index is at a cross roads having formed a wedge in the past couple of months. During the recent rally, SPY did manage to move back above its 200-DMA, but it couldn't quite get above the past year's downtrend line. After the streak of declines in the past week, it has returned to the bottom of the rough uptrend line that has been in place off the October lows.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-1.png))**

&gt; Again price action has been choppy so far today, and while further declines could result in a break down, it would also mark an impressive, but not exactly unheard of, streak of declines. As shown below, it would be the fifth daily decline in a row. From a historical perspective, that is not particularly rare with 65 other streaks of 5 days or more since SPY began trading. As recently as October and September, there were two streaks that even extended to 6 days long.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722-SPY-2.png))**

&gt; What is more rare is for these streaks to start at the beginning of a new month. In fact, this month's 3.5% drop to start December is on pace to be the 20th worst start of a month for the S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) since inception, and there have only been two other times in which all of the first five trading days of a month have seen declines: February 2002 and June 2011. As shown below, those streaks of declines actually came in what were the middle of periods of consolidation while the following few months went on to experience further downside. As for the actual size of the declines, both of those previous instances saw larger drops (roughly around 4.5%) than the 3.5% decline currently.

&gt; # Bonds Catch a Bid as Stocks Sink

&gt; US equity markets have gotten off to a very weak start to December with four consecutive declines to start the month (and futures on Wednesday pointing to a fifth straight day). As shown below, SPY and most other major US index ETFs are already down more than 3% MTD, with growth underperforming value by a bit. Energy (XLE) is down most of the US sector ETFs followed by Consumer Discretionary (XLY) and Financials (XLF). Utilities (XLU) is down the least so far in December at just -0.50%.

&gt; International equity markets have held up a little better than the US. The All-World ex-US ETF (CWI) and the Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) are both down just 1.2% MTD, and the All-World ex-US ETF is now outperforming SPY on a YTD basis because of the recent divergence.

&gt; For most of the year heading into December, we saw the bond market fall in tandem with stocks, but recently as stocks have dropped, bonds have caught a bid. As shown in the bottom right corner of our ETF matrix below, Treasury ETFs of all durations are up on the month, with the 20+ Year Treasury (TLT) up the most at 4.35%.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/120722etf.png))**

&gt; The chart below of the year-to-date percentage change (total return) of the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) and the 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TLT) is a great way to highlight how closely stocks and bonds have tracked each other this year. So far this month, QQQ is down 3.98%, while TLT is up 4.35%, but this performance divergence over the last four days hardly shows up yet on the chart.

&gt; # Back-to-Back Monthly Surge Consolidating Gains

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.stocktradersalmanac.com/UploadedImage/blog_20221207_SP_5per_streak_table.jpg))**

&gt; Chances are you have already heard about the S&amp;P 500 gaining more than 5% in October and November this year. We can confirm this feat is not all that common occurring only 11 times since 1950 including this year. The longest S&amp;P 500 streak of monthly gains in excess of 5% per month was in 1998 beginning in September with a 6.2% advance, followed by 8.0% in October, 5.9% in November and 5.6% in December for a total gain of 28.4% in four months. The most recent streak was respectable, up 13.79% in two months.

&gt; Based upon the Bull &amp; Bear Markets table on page 134 of the 2023 Stock Trader’s Almanac, all ten previous streaks occurred in bull markets. Streaks in 2020, 2009, 2002, 1998 and 1974 all occurred early in new bull markets. Performance after the previous 10 monthly streaks ended was broadly bullish, but choppy during the 1-month immediately following. The recent tough start of trading this month is consistent with the consolidation that followed past streaks and the more recent 21-year Seasonal Pattern for December.

&gt; Digging deeper into the data we have graphed the 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the previous 10 streaks in the following chart. A typical calendar month has 21 trading days on average. We elected to set our reference point at the day the monthly streak ended. The sizable gain in the 30 trading days before is clear. What also becomes more visible is the tendency for the S&amp;P 500 to pause and consolidate those gains in the 15-20 trading days after the streak’s end. Following this period, the S&amp;P 500 historically resumed its march higher and was always higher 1-year after the streak ended.ail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; # When does the Santa Claus Rally Start?

&gt; As we noted on the blog last week, December is historically a strong month for stocks, and we don’t expect 2022 to be any different. It is historically the third-best month for the S&amp;P 500 since 1950 (April and November are stronger) and third-best during a midterm year (with October and November better).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-1-copy-800x338.png))**

&gt; Here are some of the major takeaways from that blog:

&gt; * When stocks are down for the year heading into this month, December has been higher eight of the past nine times.

&gt; * Stocks have finished green in December for the past three years, the longest such streak since six in a row from 2008 to 2013.
Midterm years have been worse lately, down a record 9.1% last time (in 2018) but also down in 2014. At least we’ve never seen stocks down three Decembers in a row during midterm years.

&gt; * When stocks are up in both October and November (which could be the case this year as long as we don’t see a massive drop today), the S&amp;P 500 doesn’t do quite as well in December, up 0.75% on average compared with the average December return of 1.54%, suggesting the prior months could be taking some of December’s historical strength.

&gt; * Lastly, only once in history has December been the worst month of the year for the S&amp;P 500. That was in 2018 when the Fed hiked rates one more time, and it caused massive selling, but this month is usually quite calm, and big drops are rare.

&gt; Taking things a step further, though, when does Santa come to town? One of the most well-known investment axioms is the “Santa Claus Rally,” and most investors assume it just means that stocks do well all of December, but this isn’t the case. It turns out that most of the strength in December happens in the latter half of the month. It makes sense to me, given that this is when Santa comes.

Due to the very low interest rate of my saving account by BoA, I am planning to open a Discover saving account and transfer 50k there.

I checked the incoming/outgoing fee of both banks. However, for wire transfer, BoA is setting a limit of $1,000 (per 24 hours, sending) and $10,000 (per 24 hours, $50,000 monthly, receiving).

Is there ways to transfer 50k in one go, or 2-3 rounds span across 2-3 weeks? I just can't do it in 50 days.

Thanks for reading!

personalfinance,Student Loan Consolidation denied-Help?,"Hello,

I applied to get my student loans consolidated. My original student loans total to about $32,000 with an interest rate between 10-13%. These loans are private and through Sallie Mae.


I have a 765 credit score. I graduated college in May. I’ve worked in retail for 4.5 years-3.5 years full time and recently quit my job there to peruse a higher paying job in insurance.  I started there 3 months ago (September). I had no gap in my employment. 

I applied for a loan through RISLA for a 5 year loan of $32,000 with a rate of 5.9%.

I submitted my latest paystub as well as my W2 from previous year. 

I received an email stating to send my last paystub from my retail job to show no employee employment gap and to ensure I met their income threshold. I submitted the documents as requested.

Today I received an email stating that my loan was denied due to being “Unable to use previous income, not in the same career field.” 

Is this a real thing? I held my retail job for 4 years while in college-maintained a solid income-And now perusing a job in my field with higher pay- If I met the income threshold of “40k” as per their email-how is my previous income not valid? 

Could I contact the bank and try to reverse the denial? Is there anything I can do to save this loan application??",finance,1670636482
personalfinance,(US) Can my GF claim my income when applying for a credit line increase?,"Hey all, my GF just hit $9k in student loans (on the way down from $25k).  I've been helping her pay it down, on average a few hundred dollars per month, and she's putting almost all of what she makes (less gas money) into it (around $700 / month).  When she applied for the loans she had no credit at all, with her parents cosigning.  She ended up with a relatively high interest rate (just shy of 9% IIRC), and I mentioned using a balance transfer to pay less interest in the last year.  She has what I thought was a decent balance transfer offer through her Discover card (3% fee, 0% interest until sometime in 2024), but her credit limit is only around $5k.  On the screen to apply for a credit limit increase, it says ""If you are 21 or older, you may include another person's income that is available to you.""  Can  she include my income as part of her application?  We are concerned that she won't get approved on her own for an increase because she doesn't make much, around $12k a year as a part time cashier.  I am going to help her finish off the loan, but I don't know if ""income that is available to you"" only means for married couples.  We're both financially responsible, so I'm not at all concerned about her going and spending money on a bunch of other things.  I am concerned with paying a bunch more in interest if she says with the high interest rate.

Said company is wanting to transition me to a new subcontractor. The new subcontractor informed me that I would be on a 1099 and are offering 30% increased compensation roughly.

personalfinance,Problems with Etrade,"When I go to the Etrade website on my Linux PC with Firefox, the display has problems, which started recently.  When I view my portfolio, it no longer shows the names of the stocks, but just their prices etc.

Also, the stock prices themselves are not always reliable.  Around 420 PM eastern time today, I recorded the prices from the display.  Then, around 8 PM, I went back there and found some of them different.  Those are the closing prices for the day, but some of them somehow got changed between 420 and 8 PM.  Then, around 9 PM, I looked again, and they were back to their 420 PM prices.

I'm thinking about switching brokers, because the Etrade problems might get worse, and might cause losses or something.  What online stockbroker is most recommended?

One thing I like about Etrade is that I can move money between stocks and savings with a 3.25% interest rate.  Another thing I like is that I can set a four hour timeout, so it will keep me logged in as long as I do something every four hours.

personalfinance,Would I benefit from a cash out refinance to help with debt consolidation?,"First, thanks for reading and for your information and input. I'm trying to become more financially literate; my parents had no clue what they were doing and so neither have I for a long time. So I really appreciate anyone taking the time to help me better understand my financial stuff.

My partner and I own our home, with a mortgage balance around 72k and 4.5 rate. Our home is worth about 128k. We have a lot of debt - not so much the amount but it's spread out a lot, and so I'm making several payments every month to a bunch of different lenders.

I think refinancing for a 100k loan, and using the cash out to pay off our debt, would be a good option for us, but basically I'm scared to screw up something that affects all my wealth. I was hoping someone would look over my math here and maybe point out any things I'm missing that would make this a bad idea for us.

We make about $4500/month between the 2 of us. We live within our budget but never have savings for big expenses like car repairs, vet bills, medical debt, etc. so we have a significant amount of credit card debt. I have health issues and want to start working part-time, which would reduce our monthly income to about 3500.

Our current expenses monthly (conservative estimates):

mortgage payment: 670 / balance 72k / rate 4.5%

credit card payments: 600 / balance: 12k / rates varied; most around 20%

utilities &amp; insurance: 700

student loan: 300 / balance 5k / rate 10%

car payment: 200 / balance 3k / rate 6%

health-related costs: 300

pets: 200

total: 3000

which leaves us with about 1500 for our groceries, gas, house supplies, etc. If I work part time, we have only 500 a month. If we keep it this way, we're on track to be debt-free by 2040ish, but I think being caught in the cycle of no savings/credit debt would probably prolong that.

If we refinance for 100k, with interest rates at around 6%, our monthly payment would be around what we're currently paying, 700ish. With the cash out, we'd pay off the credit cards and the loans, leaving us with a nice emergency savings cushion of 7k (although I'd probably dip into that to get our electricity updated so my partner can finally have the home office/gaming set up they deserve, so let's say 5k).

Our then monthly expenses would look like this:

I'm 50 years old and in great health.   I am planning the next 15 to 17 years of my working life in order to have a retirement where I have an income stream that doesn't dip into my 401k too much.

I'm a network engineer for a global company and make around 130K a year.   For most of my life I haven't been the best with money.   I should have WAY more money than I do now but we can't cry over spilt milk.

I have about 360K in my 401k.  I currently invest @ a lower rate due to the fact that I'm still trying to get rid of all CC debt.    I invest 15% of my salary now to 401k and Roth IRA.    I have 10k cash in savings, and I recently downsized to a Condo that I paid 230K for.   I owe about 175k on the mortgage after closing etc.

My CC's should be paid off by January or February at the latest.   My current plan is the following:

Get credit cards all paid off, that will cost me 6k.

I have a car note of 20k for a 2020 vehicle [Hyundai Santa Fe] with 40k miles.

Once I have my CC debt eliminated, I'm going to beef up my cash savings and contribute another 10% to my 401k to max it out.
I want to buy another condo near me at some point so that I have the condo I live in now....and then another one to rent out.   When would YOU pull the trigger to buy the 'investment' condo?

How much liquid cash should I have?   What interest rate should I care about?   I would be looking at spending around 225k or so for this other condo plus about 300 to 500 in condo fees etc.  

How would you plan this out?  How much cash would you want to have, I'm assuming 25% down like I did with the condo I'm in now.    What things would you  want in order before you pull the trigger?   

My ultimate goals is to build wealth even when I'm old, not use up what I have.  When I'm gone, my kids will reap the rest of what I've sown.   I'm working with them [adult kids now] on doing the same so that we have something to build from in the future.

personalfinance,Over a decade of work lost over an ignorant investment decision. Need your help.,"Context: My dad came to the US (Texas) for college in the early 80s. He completed his undergrad and found my mom while studying for his masters and later phd in engineering. While completing his masters he was paid about $1000 a month for research, and could take care of his wife and two kids. He would write down every little purchase on a notebook and keep track of it. He literally never spent money on himself but covered the needs of our family and put into charity when he had too much. His behavior was the same when he started working corporate. Given his profession and the frugal lifestyle, he never thought about what his money was doing; we were always content with what we had and I am blessed for that.


&amp;nbsp;


Two years ago he started thinking of retirement and I looked over his finances. For the past 10+ years he was contributing to his 401k, all to the same mutual income fund with a high expense ratio. This was not ideal and I shared with him some other options. I'm not advanced in financial matters but I repeated three simple principles. 1) It is dangerous to keep all your wealth in one asset. Diversify. 2) If you do move(buy/sell) any assets do it slowly, never all at once. 3) Timing the market is basically impossible, reaching out and hiring a financial advisor is probably the smartest strategy.


&amp;nbsp;


DISCLAIMER. The following is hard to read.

What he did:

He rolled over his 401k (&gt;90% of his wealth) to his IRA so he can control the account.
He then pulled out 100% from the mutual fund and used 70% of it to purchase QQQ, and 30% to purchase Apple (AAPL). In early December 2021. His reasoning was that it is one hundred different companies (the best ones).

Obviously the past year has been rough on the family. He hasn't moved it since except sell almost all of aapl to purchase a house (our only house, the first house our family has ever owned) in full.


&amp;nbsp;


So I need advice on two parts.

1) After losing so much of the initial investment (~25-30% unrealized currently), what's the strategy? Do I do what should have been done in the first place and diversify the portfolio leaning towards safe as he's retired, or stay in growth to try and recoup?

2) Taxes. After putting how much he withdrew this year(for the house) in a calculator it looks like we owe over 200k in federal tax, is that accurate? We've never owed even close to that and he has not had income for a year so this would have to come from selling way too much QQQ. What can we do to ease the bill? I read about tax harvesting but that only covers $3000 a year? Wouldn't do much in this situation.

I know this all sounds like the worst case scenario. I do not know how it happened to us. Any advice would be appreciated.",finance,1670696479

personalfinance,How do I maximize my salary in order to pay off loans and prepare for retirement?,"I'm 32. I went to med school in the US. Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that went straight through schooling and didn't pick up the most real life financial skills. My dad taught me the value of money from a young age. Luckily, I never developed bad spending habits or vices because of that. I'll go out for a meal here or there and I enjoy traveling, but even then I'm saving a few hundred-1000 a month. Overall, I'm fairly low maintenance.

Come next year I have my attending job which will have around $300k salary pay + call pay. The state I live in has no state income tax. This is more money than I know what to do with. I have friends that finished college and went straight into work and talk about retirement and this plan and that plan, and backdoor Roth etc. and truthfully most of that went over my head. I am reading up on all of this stuff, but my goals for myself are:

1. Pay of $195000 student loans at 6.8% interest rate (still federal). I know about the Public service loan forgiveness, and my work currently qualifies for it, but I think i've maybe only made \~4-5y worth of payment and stopped last july when the 0% interest kept on kicking things down the road because my loan servicer won't let me specifically pay the principal amount. Also, this job is a stepping stone for me, and I am not sure if I will be able to qualify at my new employment in the future. Plus, I haven't heard too many success stories about PSLF/am not sure it will be around when I apply in 5 years, but I'm skeptical by nature.
2. Buy a house. I don't want something massive, but I want a decent house one day. I want to save money for a downpayment so that I have options in the future and won't settle on something that's meh, and also have money saved for remodeling/surprise expenses after I buy it.
3. Save for retirement. My work offers a pension plan where I can contribute 8% of my salary and my employer matches 8% of my salary. 5 years vesting, and when I start next year, I will have 4 years left to vest into it.

Now I don't know how to prioritize these. When I budget next year, I will assume that my income will be my salary alone and call pay is just gravy that I shouldn't expect in terms of budgeting. Looking at my student loan repayment situation, I'll have to pay roughly $2300/mo for 10 years to pay off my loans if I keep my current servicer. I almost want to refinance, but I am waiting for the 10k forgiveness thing to pan out. And if I refinance to drop my rate, then the PSLF is gone. Part of me wants to spend \~6k a month and use some of my call pay to just knock it down and get rid of it in 2-3 years because I am relatively debt averse and don't want to pay interest, but that comes at the expense of saving for a house/other flex spending things.

My work will take 8% pretax for the pension plan, and then they offer a 403b and 457 which I'm wanting to maximize as well. I had some friends say don't worry about the 403b and 457 and just attack the 6.8% loan, but I don't know where to even start when it comes to understanding what to do with this money. Advice?

personalfinance,Avalanche Method vs. PSLF,"What is generally the sub’s approach to PSLF vs. Step 3? 

I feel like I’m comfortably tackling every step in the prime directive except #3. 

Context: 
My income: $90k 
Student debt: $8,700 @ 6.6%

My job paid $10k toward my student loans in 2022 (bringing it down to the current $8,700) and will do so again in 2023. At the moment I’m taking advantage of the payments pause and just letting my employer pay my loans off. Correct approach I assume? 

Spouse’s income: $75k
Spouse’s student debt: $210k @ 6.0% (law)

My spouse qualifies for PSLF (so do I but mine will be paid off before the 10 years so my question is more about how we’re handling my spouse’s debt). 

Instead of aggressively paying down my partner’s loans, we are simply making minimum payments and expecting PSLF to take care of the rest. Spouse is 2 years in (yes - correct payment plan/job/certifying every year). 

I have a federal job and contribute the max to TSP plus will have federal law enforcement retirement. Spouse also has a govt pension plan and contributes max to a 401(k). We have our short-ish goals savings in a CD account. Appropriate emergency funds in a regular savings account. Budget religiously. 

Back to the main question: since we’re comfortable, do we need to be more aggressive with student loans or are we doing the right thing by planning on PSLF? 

Yes, a lawyer could be making more, but PSLF is very attractive with that amount of debt and public service legal jobs which qualify don’t tend to pay the corporate law-style salaries.

*preface note:* ***I preemptively presume the smart answer to my question is, at my income, do both***\*--which is my aim, but I'm thinking conservatively about what I can throw toward retirement next year with some unfortunately large expenses I need to take care of in the next few months, so if I\* *HAD* *to choose one--so kindly avoid comments, such as ""you should be able to do both"" ""why cant you do both""--again, I am optimistic that I can, and will likely increase my contribution to 401k by year end*

So for year 2022, I will gross about 205,000, with a federal taxable gross of 181,000. I have been maxing out my Roth IRA for the past 2 years, and contribute around 8% to my 401K--which projecting for 2023 will mean I  contribute around 16k to my 401k (this includes a bonus i will get where 8% of that will also get pulled).

**My understanding is the 2023 IRS limit for 401k is 22.5k, which will mean, with my above projection** *(i have job stability \[as far as reasonably can presume, healthcare industry\] and the income/bonus is predictable)* **I would have about 6.5k to go to max out my 401k for 2023, which coincidentally is the limit for 2023 Roth IRA** (correct me in i am wrong, please)

**SO, the question is, IF i had an extra 6.5k to throw at retirement, would it make sense to go to max my IRA for 2023, or my 401k for 2023?** My bonus comes in the next few months so I would likely put the initial 6.5k toward whichever answer makes sense, and then of course work toward maxing out BOTH by end of year..

**EDIT**: **Follow up question**, if the answer is 401k, and i max out my 401k, what's the next account that would make sense for me throw more retirement money? Would it still be my roth IRA? And when i surpass limit then Backdoor?

Basically, the only reason the town I'd be living in exists is because of the base and the base is in the middle of nowhere. There's also rumors the base could be downsizing in the coming years. Anyway, I should be getting about $1250 for my housing allowance which with current interest rates could get me a house around $210,000 with a 20% down payment (which I wouldn't need to do with a VA loan, but definitely could afford). However, my assignment there would last only 4 or 5 years. Looking through some calculators and assuming the housing market here doesn't drastically go up, that would net me about $9k in equity by the time I'd look to sell. So good people of r/personalfinance, do you think it'd be worth it to buy a house with only that much gain in equity with the possibility that the value of the house could decrease due to base downsizing, or would renting be the better option?

personalfinance,Help with Debt vs. Investment Priorities,"Hello community of financial wizardom, I have a question that I think I understand but it is certainly worth asking for some clarification. 

In the past I've been told to consider interest rates carefully when choosing whether to pay down debt or just invest the money you'd otherwise have used to pay the debt. Typically, what I've been told is if the interest rate on the debt is greater than the typical return/interest rate on your investment then you should aggressively pay down the debt, and vice versa as the gains are really the difference between the gains and losses of the investment and interest accrual respectively. So in the case of a 15% credit card vs. a brokerage averaging 5-6% you'd hit the credit card with all your might, and on the flip side a mortgage at 2.875% vs. a 5-6% return investment you pay the mortgage slow and steady and you earn on the investment. In both those cases you come out ahead over time (assuming the time horizons for both situations are the same or close enough where you can allow the investment to grow aggressively). 

Now where I start to wonder, and it might be more simple than I'm making it in my head, is when you start to consider things like 401k/403b, IRA, HSA, etc. where there is tax protection in addition to the investment value over time. So to illustrate my present situation my wife and I had to use a HELOC to re-side our house as the siding was rotten and likely going to make more expensive problems over time if not addressed relatively soon. Now with the current economy the interest rates on the HELOC have jumped up substantially, by no means world shattering for us, but 7% is an uncomfortable number. What we're considering is reducing our retirement account contributions to try and pay the HELOC down more aggressively now that the interest rates have made the pay off that much harder. However, I am wondering in the long run would we save more by leaving our contributions the same and just paying it down at a consistent but not aggressive pace and with both the ROI on the account and the tax benefits make more over time? or will we save more aggressively decreasing the debt and then adjusting the contributions back when interest rates cool off (if we're still paying at that point). 

Some details, my wife is contributing 10% and I'm contributing 6% (plus I have a pension from public education that is baked into my salary), we're considering bumping it down to 6 and 4 respectively which will allow us to throw an extra several hundred at the principal each month. We're trying to iron out our financial plans going forward and this was one of the questions neither of us had a solid answer to due to the complexities of taxes and flux of investment accounts over time (we both use a spread of Vanguard funds that diversify both in the US and across the world and emerging markets). 

We bought the home because the guts were good and the shell needed some love, so we've got a few more projects in the future we'd like to get to relatively soon. However, nobody expects things like COVID and odd spikes in interest rates so any help/direction you all can offer us to help us choose the most efficient and financially responsible path here would be fantastic and greatly appreciated.",finance,1670728334

Not all countries are eligible, the US notably is not if I recall correctly.

developer,"Hello everyone, this is my first post here. Advice needed - I'm in a pickle.","I have spent the last two years living in Thailand running a web3 gaming guild. Pickings were initially rich with us earning 5 figures in one month. However, since then things have gone to shit. I now earn nothing and have had to return to the UK to seek treatment for cancer. My rental property has had a flood and the buildings insurance had a £10k excess due to my management company not being able to properly insure a flat adequately in the wake of the Grenfell crisis.

Interest rates have risen and my outgoings are now over £2500 a month in mortgage repayments before I have even woken up. (Up from £900) and I have no rental income. 

As you can imagine I am not in the greatest place mentally - but I'm a survivor. I want to dig my way out of the hole that i find myself in. The cancer treatment seems to have gone well and the works on the house are almost finished. Soon I will be able to put it on the market and hopefully all will be fine. 

However, in the meantime I am really struggling to make ends meet. i'm a full stack developer who specializes in PHP. JavaScript and React. I have found one contract since I have been home that has just about enabled me to keep my head above water. This contract will soon end. Every day I apply for new jobs online. Due to my circumstances and the fact I'm currently staying with my mother I need to find work that I can do remotely. I'm currently residing in Norfolk in the middle of nowhere with my mother. 

I have no portfolio as such to show due to my prolonged absence and am failing to get to the interview stage with any jobs. I am also a proficient graphic designer - an expert at Photoshop, illustrator etc.   


Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions as to how I can find some half decent paid work? Im willing to work for minimum wage to get to where I need to be (Normally I would charge £25 to £50 per hour). I just need a break and they seem to be hard to come by at the moment.

personalfinance,Are Treasury bills a good short-term investment?,"I'm a college student and I have around US$10,000 in a Capital One Performance Savings account paying 3% APY, and I'm wondering if I could do better than that. Right now my income from work just about covers my expenses and then a bit more. I plan on keeping a few thousand dollars on-hand just in case something comes up.

It's not viable for me to pay off loans at the moment because I would just have to borrow them again next year at a higher interest rate. I have $7,500 in student loan debt at 4% interest, but if I paid it off I would have to re-borrow next year at 6% interest. I think it is smarter to invest what I have and not borrow any more next year.

Edit to clarify: I owe $7,500 at 4% interest. If I paid it off, next year I would have to borrow another $7,500 at potentially higher (6%) interest. If I don't pay it off yet, I can use the money I have now to pay for my education expenses next year and borrow nothing.

I'm thinking of buying some Treasury bills, but I have no idea how they work. I bought $100 off TreasuryDirect but I'm a bit confused. To my knowledge, Treasury bills are sold at below face value and then they redeem for face value upon maturity. I entered $100 for the amount on TreasuryDirect for a 17-week Treasury bill, bought it earlier today, and it seems I will be issued a $100 face value bill and charged $100 for it, resulting in a 0% return. That doesn't sound right, but am I missing something?

Is there a better way to invest the money that I have now? I really don't want to commit to a 12-month I bond even though a 7% return does sound quite nice.

CryptoCurrency,Personal view of seeing another bullrun after Bitcoin halving in 2024,"I wanted to write down my prediction underlined with pro arguments that would make another bullrun likely for Bitcoin (altcoins excluded) if someone is interested. I want my prediction to be discussed here and want to state upfront that I am invested in Bitcoin and Ethereum since about 2017.  What did I miss out. What can be considered as wrong/misperception?  


&amp;#x200B;

\- Global recession looming right now. Historically the average recession has lasted 17 months ([https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/basics/crashes/how-long-do-recessions-last/](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/basics/crashes/how-long-do-recessions-last/)). High inflation and high interest rates would peak before halving estimated in March, 2024. Historically other bullruns gained pace around half a year after the halving event. FED is trying to do a soft landing in their interest rate policy. If it succeeds the timing in context of the halving could be in favor of a bullrun. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Corporate started to adapt Ethereum, naming NFTs in their accounting which is ongoing in 2021/2022. It will mature over the next years and keep gaining market share from Bitcoin. I likely see Bitcoin as a currency reserve for Ethereum which will be less volatile and more predictable in its price action. It still requires speculators to be flushed out. But with more use cases you will get less speculation. 

[Bitcoin Dominance Chart: https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/charts\/](https://preview.redd.it/ee1l2mlj495a1.png?width=1325&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=88b1ddffd49a2d26de092afb8d6d1cf88fb79dbd)

&amp;#x200B;

\- Bitcoin as one of the major POW (Proof of Work) protocols left will stay in its unique position. Computing power turned into encrypted currency (or digital gold) will have value on its own. Heavy encrypting costs money and Bitcoin holds that. My opinion gets underlined by recent investments e.g. from Apple to encrypt their cloud computing services. Encrypted data is valuable. So is encrypted currency (or digital gold). Other POWs will have to compete against the argument of energy waste more than Bitcoin because of their lack of decentralization, adaption and therefore security. I can imagine that high security protocols will be built on decentralized Bitcoin hashing power.

\- Google Trends does allow a historical view on Bitcoins/Ethereums search queries. While ""Bitcoin"" search queries peaked already in 2017 its valuation (ATH) has only peaked in 2021. That means that the USD price of Bitcoin was higher even when less people searched for it. My assumption here is that corporate has paved the way for the 2021/2022 bullrun and invested into it. Google was maybe not the platform of choice to research about Bitcoin for private investors anymore. Other platforms were involved to inform about it. Also it could be that ""old"" investors that already knew about Bitcoin were responsible for the price action on the last bullrun who likely won't do search queries on Bitcoin on Google. I'd takeaway here that Cryptocurrency has reached mainstream by now. My point about corporate adoption of Ethereum underlines that perspective. The next bullrun will be channeled by corporate advertising budgets with a promise of added value (e.g. digital gold praised by bank institutions, NFTs by corporate or social platforms).

personalfinance,Foreign Income and Tax vs US Capital Gains,"Suppose I am 100% expat living outside USA. Filing jointly with my spouse, we are able to exclude all our foreign income. We also have long term capital gains on US stocks, US accounts, all pre-dating our move. (I know the foreign country is interested in these too, but that's not the question, please.) 

I know the foreign tax credit does not help me with my US capital gains because I used the exclusion so can't use the credit (and I could not use that credit against US income anyway). But then there is the foreign tax *deduction*. Does that reduce my US capital gains income (for US income tax)? 

I'm using TurboTax, and it is making me nervous. If I tell it to use the standard deduction, which is less, I see that my tax owed increases (as an experiment). So the foreign income tax has an effect on the numbers (assuming it really should be allowed). But TurboTax does not identify my long terms capital gains as such on the summary page. It just reports ""Your Total Income"" and ""Federal Deductions"" and ""Your Taxable Income"". Ie, it all looks like ordinary income. 

I wish TurboTax would say Your capital gain rate is X because your income is Y. Is my income $0 if it's all excluded, so I get optimal long term treatment? I just can't figure the tax rates and the deduction effects to verify it. Maybe if I print it. (But then can I redo it after printing if I want to revise?) 

Or try TaxAct? Sorry if this question is a mess. I hate this mess. I may have to go back to paper, by hand.

edit: I definitely entered the capital gain as Long Term with Basis Reported. So I guess TT must be doing it right. I just wish it would show me more info to vet the results with. And I guess I should identify the main important question as: Is foreign income tax deductible from US capital gains (with the foreign tax credit not in play at all)?",finance,1670761388

[https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20140216/](https://coinmarketcap.com/historical/20140216/)

&amp;#x200B;

This is the first time that CoinMarketCap tracked over 100 coins. In this case it is technically 108 coins.

The previous available snapshot is on February 9, 2014 featuring 92 coins.

&amp;#x200B;

The Question are:

How many of these first original coins to be tracked are still alive today?

How many of them were meme coins and what is their aliveness status?

How many of them where animal themed and what is their aliveness status?

&amp;#x200B;

There are 2 categories for Aliveness:

Actually Alive: Meaning that the coin is actively tracked on CMC with at least some sort of regular social activity on any of the usual channels.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;

&amp;#x200B;

Technically Alive: Meaning that the coin is tracked on CMC, so it is technically trade-able, however, there has been no social activity detected in many months.

&amp;#x200B;

A coin is dead if there is no tracking on CoinMarketCap and no social activity detected in many months.

&amp;#x200B;

Findings:

An impressive 38/ 108 are either technically or actually alive. That’s a 35% survival rate.

&amp;#x200B;

Actually alive: 26 (24%)

Technically alive: 12 (11%)

&amp;#x200B;

Furthermore: of the top 10, the top 8 where actually alive and the bottom 2 where technically alive.

&amp;#x200B;

Memes:

I recognized 4 of the 108 coins as meme themed (numbered as rank by marketcap at time of snapshot)

&amp;#x200B;

5 – Dogecoin – actually alive

35- Fedora – actually alive

59 – Nyancoin – actually alive

87 – RonPaulCoin ( I think this is considered a meme) – dead :(

&amp;#x200B;

There is a 75% actual survival of these original meme coins vs. 21% survival of none meme coins (26 -3)/108

&amp;#x200B;

Animal based:

I recognized 4 of the 108 coins as animals (numbered as rank by marketcap at time of snapshot)

&amp;#x200B;

5 – Dogecoin – actually alive

31 – Kittencoin – dead

59- Nyancoin – actually alive

70 – Catcoin – dead (there are newer tokens of the same name)

There is a 50% actual survival of these original animal coins vs. 21% survival of none meme coins (26 -3)/108

personalfinance,Help me understand savings account interest rate. should I switch banks for higher interest ?,"I currently bank with a local Credit Union and have $60,000 saved, when checking my account I noticed that I've been receiving $7 in "" dividends ""  monthly for a while. I would imagine this is the interest rate you receive based on your savings amount. I've looked online at other banks and some have as high as 4% APY regarding saving interest. 

So if I switch to that bank, I would earn $2,400 a year on 60k, or am I doing the math wrong ? If so, that is a drastic difference from earning $7 a month and I would contemplate switching to a bank with a higher rate. I do like my bank for other reasons though ( lower loan rates, long grace periods, no fees,  etc ). Can someone tell me if that's a good idea ?

https://www.wsj.com/articles/fed-rate-increases-are-squeezing-consumer-finance-companies-11670712247?mod=hp_lead_pos3

Consumer spending in the U.S. is going strong. Consumer lending, not so much.

The financial squeeze that started about six months ago for companies that lend to ordinary Americans is getting worse, contrasting sharply with recent rallies in stocks and corporate bonds. The main reason: ***These finance companies have lost access to easy money.***

Widespread economic uncertainty has made debt investors less willing to buy the bonds these nontraditional lenders issue. Higher interest rates, courtesy of the Federal Reserve, have given investors other attractive options.

Now, ***these finance companies are paying as much as four times what they paid in January to borrow in bond markets the cash they lend to customers.*** Plenty of them are struggling to make that math work. Once-highflying consumer-finance companies such as Pagaya Technologies have flipped from profit to loss. Some smaller outfits are shutting down altogether.

***Many of the nontraditional lenders launched within the past decade, which means they have never weathered a sustained period of high interest rates.***

***“All of these fintech firms talk about their data science and machine learning capabilities, but the truth is, their models have not been battle tested through a recession yet,”*** said Reggie Smith, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s lead fintech stock analyst.

Pagaya and other startups such as Affirm Holdings Inc. and Carvana Co. aren’t banks, which means they can’t take deposits for funding. For borrowers with imperfect credit, these alternative lenders are sometimes the only way to get an auto loan, mortgage or buy-now-pay-later offer.

The companies are now lending less or charging more for loans they do make, adding to concerns already swirling about the health of the economy.

Athas Capital Group, an alternative mortgage lender in Calabasas Hills, Calif., announced its closure in November, citing the poor outlook for selling its loans to Wall Street firms.

“Do I set a bunch of cash on fire to stick around or do I close shop?” asked Brian O’Shaughnessy, co-chief executive officer. “We chose, right or wrong, to close up shop.”

He is now trying to help his roughly 265 employees find jobs at competing firms.

The average price of bonds backed by private-label mortgages recently fell to about 82 cents on the dollar, their lowest level since at least 2011, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Bond prices typically fall when interest rates rise and investors demand higher yields to lend money.

Sales of the bonds made from private-label mortgages, which don’t benefit from federal guarantees, boomed last year when Treasury bonds were paying peanuts.

Normally, loans from alternative lenders are bundled into securities that Wall Street firms sell to pension funds, insurers and other investors. These bonds are known as asset-backed securities, or ABS, and they are typically sold to investors in multiple slices that have different yields based on their risk.

The securitization process is integral to keeping many consumer-finance companies in business, but it can amplify market gyrations in unexpected ways. Prices of collateralized loan obligations, or CLOs—a type of ABS—gapped below fair value in October when U.K. insurers and pensions responded to rising interest rates by dumping CLO bonds.

Some investors have stopped buying ABS, which they still associate with the 2008 financial crisis, to reduce risk. Others are selling out of fear that the loans backing the bonds might go bad. Home prices are already falling in many U.S. cities, and delinquencies are creeping up on auto and other consumer loans.

The biggest change, though, is that insurance companies and pension funds have scaled back their interest in ABS, said Rich Barnett, a partner at investing firm Castlelake LP. Rising interest rates have lifted the yields on corporate bonds and Treasury bonds, making them attractive for the first time in years.

Prudential Financial Inc. has slowed once-brisk purchases of ABS and CLOs in its approximately $400 billion insurance account. Instead, it is snapping up high-rated corporate bonds because their yields have risen, socking them away in preparation for when the Fed starts cutting rates again, chief investment officer Timothy Schmidt said.

Investment-grade corporate bond yields doubled this year to a 13-year high of about 5%, which is close to the roughly 7% return many pensions and insurers shoot for. Another benefit: Corporate bonds have longer terms than most ABS, making them better matches to offset the payout schedules of insurance and pension liabilities.

“We will look back at the assets we’re buying now as pretty attractive,” Mr. Schmidt said. “I don’t think anyone expected rates to move this far this quickly.”

Investors still willing to buy the bonds are making borrowers pay up. Affirm, a buy-now-pay-later company, abandoned plans to issue a $350 million bond in November when investors demanded higher yields than it was willing to pay, people familiar with the matter said. The company also finances loans through bank credit lines and direct sales to investors such as the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board.

***Pagaya, a technology-driven consumer finance company, went ahead with a $543 million bond last month but had to pay investors an 8.1% interest rate on its best-quality bonds to get the deal done, according to data from Finsight. That marks a steep increase from the 6.1% rate it got on comparable bonds sold in August and 2% on a deal in January.***

Issuance of consumer-loan ABS declined slightly this year, but Pagaya has nearly doubled bond sales to about $3 billion, according to Finsight. Fees from bond sales account for much of the company’s revenue, according to its financial filings.

At the same time, delinquencies have risen on loans bundled into ABS that Pagaya sold. A bond the company issued in January at 100 cents on the dollar traded in mid-November at around 88 cents, according to data from Empirasign.

Pagaya has been buying loans with tighter underwriting standards this year, and its November bond issuance shows that bond investors trust the company’s artificial-intelligence methodology, its 34-year-old co-founder Gal Krubiner said. The U.S. and Israeli firm uses AI to identify attractive loans that other lenders would turn down, Mr. Krubiner said.

“We saw the uncertainty and volatility coming,” he added.

Pagaya’s stock is trading below $1, down from about $10 three months ago.

***Carvana, an online auto dealer, is facing a cash crunch. Its shares, which soared in the pandemic, have lost 98% of their value this year.*** The company recently hired restructuring advisers.

Asset-backed bonds of companies that go bankrupt typically avoid default, but their prices can fluctuate wildly. A bond backed by auto loans that Carvana issued for 100 cents on the dollar in September 2021 traded around 75 this month, according to data from Empirasign. Part of that decline also reflects the rise in overall interest rates.

For the shrinking pool of investors in the market, the yields have rarely been higher.

Subprime auto lender Flagship Credit Acceptance LLC did a roughly $400 million bond deal in late October. The riskiest chunk of its bonds, which had a double-B rating from some agencies, had a spread of 9 percentage points over going rates.

***No comparable subprime auto bond had ever priced with such a wide spread since at least the last financial crisis, according to John Kerschner, U.S. head of securitized products at Janus Henderson Investors. Investors who bought the debt received a yield of over 13%, according to Finsight.***

“It very much feels like you’re getting paid for the risk right now—and then some, quite frankly,” said Mr. Kerschner, who has been investing broadly in ABS.

personalfinance,I want to use a 0% interest balance-transfer CC to knock out other CC debt while aggressively paying down student loan debt,"Hey good people-

I currently have about $20k in credit card debt and an additional $40k remaining student loan debt. I had to do what was needed to get where I am now in life, which required debt at times. Now that I have two steady jobs that pay well and I can sustain, I’d like to focus on debt reduction with aggressive repayment of my student loans, while not incurring interest from the CC’s. 

I appreciate the snowball method and know to always pay highest interest rate first, but for existential sanity I need to see the SL balances drop. 

My plan is to use a zero percent balance transfer card for the CC debt and make straight-line monthly payments ($20k total with 20-month 0% for monthly payments of ~$1k) while using the bulk of my disposable income to knock down the SL balances. 

I know there will be a nominal balance transfer fee (quoted at 3%), but are there other conditions to worry about? 

I’m not concerned with having the cash to pay the balance down before the intro-period runs it’s course, I know to avoid that outcome. 

Given the context shared- am I making a good choice or should I go another route?

Edit- The SL debt wouldn’t work for a refinance, as the debt is old and subsidized so no rate would be to my benefit. Thanks

2nd Edit- It was always $20 CC debt, I waffled on what I would include in the scenario.

We are almost done building a home, we started building before the interest rates went crazy and had no idea they’d go up so quickly. But we did lock in a rate for 5.5%.

The mortgage will be $600,000. We will be at 80% LTV to avoid PMI. Home value is $775,000.

The only other debt we have is a rental property. I owe $200k on it and it grosses $3750 per month in rent. After mortgage, taxes, insurance, the net income is $1750.

I have $300,000 in total cash, I want to keep $100k as my emergency fund.

Option 1: put the $200k toward the house, borrowing $400k. Monthly mortgage payment on the house would be $3407 (no escrow).

Option 2: payoff the rental property, take the full $600k on the home and then the net income from the rental property completely pays the mortgage.

CryptoCurrency,Rob Kiyosaki’s Bitcoin Message to Millennials Has a Greater Impact on You Than His Book-Jayden Levitt,"**Before you take his advice, you must understand who he is.**

You may have noticed an uncomfortable amount of videos popping up on your Youtube and Facebook channels with [Robert Kiyosaki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki#cite_note-Road_To_Rich_Dad_CBC-2).

That’s because the business education mogul is now getting vocal about popular cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

When you watch one Kiyosaki video, the YouTube algorithm floodgates open to countless more, and there’s no going back.

Kiyosaki is a no-nonsense businessman who wrote one of the best finance books in history.

[Rich Dad, Poor Dad](https://www.waterstones.com/book/rich-dad-poor-dad/robert-t-kiyosaki/9781612681122#:~:text=Today%20Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad,than%2040%20million%20copies%20worldwide.), was also one of the first personal finance books I read as a teenager. Whilst I felt there weren’t actionable steps in the book, it left an imprint on me.

The book discusses the difference between assets and liabilities and how poor people buy liabilities and rich people buy assets.

It’s easy to see why it was such a smash hit because it’s written in such a clear, jargon-free way.

The polarising distinction between rich and poor is a constant theme in Kiyosaki’s world-famous book, and now even more so in his Youtube videos; it’s as if the Rich and Poor are two different breeds of human beings.

Youtube publications have headlines like;

* [**Do this now, or continue to be poor forever**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KuRAzbsfaIM)**.**
* [**You’ll never be poor again | start doing this today**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1p2PbfNk0c)
* [**Rich vs Poor Mindset**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=az6NibAUf7Y)

These titles are catchy and prey on people who want to escape desperate situations and improve their lives.

And ultimately result in watching the video, which leads to product sales.

You can’t blame the guy for wanting more brand exposure; he is an astute marketer.

Kiyosaki hates the stock market and loathes the schooling system.

When asked why people were poor, he famously responded;

&gt;“PhD stands for Poor Helpless and Desperate.”  
“The riskiest thing you can do is go to school, learn from a fake teacher and put your money with a financial planner, work hard for a lot of fake money and pay a lot of taxes.”  
“The fakest teachers are financial planners who tell you to save money and invest in the stock market. Why would you save money when the government is printing money?”  
“You look at all the pensions, the teachers, firefighters and the guys with 401K’s; they’re all bankrupt because everyone’s stolen their money.”

That gives you the unfiltered businessman’s take on the stock market and paying taxes which seems to be a theme with the American mega-rich.

You could agree with the man’s views on saving money. The rest is reaching at best.

# Stock Market Data — Last 94 Years

The S&amp;P 500 is a market index of 500 leading publicly traded companies in the U.S., showing average yearly returns from 1928 to 2021 of [**11.82%**.](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/042415/what-average-annual-return-sp-500.asp)

If you had invested $10,000 in the S&amp;P 500 index in 1992 and reinvested dividends, you’d now have more than $170,000.

Recent market volatility has seen a decline. However, the index has proven to be a winner over the long term, somewhat contradicting Kiyosaki’s sweeping statement about the stock market.

# What’s Kiyosaki like as a businessman?

He’s a clever marketer whose leading tactic appears to play off fear.

The million-dollar question is, is he a good businessman, or was his money made selling this aspirational life to millennials which made him rich?

Kiyosaki’s first idea for a business came from surfing out on the beach of Hawaii, where he grew up. He realised surfers had difficulty with what to do with their wallets when surfing.

So in 1977, at 30, he started a company called [Rippers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Kiyosaki#cite_note-Youn,_Jacy-9) that produced the first Nylon and Velcro surfer wallet.

He experienced immediate success.

He would later come out and say this business made him a millionaire at age 30, a claim which is still unconfirmed.

Later, [Rippers would go bankrupt](https://thecollegeinvestor.com/4726/ultimate-hypocrite-robert-kiyosaki-companys-bankruptcy/) because Kiyosaki failed to acquire his wallet’s valid patents and trademarks.

After this business failed, he invested what money he had in Property and Small-cap stocks, accumulating a debt of over 1 Million dollars.

He then started a new company that made t-shirts and hats and licenced other products. That company went bankrupt in 1980 too.

You’ve got to hand it to him, not deterred by failure. In 1985, he launched an Education company that would teach Entrepreneurship and investing. However, at that point, it’s hard to see that he had the success behind him to push business education out to the masses.

He did; it was his first big winner, with the education company selling for an unknown amount in 1994.

His biggest win was yet to come.

He decided to self-publish the book Rich Dad, Poor Dad, which multiple publishers rejected.

The book began gaining traction thanks to his partnership with [Amway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amway), a multiple-level network marketing company.

In 2007, the UK halted all [Amway business operations](https://arrestyourdebt.com/amway-pyramid-scheme/) in the country, with regulators claiming that the Company, short for “American Way”, had exaggerated income claims and profited more from selling education material to distributors than from legitimate direct selling of products.

## Oprah

Kiyosaki then got a chance of a lifetime to appear on Oprah, which almost didn’t happen because they wanted him to disclose the identity of the Rich dad in his book.

Oprah’s episode sent Rich Dad, Poor Dad to the moon, with [32 million copies sold in 102 countries and 52 languages](http://a/).

It secured a spot on the New York Times best sellers list for over six years.

And still, no one knows the existence of the Rich dad.

# Here’s how he made his fortune

Surprisingly most of Kiyosaki’s fortune hasn’t come from book sales.

In 1997 Kiyosaki founded the companies [Cash Flow Technologies Inc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Dad) and [Rich Global LLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rich_Dad).

He used the book’s popularity as a [lead magnet](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lead-magnet.asp#:~:text=A%20lead%20magnet%20is%20a,magnets%20to%20create%20sales%20leads.) to his higher-price seminars; as it turns out, this is how he amassed most of his wealth.

A lead magnet is a marketing tactic to draw people into buying your product.

Initially, he did his workshops, charging $12k-$50K per head. He would later contractually agree with a company called [Learning Annex](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-files-bankruptcy/story?id=17463158#:~:text=Bill%20Zanker%2C%20the%20founder%20and,told%20the%20New%20York%20Post.) to promote his seminars.

Unsurprisingly Kiyosaki failed to pay [Learning Annex](https://abcnews.go.com/Business/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-files-bankruptcy/story?id=17463158#:~:text=Bill%20Zanker%2C%20the%20founder%20and,told%20the%20New%20York%20Post.) and created another deal behind closed doors with Whitney International while still in contract with Learning Annex.

Rich Global LLC would be Kiyosaki’s 3rd company out of 4 to go bankrupt after being ordered to pay $24 million to the Learning Annex and its founder, Bill Zanker.

Kiyosaki was ordered to pay $23,687,957.21 after a jury ruled that a share of his profits should’ve gone to the Learning Annex for using their platform for speaking engagements.

Including one notable gig in 2002 at Madison Square Garden.

It’s unclear if Bill Zanker was ever paid in full.

Zanker was quoted sometime after the trial:

&gt;“I took Kiyosaki’s brand and made it bigger.  
The deal was I would get a percentage, and he reneged. We had a signed letter of intent. The Learning Annex is the greatest promoter. We put his ‘Rich Dad’ brand on a stage.  
We truly prepared him for great fame and riches. But when it was time for him to pay up, he said ‘no.  
I won even more money than I asked for from the jury, and then he declared corporate bankruptcy.  
**Oprah** believed in him, but he didn’t keep his promise to us.”

# Kiyosaki now says we’re in for a bigger crash than 2008 — And you should buy Bitcoin.

While his track record is questionable, Kiyosaki’s ability to explain complex topics in an easy-to-learn way is unprecedented.

His perspectives on money and investing contradict conventional thoughts, and he’s gained a reputation as a straight talker and advocate for financial education.

Here’s what he recently came out and said on Twitter:

*SAVERS ARE LOSERS. 25 years ago, in RICH DAD POOR DAD I stated savers are losers. Today, US debt in 100s of trillions. REAL INFLATION is 16% not 7%. Fed raising interest rates will destroy US economy. Savers will be biggest losers. Invest in REAL MONEY. Gold, silver &amp; Bitcoin.  Sep 16 2022*

Despite being bullish on Bitcoin, he says Millennials fall under three categories regarding Cryptocurrency, and I believe he’s right.

The concept is featured in his book, but It’s had a more significant impact on me this time round.

Perhaps because it’s related to Cryptocurrency.

You’re either:

* **Investor**
* **Trader**
* **Speculator**

He highlights that there isn’t anything fundamentally wrong with each category and says traders are flippers who will make money until the market crashes.

Speculators are gamblers hoping and praying for the price to go up. When it goes down, they sell out of fear.

Investors buy more when the price goes down. In Kiyosaki’s most recent Tweet, he hit home on his thesis of being an Investor 

*BUYING OPPORTUNITY: if FED continues raising interest rates US $ will get stronger causing gold, silver &amp; Bitcoin prices to go lower. BUY more.  When FED pivots and drops interest rates as England just did you will smile while others cry. Take care  Oct 2, 2022*

Kiyosaki believes that most people chasing Cryptocurrency are speculators.

**He explains;**

&gt;*“Never be a speculator or trader; if you are investing in the market, always invest for the long term and have a long-term time horizon.*  
*So many of those young guys got rich off of bitcoin, but when the market adjusted, they got afraid. They were worried because they got rich being speculators; they got lucky and just happened to buy 10k bitcoin at a dollar each, and now they are multi-millionaires. The reason they are afraid is if bitcoin goes to zero, which it could, they’ll lose it all.”*  
*All you Bitcoin Millennials out there, this is what I do.*  
*I save Gold, Silver, Bitcoin, Ethereum and bullets.*

Kiyosaki is using fear. Again.

Who exactly are the bullets for?

Kiyosaki has contradicted himself by saying he’s now not buying Bitcoin for one perfect reason.

He’s waiting for it to crash.

# Finally

There is no doubt that Kiyosaki is a success through his education company and further investments.

His advice, however, needs to be looked at with a critical lens. Today, if a young entrepreneur gives business advice, it’s open to scrutiny.

Your immediate thoughts lead you to dissect the individual’s track record like you would when an athlete joins your favourite football team.

When he says our school system has failed us, I think he’s right; student debt is at crazy levels globally. Schools also don’t teach you money or financial literacy. They don’t teach you real-life things like how to manage your finances, but instead how to take instructions from others.

School is Priming you for the job market.

While we all probably have questionable elements in our backgrounds, Kiyosaki, Heralded as a visionary, has a gift for simplifying complex ideas related to money which has impacted millions of people.

This is something you can’t take away from him.

personalfinance,What to do with a car loan?,"Hi all, 

I am in a bit of a conundrum. I want to preface this with yes, I know I made some dumb decisions but want to move on from them and learn from them. 

In august, I traded in my car ($5k trade offer with $10k balance) for a new car with MSRP $33k. $2k down with a ~4.7% interest rate yields a payment of ~$800/month which I can afford. I no longer want this car, because the payment is annoying, and I no longer view cars as an hobby, but instead as a liability. I want to be able to get rid of all my tools and be happy with an ordinary used commuter car like an Accord or something along those lines. The car is worth $30k to a dealer and ~$33k private party and I owe $40k so I would have to make up the difference, which I do not have right now. With that said, what would be the best way to go around getting rid of this payment?",finance,1670810144

# CPI data tomorrow ( in ~29h ) 8:30am EST

CPI data release will 100% hit ON THE SECOND it's coming out the entire markets with heavy volatility. I know it sounds crazy but that's how huge the impact currently is. Here is some on chart data from the last release days:

**last release made BTC jump +5.87% in one hour saving us from potentially below $15,000**

A more estimated hike of 50 BPS could result into a more positive sentiment but it all depends on the further information released on the day. Again, expect high volatility.

**Rumors about a settlement between XRP &amp; SEC on the 15th December**

For those that missed the topic this court case has been going on sinc 2020.  The SEC filed a lawsuit against Ripple In December 2020, arguing that XRP was an unlicensed security. The outcome of this lawsuit could have a massive impact on crypto ( especially XRP obviously ) It's a lot to get into so I highly recommend checking out latest news if you are interested.

# TL;DR:

It is safe to say that this week will have a massive impact on crypto with multiple important economic data releases &amp; the XRP case. If you are actively trading I highly recommend to stay away from high leverage unless you really know what you are doing. The volatility is always liquidating positions left &amp; right. **Stop-Losses won't protect you on sudden spike &amp; plunges because they wil most likely not fill.**

The outcome of this week can easily push crypto back on track for an end of year rally towards $20,000 but also put a lot of selling pressure back towards $15,000 range. Even if the outcome balances out perfectly and results into a more neutral outcome it will still have huge volatility in both directions.

Bitcoin,What are the best resources for learning the arguments AGAINST Bitcoin?,"The more I read about the technology the more amazed I get. As much as I would love for BTC to hit $1 million and be able to buy myself a Lambo, my mindset is gradually changing more toward being equally as interested in how Bitcoin can make the world a better place and the little things I can do to help drive adoption (even if just paying for a coffee in BTC when the opportunity arises). Maybe I've had too much of whatever drug Saylor has had, but I feel like this is a once in millennia invention and our generation is the custodian of it. 

With that being said, I don't want to drown in too much hopium and want to understand the risks and the arguments against it. I'm not talking about 70-year-old Margaret on Facebook whose research has led to the conclusion that ""fake internet money is going to zero"" or Doug who has laugh-reacted to the last several hundred news stories about Bitcoin being dead. I mean some serious content comparable to Lyn Alden, Robert Breedlove, or Saifedean, but with the argument against it. I want to challenge my own beliefs and understand detractors' own arguments better than they do.

Now that I see how much I am paying in taxes per pay plus will still end up owing at the end of the year (even though I claim 0) got me thinking. I’ve used a few tax calculators and notice if I contribute 20k into my 401k I’ll end up only paying around 4k in federal taxes versus a little over 10k which I payed already this yr.

That extra 6k could be put into my 401k instead of just being payed as federal taxes correct? Plus that should lower my taxable income to possibly allow for a tax return at the end of next year?

The only reason I was doing 5% was to build up savings for a house + pay off my student debt but I’m not sure it’s worth it as I am taking heavy hit on taxes in the process.

# [Stock futures nudge higher to start the week with Fed meeting, key inflation data on deck](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/11/stock-market-news-futures-open-to-close-live-updates.html)
*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures were fractionally higher early Monday ahead of a week with several anticipated events in the ongoing fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 50 points, or 0.15%. Those for the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 edged 0.2% and 0.26% higher, respectively.
*****
&gt; The move in futures comes as investors will be focused on inflation this week. On Tuesday, the November consumer price index will be released, and traders will be looking for a sign that inflation is slowing.
*****
&gt; The Federal Reserve has a two-day meeting starting the same day. The central bank is expected to announce another rate hike on Wednesday, though traders are anticipating a smaller move than in recent months.
*****
&gt; In addition to the expected rate hike, the Fed’s updated economic projections and Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference could be key signals for what the central bank wants to do in the coming months.
*****
&gt; “Financial conditions have eased dramatically since the October CPI reading released last month, so the Fed will likely use the December FOMC meeting to walk those back,” said Cliff Hodge, chief investment officer for Cornerstone Wealth. “We think the markets are too sanguine on rates after the first quarter and we expect Powell to take a more hawkish tone and for the dots to indicate higher rates for a longer period of time than what is currently being priced in by the futures markets.”
*****
&gt; Wall Street is coming off a rocky week that saw all three major averages lose ground. The Dow fell 2.77% for its worst week since September. The S&amp;P 500 dropped 3.37%, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 3.99%.

personalfinance,Service that automatically reinvests in highest interest rate CD available?,"I've heard about a service that will automatically move your investment from one financial institution to another where the best interest rate is available based on the frequency you choose.  There is no need to track interest rates, establish new accounts at each institution, etc. Anyone know what it is called?

Example:  You invest $10,000 in 6 month CDs.  The service automatically chooses the bank with the highest interest rate, and then in 6 months, takes the proceeds and invests it again wherever the interest rate is highest then.  Rinse, and repeat.  They provide a 1099 INT that covers the entire fiscal year, regardless of the number of banks your money has been moved to.  You can change the frequency to take effect when your next CD maturity comes up.

I assume the service charges a small fee, but also makes money by being able to invest in CDs with that have higher rates for higher investment minimums.  Sort of like crowdfunding CDs that optimizes interest from data mining personal finance sites.",finance,1670857314
stocks,"Stock Market’s Defining Moment Arrives With CPI, Fed Decision","It’s the week everyone’s been waiting for. With the release a key measure of inflation, the Federal Reserve interest-rate decision and Chair Jerome Powell’s comments afterward, investors are hoping to finally have a clear view of what’s ahead for a beaten-down stock market and economy in 2023.

But after a tumultuous year that has the S&amp;P 500 Index looking at its biggest annual loss since 2008, equity traders are prepared for one sure thing over the coming sessions: more volatility.

Inflation reports have been rocking equities all year, leaving markets to gauge the central bank’s likely policy path amid relentlessly surging prices. This week’s consumer price index reading is crucial, as signs of ebbing inflation could buoy shares into year-end by tempering expectations for further Fed hikes.

Over the past six months, the S&amp;P 500 has seen an average move of about 3% in either direction on the day CPI has been released, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the highest since 2009. The S&amp;P 500 has fallen on seven of the 11 CPI reporting days this year.

The US central bank is widely expected to deliver a half-point hike at the close of its meeting on Dec. 14. So equity investors are more focused on what Powell has to say at his press conference afterward, looking for any hints on the path forward for interest rates. The Fed’s outlook for the US economy will also be a focus, along with any changes in central bankers’ rate projections.",finance,1670858750

We have channels for everyone from beginners to advanced analysts and traders, and tons of stickied reference materials and content.

*I'll post the entry level stuff below but its far from a comprehensive list:*

**Charting Tools**: sign up for Trading View. There are other charting tools out there and some look at different types of data, but your default toolset for crypto and other financial markets will be TV.

**On-Chain Data**: On-chain data can be used to paint a story. Some traders don't like on-chain data, but it can provide insight into specific activities in the market, like miners dumping, long/short ratios in the markets, whales stacking, etc. To use these you will probably need to spend time looking at FAQ and Googling questions as its a little more complex than reading a TradingView chart.

**A few final tips**: There are dozens of trading strategies out there, each with their own unique strength and weakness. Some are better suited to specific timeframes, others to different markets. Some aren't even listed here.

To be a successful investor or trader here are my top recommendations:

* Don't place anyone's opinion here over yours, teach and learn on your own. Think about formal coursework or study if you are really serious.
* Risk management is #1 always. Don't enter risky trades, don't risk too much on one trade. Use stoploss. And respect that trading and investing is never without risk.
* Consider the regulatory space on long term holds.
* Plan every trade and investment. Don't rush in. Don't revenge trade. Don't FOMO.
* Practice, practice. Paper trading is a great idea. Back-testing any strategy is also good.
* Invest in meaningful utility and trends. Like is the future multi-chain? Maybe cross-chain tech will be good. AI is exploding this year? Maybe look for projects that meaningfully integrate it.
* If you are a long term investor, take the time to understand monetary and financial cycles, study the history of crypto cycles and monitor regulatory climate for signs that you need to adjust your portfolio (enter/exits).
* This doesn't really address NFTs, but some of the same strategies that work here will work on NFTs. Supply, demand economics still apply.",cryptocurrency,1670859124
stocks,"‘There is a slowdown happening’ – Wells Fargo, BofA CEOs point to cooling consumer amid Fed hikes","American consumers are tapping the brakes on spending as the Federal Reserve's [interest rate increases](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/11/30/fed-chair-jerome-powell-says-smaller-rate-hikes-could-come-in-december.html) reverberate throughout the economy, according to the CEOs of two of the largest American banks.

After two years of pandemic-fueled, double-digit growth in [Bank of America](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/BAC/) card volume, ""the rate of growth is slowing,"" CEO [Brian Moynihan](https://www.cnbc.com/brian-moynihan/) said Tuesday at a financial conference. While retail payments surged 11% so far this year to nearly $4 trillion, that increase obscures a slowdown that began in recent weeks: November spending rose just 5%, he said.

It was a similar story at rival [Wells Fargo](https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC/), according to CEO [Charlie Scharf,](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/27/at-wells-fargo-a-jamie-dimon-protege-finally-takes-over-a-big-us-bank.html) who cited shrinking growth in credit-card spending and roughly flat debit card transaction volumes.

 The bank leaders, with their bird's eye view of the U.S. economy, are providing evidence that the Fed's campaign to subdue inflation by raising borrowing costs is beginning to impact consumer behavior. Fortified by pandemic stimulus checks, wage gains and low unemployment, American consumers have [supported the economy](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/17/bank-of-america-ceo-brian-moynihan-says-the-us-consumer-is-healthy.html), but that appears to be changing. That will have [implications](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/recession-walmart-jpmorgan-gm-ceos-talk-about-possible-slowdown.html) for corporate profits as businesses navigate 2023. 

 

""There is a slowdown happening, there's no question about it,"" Scharf said. ""We are expecting a fairly weak economy throughout the entire year, and hopeful that it'll be somewhat mild relative to what it could possibly be.""

Both CEOs said they expect a recession in 2023. Bank of America's Moynihan said he expects three quarters of negative growth next year followed by a slight uptick in the fourth quarter.

 

But, in a divergence that has implications for the coming months, the downturn isn't being felt equally across retail customers and businesses so far, according to the Wells Fargo CEO.

""We have seen certainly more stress on the lower-end consumer than on the upper end,"" Scharf said. In terms of the companies served by Wells Fargo, ""there are some that are doing quite well and there's some that are struggling.""

[Airlines](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/06/airlines-will-return-to-profitability-in-2023-after-three-year-slump-iata.html), cruise providers and other experience or entertainment-based industries are faring better than those involved in durable goods, he said. That sentiment was echoed by Moynihan, who cited strong travel spending.

""People bought a lot of goods, exercised a lot of the freedom they had in discretionary spend over the last couple of years, and those purchases are slowing,"" Scharf said. ""You're seeing significant shifts to things like travel and restaurants and entertainment and some of the things that people want to do.""

The slowdown is the ""intended outcome"" that's desired by the Fed as it seeks to tame inflation, Moynihan noted.

But the central bank has a tricky balancing act to pull off: raising rates enough to slow the economy, while hopefully avoiding a harsh downturn. Many market forecasters expect the Fed's benchmark rate to hit about 5% next year, though some think higher rates will be needed.

""You're starting to see that \[slowdown\] take hold,"" Moynihan said. ""The real question will be how soon they have to stabilize that in order to avoid more damage; that's the question that's on the table.""",finance,1670859620
CryptoCurrency,Are you gonna be hands-off or handhold when your children start investing in crypto?,"You have earned your stripes in the crypto space.

personalfinance,Consistent High Yield Savings,"~15 years ago I opened a high yield savings account at one of the banks near the top of the list for highest interest rate. Within 4 or 5 months the bank I chose was no longer near the top of the list. After less than a year it wasn't even in the top half. I think I switched banks once but the same thing happened again.

Now it's December, 2022 and I'm looking for a place to park my emergency fund where it will be secure but still keep up with inflation. An FDIC insured high yield savings account seems like a perfect choice. 

There are many lists online of the banks offering the highest rates. Apparently many lists are updated monthly, but I can't find a single one that includes data regarding the banks' rate histories. A list that shows each bank's current interest rate and also their average rate over the last 12-18 months would be ideal. 

Where can I find a list like that? 

 I don't wanna get suckered into the ""bait &amp; rate drop"" again.

Edit: To clarify, I'm not looking for a bank with the highest rate at any given time, I'm looking for one that's consistently near the top. Of course they all change, the question is how they change relative to each other. I want the bank I chose to at least ""make the list"" consistently over the long run. A bank offering 4% today is worthless if the rate falls below 2% in January while other banks stay above 3%.",finance,1670864394

An oil spill in a creek in northeastern Kansas this week is the largest for an onshore crude pipeline in more than nine years and by far the biggest in the history of the Keystone pipeline, according to federal data. 

Canada-based TC Energy on Thursday estimated the spill on the Keystone system at about 14,000 barrels and said the affected pipeline segment had been “isolated” and the oil contained at the site with booms, or barriers. It did not say how the spill occurred.  

After a drop in pressure on the pipeline that carries oil from Canada to the Texas Gulf Coast, the company said it shut down its Keystone system Wednesday night. Oil spilled into a creek in Washington County, Kansas, about 150 miles (240 kilometers) northwest of Kansas City.

personalfinance,"Buying a home: Should I put down as much as possible, or save a portion to have on the side?","My backstory:

I'm a single guy in my 20s who works a stable job making about $50k/year in America. I experienced a traumatic life event about five years ago, and after much legal battle, I'll be receiving a settlement that totals $250,000. I receive this in yearly payments of $60,000, I've already received payments for 2021 and 2022.

I want to use this money for a large down payment on a home. I moved to a new state recently, and the homes I'm interested in are asking between 325–375k—I'm not looking for anything extravagant, just a regular-sized home to call my own and live in. Not investing, not flipping, I just want to have a secure foundation and stop renting. I wouldn't otherwise be able to buy a home in my area, the mortgage payment would be too high with the down payment I could save naturally.

Next month I'll receive my third payment, and combined with the money I've saved this year, I'll have $200k ready to spend. I also have my ""life savings"" in a separate account that I'd accumulated before the settlement, which is about $28k. My current plan is to use the entire $200k on a down payment to mortgage about $150k, which in my area leaves me a total PITI payment of roughly $1,200/month. This is comfortable to me, as I'm already paying about $1,000 in rent and I always have money each month to put into savings or do fun things with (I currently have zero debt).

My hope is to live in this house long-term. When my fourth $60,000 payment comes in 2024, I'm planning to sit on that until interest rates fall, then refinance with more money down into a 15-year loan. This should get my monthly payment down to 3 digits on a much shorter timeline, which is very attractive to me.

My overall question is, does this sound like a good idea financially within the mindset of buying a home? Or should I keep some of the $200k on-hand to do other things with? Savings, investing, using towards my mortgage payments to cheapen them? Any and all advice would be appreciated, thank you.

TL:DR — I will have $200k for a down payment on a home, $28k in savings, $60k coming in 2024. Should I use all $200k or save some?",finance,1670871325

personalfinance,Wondering if it makes any sense to do a Roth conversion this year with stock values down?,"**Considering Retiring in next 2 years. Maybe at 55 that would not be considered R.E.? USA HCOL**

Current Income aprox $750K. As I understand I can convert some or all of traditional 401K to the Roth and this is taxed at my tax rate of aprox 37% (FED+State). Lets say I have $100K in TESLA and think this will be a 5X in three years...If move TSLA to Roth this year I pay $37K Tax this year for the conversion. By the time we reach 59 1/2 (7 years) we can take that out tax free. Hoping TSLA will be $500K by then we can withdraw that tax free in retirement.

On the other side...Should I wait 2 years until my income is reduced to only Int/Div income ($100K max) and then consider conversion while I am taxed less?

I was thinking it made sense to maybe convert up to $300k to a Roth this year and pay $120K tax to let it grow tax free. But then I said it might be best to wait 2 years until my income takes big dip.

  Quick Notes : -

\* There was about 30 Wikipedia tabs open (with some chill tracks playing in the back) while I narrowed it down to make sure I didn't miss anything so took me a couple of days, if you don't see (X) game means it's probably not my cuppa tea / didn't make the final list / never owned console or copy.

\* These are in no particular order, I only categorized by main genres (Platformers for example are under Action according to Wikipedia)…some games might fall under one or another genre so I just went for a broader approach, added (console tag) to specify which console I played it on or my preferred port.

\* This is NOT a list of what I think are the best 100 of all time, it's my personal favorites...which is (like most lists) subjective !

\* My only criteria for buying a game is fun / replay value, added a 3rd criteria for older / retro games just for the sake of this list which is ""ages well"" and/or ""still holds up""

personalfinance,Saving for a downpayment - how to factor interst rates in the future? am I missing anything important?,"Hey all,

I plan to buy a studio  as a home in NYC 5 years from now. 

A factor that is concerning me  is the interest rates. I am unsure if I will be comfrotable locking into an interest rate 5 years from now  for my current target price right now. That is the only thing i cannot predict. How do people usually overcome this barrier - a higher downpayment?

Here is how I'm budgetting:

\- Downpayment by accounting my area's appericaiton rate historically, let's say it's 3 percent  historically. So i adjust my downpayment by pretending that the house compounded   
 3% for 5 years from now.

\- I am adjusting 6% for closing cost to be conservative

personalfinance,"with the rent so high right now, is it better to rent a apartment or rent house? what are some pros cons?","I currently rent my uncle's condo, but now he wants to sell it. Since he is tired of paying yearly taxes and associates fees. I'm trying to look for apartments in my area but they're so high and sometimes looking on craigslist some houses for rent are so cheap but I feel like they're sketchy or scam. So I don't really trust those websites. I tried looking into low income housing but it's such a long waiting list. And even if lucky I find, it's probably in a bad neighborhood. Every apartment ask for 3x monthly rent income and previous pay stubs. I don't even make enough money and my mom barely makes anything since her health isn't in good condition. 

I guess the housing market is considered the seller market? Maybe even if my uncle's intention is to get the profit from selling, he won't gain much since the interest rate are high. Unless someone wants to buy for cash. The condo I'm living in right now has a lot of problems and we don't have a good realtionship anymore with him. He is causing too much problems since he doesn't want to fix anything. As a owner, it's his responsibility to fix stuff. But we pay for everything. My mom health isn't in good condition and it's like what am I suppose to do now. I'm so tired mentally. I can't even focus on my college right now.

CryptoCurrency,"Binance might be prosecuted. “But what about SBF”, you ask?","Before you downvote me: yes, I know: not another SBF post. But you all brought it on yourselves this time. Today we saw the same headline posted here 4-5 times, including from Reuters so it’s quite reliable: The US justice department is hesitating about pressing charges against Binance on their investigation about money laundering started in 2018.

What does it has to do with SBF you ask? Well absolutely nothing, and yet most top comments on those articles were about…you’ve guessed: SBF.    
These comments were mostly asking why they weren’t charging SBF instead and things like that.

But the answer is in the first paragraph. The investigation started in 2018, it took four years for the prosecutors to gather evidence and now they’re considering pressing charges.     
Again with a similar recent example, from the start of the Theranos scandal to E. Holmes conviction, seven years had passed. 

I know that you have the counter argument of Bernie Madoff who was arrested within days, but it was after his sons called the authorities through their lawyers etc so the Feds had a basis to arrest him straight away with those testimonies. Caroline Ellison was in NYC recently so she might be talking though, who knows. They would  also need the Bahamian authorities to cooperate and arrest and extradite him too so it’s not as easy as raiding Madoff’s home. 

I already know that some people will only read the title, and maybe the first and last paragraph, and comment straightaway “that’s because he donated to politicians”, so let’s address that. I still don’t think it’ll matter much because we discovered that he secretly donated to both parties significantly. So there’s no reason for politicians to influence the DOJ if he’s actually not helping them specifically. Also he doesn’t have any money to give anymore so he won’t be useful for them on the future.

So that’s it really, we need to be patient if we want SBF to face the justice system, because we don’t want him to get off easy on some technicality. It might take months or years if nobody is willing to cooperate fully, but it should happen eventually.


TLDR: the investigation on Binance took four years. Things like that take time and it’s only been a month since the FTX collapse.

stocks,Top short picks after CPI ?,"Alright folks.  Lets talk.

Tomorrow is a big day and we shall see what happens with CPI.  Fed not so much because they are just going to come out and do 50, but they will still move the market.

If CPI is good and soft number than we shall rally for a bit till JP comes out and smashes those hopes.  But we could rally through the end of the year if the CPI is softer than expected.

But what if CPI meets expectation or is hotter than expected.  The market is going to sell of and then will start a dump to 3600 again and if that happens potentially down to 3200 after the earnings season.

But in short term, if the CPI number is hot tomorrow, how to play the market.  What are the stocks to short ?  Some might say that the time to make that trade was today and not tomorrow.  I guess you might be right.  But lets say that for folks who didnt do that, what are their best options tomorrow after a hot CPI report.

I have never really shorted the market.  Mostly whenever I feel bearish, I have just bought puts or sold calls.  But never short shares.

Is this area beween 32-35 a buy for ARKK if you are already in the stock.  If you are already own ARKK and bought it in tripple digits (ouch), is this the time to avg down.  I understand that avg down shouldnt be just to avg down a holding if its a bad stock.  One should look at the new money as separate investment and see if it makes sense to invest in the stock at these levels.  Yes.

investing,Should we include settlement lag in calculating Treasury Bill interest rate?,"I've been buying new auction T-Bills recently and I noticed one issue that may make them look more attractive than they really are. This is less of an issue for T-Bills with longer maturities like 6 or 12 months, but for the shorter ones like 4 weeks it may be especially noticeable.

The issue is the lag between the auction date and the settlement date. Let's take the most recent 4 week T-Bill auction as an example. The lag between the auction date and the settlement date is 5 days (I'm using calendar days instead of business days, for reasons that will become obvious later). The maturity of the T-Bill is 28 days, which does not include the 5 day lag. The auction price was $99.7161. To calculate the yield we just apply the formula:

(100 - 99.7161) / 99.7161 \* (365 / 28) = 3.711%

Which matches what the Treasury website shows as the investment yield for that auction. However, note that the use of the 28 days in the formula. One problem with this calculation is that our money, when participating in this auction, is not merely tied up for 28 days. The money is deducted on the auction date and released on the maturity date. So in reality the money is tied up for 33 days. So in reality, based on when our money is actually going into this investment, the rate should be calculated as follows:

(100 - 99.7161) / 99.7161 \* (365 / 33) = 3.149%

This is a quite a bit lower than what the rate looks like when you ignore the settlement lag! Of course for longer durations this is less of an issue, it is especially acute when buying the 4 week T-Bill.

Has anybody else given this some thought? I wonder if it makes more sense to always take into account the settlement lag when calculating T-Bill yields to make sure comparisons to other assets are fair.",finance,1670893040

I had just moved cities for a new, better paying job, still had some stimulus money, etc. For further context I don’t have much guidance on personal finance other than my sister who is only a few years older than me. Again, not an excuse, just painting a picture. 

The issue was that the rent for the apartment I moved in to for my new job was not quite in my budget as I thought it was. In a few months’ time after opening my 2nd card, I was hardcore struggling to pay rent in full on time and was even using my credit cards to make the last bit of payment some months (I know now that that was a VERY bad decision, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20). During this time my student loans fell behind too. Luckily I have recently managed to save those from being reported as delinquent (unless I am somehow missing something again, which would be my luck). 

Naturally my credit cards pretty quickly maxed out and with my high rent and other living expenses, I fell behind on my credit card payments. I didn’t really have a set schedule on paying them before, just put it random amounts above the minimum payment here and there, which again was not good decision making.

Here’s where the ignorance really sets in: I genuinely did not know that delinquencies were a thing. Had never even heard the word in a credit context until Sallie Mae threatened to report some of my loans as delinquent (hence why I quickly got those in order). I moved to a MUCH cheaper place about 5 months ago and have been slowly getting back on my feet financially, starting with the student loans. I knew my credit cards were maxed out but just figured my credit score would just…go down, and then go back up once I started paying them off consecutively (I know, it sounds SO dumb). 

My sister had told me about how she had consolidated her credit card debt into one monthly payment at a low-ish interest rate. Sounded great to me, 1 monthly payment to really get my debt under control, because it was certainly on my mind. I could see by now that my credit score had gotten to the 570s so I specifically looked for a lender that specialized in low credit and wouldn’t do a hard hit to my score. I immediately got denied, which surprised me, and I was even more surprised to learn the reason being that I had delinquencies listed on my credit report! I was so confused, because my student loan situation was mostly handled at this point. 

So I did some googling and learned that I can go look at my entire credit report for free. I was amazed. That tells you more about how ignorant I am about all of this. I am certainly learning the hard way. I went and got my credit report and learned that both my credit cards were (obviously) both in delinquent status. Which I had learned during my research lasts up to 7 years on a report. Cue panic because I was truly oblivious to this.

Just another quick disclaimer here that I fully acknowledge that I caused this problem for myself. Not looking for any sympathy, just some advice (once I finish this explanation). 

So I’m now, obviously, getting my shit together and making payments on these cards. Because I still am paying rent (albeit much lower, thank god), my car loan (which is thankfully in good shape), car insurance, and just finished getting my student loans current, I’m living paycheck to paycheck and struggling with groceries and all of that - all this to say, I’m not quite there making good monthly payments just yet. But I’m getting there. I’ve got stuff scheduled. This was a rather recent discovery.

I believe the Capital One card was 30+ days late, and the Bank of America over 90 if not more. Yep, I know, it’s bad. The debt is a little over $8k total. 

Now that I’ve kind of explained how I got here, here’s my questions based on the research I’ve done on delinquencies:

1. So it’ll fall off my report after 7 years. This obviously freaks me out because I’m only 26 - does this mean I won’t be able to get approved for an apartment somewhere else? Will I be SOL if my car gets totaled and I need to finance a new one? Is my life essentially fucked financially for the next 7 years? This is obviously the part I’m most worried about.
2. I’ve seen in a few places online that the longer time passes where you’re making payments on the delinquent accounts, the less “negatively” the delinquency will affect your credit score. True or false? And even if my credit score gets better again in less than 7 years, am I still going to be denied for things like apartments, car loans, etc. because the delinquencies will still be on there? Or does it all just depend on the potential lender/property?
3. I’ve seen that one thing I can do is dispute the late payments. I don’t see the point in that for my situation. The late payments are valid. I guess there’s a chance the dispute wouldn’t be responded to which if my research is correct would mean I would win the dispute? Is it worth considering?
4. The other thing I see that I can do is write a goodwill letter to both creditors once I have been making consecutive monthly payments for awhile. I was feeling optimistic about this but while looking through this subreddit it seems that this is not very likely of working out in my favor. My questions on this are: How long should I wait (while making consistent monthly payments) before writing a goodwill letter? Months, years? Or does my balance need to be completely wiped before a creditor would even consider taking the delinquency off my report? Is there some kind of template for writing a goodwill letter? Would I basically just explain that I completely messed up due to ignorance or is that laughable? Will I need to list every single missed payment? 
5. Are there any specific debt-paying methods I should try in this particular situation, with consolidation being off the table (for now, I hope)?

If you’ve read this far, thank you. Before responding just know that I’ve already beaten myself up a lot about getting myself into this place. Right now I’m just looking for some concise advice/answers to my questions so I can actually set a concrete plan in motion instead of just panicking. And not get into this situation again. Like I said above, this is definitely a lesson I’ve learned the hard way.",finance,1670893292
personalfinance,What extra costs should I be aware of buying a NEW car vs a pre-owned one?,"Hello Friends of Reddit PF!

For background, I have never bought a brand new car, and generally prefer to buy late model pre-owned with low miles, but for the model I'm looking at new cars are equal or lesser cost than the used right now.

I also usually run my cars into the ground before replacing, but my 9 year old Kia is starting to have some engine issues and I think it would be smarter to replace is now while it still has some trade-in value and before interest rates go up again (still wish I could have held onto it for a few more years though).

I'm looking at a model that starts at 23/24K before taxes, fees, etc. Other than taxes, what other unexpected fees/charges should I be prepared for that would raise that cost for new cars? Should I be counting on an extra few hundred, few thousand, etc? I'll be getting FOTD cost estimates from dealers, but looking for a little pre-planning advice from experienced folks such as yourselves. Thanks, All!

Edit to clarify: I'm primarily interested in planning for any ""new car smell"" fees (made up example - I hope) that I should expect to get tacked on to the actual car purchase that would be different from what I'm used to buying used.

As you may have seen here in these forums lots of people get their crypto hacked and stolen from exchanges.

Those exchanges say that it is your problem, you signed up to arbitration and waived your right to sue them when they send your crypto off to thieves. 

If those companies have to pay back all the money that gets stolen from exchange users as the Electronic Funds Transfer Act requires, they will mostly be broke.

The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to hear an appeal by  Coinbase, which is seeking to have two customer lawsuits against the company resolved by private arbitration, not by a federal court.

personalfinance,Should I get a used vs new toyota corolla at this point in time?,"Hi yall! Hope you guys are well.

I am currently thinking of purchasing my first car ever by the end of this month but prices have been terrible to say the least. I am lucky enough to have my company's credit union offer me up to 40k USD auto loan pre approval at a 4.75% interest rate on a new car and 5.25% on a used car. Thus far I have been pretty deadset on getting a corolla just because of its reputation and reliability. My second option would be a civic (but its more expensive, so its most likely a no). 

The dealership I went to had the new 2022 models for corolla at about 28\~29k OTD. On the other hand, most used corollas (newer ones with low mileage) tend to range around the 17-21k pre tax. I was deadset on getting a used car to save money before but now I am not so sure anymore given that the price difference between the two isn't even that far off at this moment. I'd like some insight on what you guys will do if you were in my situation.

Context:

I am based in FL and make roughly around 69k base rate and can potentially earn about 10k-15k more (approx) yearly if i pick up extra shifts, but i def dont want to be picking up shifts for the sole purpose of paying off my car.

personalfinance,"Relatively high earner, struggling with financial advisors/life insurance/etc and being misled","I've made decent money for awhile, but mostly just contribute to maxing out 401k and adding to savings. Over the last few years things have gotten to where I need to find a better investment method.

38, married, 2 young kids. No debt. About $300k liquid, will be another $2-300k next year. Most of this is via K-1 through a business I own. About $500k in other assets. I max out 401k but need to do something with the additional taxable income. My business CPA is strongly suggesting a ""DB Cash Plan""

I have come into contact with a couple of personal financial advisors over the years. I STRONGLY feel like they basically recommend whatever is getting them the most commission. For example, everything I've researched points to the DB cash balance plan as a good way to carve out some taxable income. One of the PFA's scoffed at this, saying it's ultra complicated and ""too tied to the business"" and I instead should invest into IRAs with him. The other PFA scoffed at that, and is insisting I should be investing into ""Vanguard Funds"". Neither PFA can really give a simple reason why their method is ideal. Both will try to go off on tangents and I have to literally tell them, to tell me in two simple sentences why their method makes more sense. Neither can really do it.

Basically, I have a large amount of K-1 income that I pay massive amounts of tax on in order to turn it liquid. My kids are in elementary school, I've got about 10 years before college is going to come up. I have no significant debt.

This same thing is happening with life insurance. Whoever I talk to has some ""different"" plan that is far far better for me.",finance,1670933251

# [Stock futures rise as investors await key November inflation report](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/12/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose Tuesday as Wall Street braced for November’s key inflation report and the beginning of the Federal Reserve December policy meeting.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 197 points, or 0.57%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures added 0.53% and 0.55%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors are looking ahead to the release of November’s consumer price index report, and hoping for signs of easing inflation. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect a 0.3% increase on a monthly basis or an annual pace of 7.3%. That would be a step down from October’s 0.4% monthly increase and annual gain of 7.7%.
*****
&gt; Tuesday’s inflation report could play a key role in the Federal Reserve’s next rate-hiking decision expected at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday.
*****
&gt; Traders are largely pricing in a 50 basis point increase, a slight decline from the previous four hikes. They will also monitor updated economic projections and commentary out of Chair Jerome Powell’s press conference for signs of a potential policy pivot as fears of a recession linger on Wall Street.
*****
&gt; Monday’s overnight moves follow a solid session for all the major averages after a tough down week. The Dow gained more than 528 points, or 1.58%, while the S&amp;P and Nasdaq rose 1.43% and 1.26%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All S&amp;P 500 sectors finished with gains, led to the upside by energy stocks, which rose as oil prices gained.
*****
&gt; “I think this is a reflection of what’s anticipated out of the CPI number tomorrow, and a hope that the Fed will confirm a 50 basis point raise on Wednesday,” said Kevin Philip, partner at Bel Air Investment Advisors.
*****
&gt; “I think the market, as it’s done before, is banking, in my opinion, a little too heavily on some sort of Fed pivot and this bounce we got today is fragile at best.”

It takes 9-12 months for rate hikes to be felt and 12-18 months for the maximum effect. The CPI report, interest rate hikes, house prices and rents, wage growth, job openings, unemployment rate, international conflicts and trade wars all play a significant role in guiding the market's macroenvironment.

personalfinance,Parents (Ages 83 &amp; 84) are in a bind w/HELOC,"My parents took out a HELOC back in 2015 &amp; extended it in 2020.  They’re on a fixed income (~$3100/month).  House &amp; car are paid off.  I think they originally took out the HELOC for home improvements but as time has gone by, it seems that they’ve also used it to pay for property taxes and lord knows what else.  They don’t live a lavish lifestyle; they go out for breakfast (@cheap places $10-20 total) which is their only “luxury”.  

They’re now in a real bind due to the interest rate increase.  They owe ~$100k and have been paying only the interest.  Aside from being bailed out by me, what are their options for relieving the financial strain?  What would happen if they just stopped paying?

Edit:  Thanks to each and every one of you for your responses and advice!  

A few things that were consistently asked/ mentioned:

1) When my parents pass, the house will be sold.  I have zero interest in moving there (it’s a nice area, just don’t want to live there).  My sibling WILL NOT get the house.  I’m executor off their will and will do everything in my power to keep him out. 

2) Similar homes in their subdivision have sold for $250-$275k.  I don’t necessarily think that’s what theirs would sell for because who knows what the housing market will be like at that time.

3) They live in a low COL area.  Their property taxes are ~$3,500/year.

4) Aside from their astronomical cable/internet/landline (🙄) bill, my Mom estimates they spend ~$225/week on groceries.  It’s very possible that there was a miscommunication there, since she is very deaf and may not have heard the question correctly because **I** don’t even spend that much on groceries &amp; we’re big eaters.  

5) They’re on Medicare and a supplemental insurance plan.  They also have life insurance and long term disability insurance.  

6) Their breakfasts out are cheap - $10-20 for both of them (low COL area).

7) They bought a new heater and ac last Spring, new tires for the car, and pay the homeowners insurance with this HELOC money.

8) I’m almost certain they’re not helping out my sibling financially, BUT I’m going to ask them face to face because there were a lot of transactions on their statement (which I went through with them but only picked out the transactions of $500+) for between $200-$400.  I truly don’t think they’d lie to me about this, but if I find out they are I’ll be absolutely shattered.",finance,1670938447

personalfinance,I've been financially irresponsible with my credit card payments. Is there a good way to take advantage of it?,"My credit score has dropped to 600 and I owe about 10k in different credit cards, my end goal in the future is to have a really good credit score so eventually I can get a gold loan for a house or appartment.

I heard taking out a loan raises credit score and builds trust with lenders so I was wondering if it was a good idea to pay some of the credit cards, get a lower interest rate and then borrow the money?

I'm not an impulsive buyer btw or anything like that. I've just been taking a lot more responsability than I should be (I just finishedoff paying someone else's debt aswell as paying for that persons bill aswell as my own on time every single one) so now I've finally decided to start taking care of myself. So I should have little to no problems paying it off and not gathering more debt. I've also yet to pay any interests on any credit cards. The debt is fresh from this year.

A brief run down of my situation: I work at a local daycare in which my mom is a supervisor. She's the one who asked me to start working there since they were short-staffed so no I didn't beg my mom for a job. But in the months since, she's hired new, better teachers, and I'm not needed around as much.

Right now I work 12-5 mon-fri. I \*used\* to work 7-5 so yea it's quite the cut in pay. Well. I'm scheduled to work until 5 but I'm usually let out around 4:30 instead to help my siblings with after school activities. So while I should be working 25 hours it's more like 22-23. I make $12.50 an hour so most days I earn about $57\~. According to a salary calculator, with holiday/vacation time adjusted, I make 13.5k a year. Barely over 1k monthly. And I put half of all my paychecks into a savings account (I am trying to save to move out but after 3 months I barely have over a thousand dollars put away).

I don't have to pay rent or bills yet but I've been told that I will have to start paying soon. And I'm very nervous about it. I've asked for more hours and been denied. I know I should find a different job, and I'm considering it, but for now I'm stuck here. And I want to make the best of my current situation. I'm not well mentally and working with the kids here has been the one job I can stand. I just wish it payed better.

Forex,Huge opportunity to go long on USD and make huge money.,"Not only do I expect a reversal, going long on USD grants a nice amount of swap so basically, you're winning everyday.  

Short on XAG/USD at $23.900.  
Short on GBP/USD at 1.2435.  
Long USD/CHF at 0.9250.  
Long USD/JPY at 135.00.

There are quite a few reasons to be bullish on the USD if we take a fundamental approach.

1.  Inflation has come in lower, but it is still insane.  
2. Despite the other Fed officials singing in dovish tunes, Powell and Yellen both remains hawkish and they have the ability and courage to overwrite.
3. If recession is coming, flow of funds moves towards cash and safe havens-both benefitting the USD.  If recession is coming, precious metals are going to unwind big-time and the short on XAG/USD will be insane.  
4. If hikes are slowing down, guess what, so would the other central banks.  Once other central banks follow suit and announce that they will be slowing down too, the natural flow is back to USD.

Going big on these positions and am sure they will pay off huge in January.  Feel free to bookmark this and check back in January.

My wife and I have lived in our current house for about 2 years. I was lucky enough to buy the house when rock-bottom interest rates were still prevalent and before home prices quickly began to increase. There are a few things about the house we don't like such as: no closet in our bedroom, small concrete backyard although we have a large front yard with a deck, unfinished basement, minimal natural light in kitchen, no garage although we do have a very large driveway. We have looked into moving in a few years, but even at a decent interest rate, we would still be paying much more than we currently pay. And our current house also has plenty of space for us and is in a great area. Do you think these small inconveniences are worth looking into moving in the future?

I guess there's a potential 24 delay in accessing the funds since it has to transfer to a valid checking account, but is that really a concern for an emergency fund? 

Edit: I keep 1 months worth of expenses in my checking already, so this is in regards to the additional 2-4 months that is recommended.

Additionally these high yield savings accounts seem to have big disparities in interest rates. I'm seeing Bask at 4%, Capital One at 3%, Virtual Bank at 2.8%, Citizens st 3.75%, etc.

I compared them on bankrate.com, which was recommended to me, but I have no idea if it's actually a reliable site. What should I be looking for when I shop savings accounts?

I can't afford to do more otherwise I would but I would like put $100 for Birthdays and Christmases in an investment account.

My considerations are that it be impactful to her future (decent returns), cannot be withdrawn by her parents, and can be used for more than just a college education if she chooses. 

I am aware of 529s, but I usually see people recommend against them if college isn't the goal? Are the penalties really worse than the potential returns even if the child chooses not to use them for college? 

If I went with another account, like a UTMA are the returns worth it to avoid penalties with the 529? I guess worse case scenario here is she does go to college and the returns aren't what they could've been with a 529.

bonds,is my long term thesis wrong? please correct my misunderstanding of bonds.,"I know a decent amount about stocks, but my bond knowledge is lacking.  I am trying to fix this and read up, hopefully you can provide some insight to my thought process here and what I am not considering.  Or misunderstanding.

&amp;#x200B;

If my thesis is recession for the US economy in 2023,  I want to move sell some of my profitable equities from the last rally and move into bonds.  Call it 50% bonds and 50% equities. My thoughts are

\- short term downside in equities of potentially 15% in the next year or two if the SPY bottoms out around 3500 or even lower, depending on severity of recession.

\-If this happens and economic activity slows enough, or even layoffs, FED will stop raising rates.  It seems they are getting close to the top already regardless of the prospect of recession.

\-If inflation goes down drastically in a recession, lets say back to target of 2% ( a longshot i know but hear me out)  the fed might even be comfortable to start lowering rates again.

\-If this happens, would this not push the TLT higher as we reverse into lowering rates again.  The bottom looks like it might already be in the TLT a few months ago in anticipation of the tops of rate hikes?

\-Since I am still working and not close to retirement, as the TLT climbs I could gradually rebalance back into a lower SPY if it is at 3500 over the next year of 2.

What are my risks with this line of thinking?  

\-A semi soft landing happens, with persistent 5% inflation, so the fed does not lower, rather they hold rates and the days of free money are gone.  So the TLT likely trades sideways for several years.  But at least I get a small 2% yield correct?  I would take that over the 15% downside risk of my entire portfolio in equities?

or

\-we get extremely positive news and a soft landing inflation crashes and the war stops and unicorns come out to play and we get a rip roaring equities market to a new all time high of 5000 with a good jobs market.  This is unlikely in my opiniion, but if it did happen, I miss some of that equity rally (though I do capture some of it since I am 50/50%) however the bond market would likely suffer in this scenario?

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to correct my basic misunderstanding of how the bond market ""usually"" reacts.

personalfinance,Advice Needed - Down payment on home,"Looking for advice on down payment options for purchase of new home. 

Ideally I'll sell and get the money from closing on my current home prior to closing on buying of new house, but if that doesn't happen, I'm considering two options (if anyone knows of other options I am open to listening).

Option 1: Put 10% down. Take out HELOC and pay it off once I sell current home. I'm told the additional costs associated with setting up HELOC are ~2k. 

Option 2: Put 10% down and pay PMI(~$100/month) until hopefully I'm able to refinance in 1-2 years assuming rates drop enough to justify the refinance. 
It doesn't seem like putting a lump sum of cash towards the principle just to remove PMI will be a good option if I'm not also refinancing, but I could be wrong about this especially if interest rates don't drop in the next 1-2 years. 

It looks like Option 2 (paying PMI and refinancing) is the better of the two options as I'd likely pay less in PMI than costs associated with the HELOC, but please let me know if I'm overlooking anything. 

One other potential which would be within the Option 2 category: Make it an ARM in order to have a lower interest rate and refinance as planned in 1-2 years. Obviously the risk here is if interest rates don't drop. Also not sure if there's any penalty to refinance an ARM within less than 2 years.

If any more info is needed feel free to ask.

energy,Anyone know the implementation plan/status on the Inflation Reduction Act Heat Pump Rebates?,"I got a couple of estimates for a heat pump install and I'm ready to pull the trigger except for the uncertainty around the IRA rebates.  I was planning to check all the rules and wait until after Jan 1 to have the work done and then apply for the rebates manually (instead of getting the cash at install time).  Unfortunately, it looks like I'll need to wait a while to even know what the rules will be for the rebate program.  

I know the rough outline of the rules but apparently the point of sale rebates will be state implemented and aren't expected to come online until April or later.  That's fine, but I was hoping the rules would at least be clear, especially with respect to the rebates being retroactive to January 1 installs and to the min specs required.  But I can't find anything clarifying this (either at the state level or federal level).

I currently have 2 installers ready to go.  I'm fine paying the full price and waiting to get the rebate, but I need to know for sure what my net cost will be before I pull the trigger.

Assuming everyone in the market for a heat pump takes the same wait-and-see approach I'm taking, it seems installers could find themselves in a pretty serious slowdown for the next several months until later next year, when they'll probably be overwhelmed.

Does anyone know where I might find guidance on how all this is expected to play out over the next several months?",energy,1670964339
investing,Teva Pharmaceuticals update,"Dear fellow Redditors,

A year ago I posted ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/rhq6n2/teva_pharmaceuticals_due_diligence/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)) a DD on Teva pharmaceuticals and I wanted to provide a short yearly update as well as mention another company that is similarly positioned.

Teva (market cap of 10.07 B \[9.27 B last year\]) is currently still battling the quite damaging purchase of Allergan Generics in 2015 \[40.5 B\] which brought the company a lot of debt and lawsuits related to opioid sales, both of which Teva is now slowly digesting.

TEVA has a current debt of 21.3 B (in Q3/22: 18.5B long term, 2.8B short term \[23.7B in Q3/21\]). The company is not paying dividends and focusing on reducing debt to the tune of about 2B/year, which it was quite consistent in doing during Kare Schultz’s tenure as CEO. Kare will be handing over the reins to Richard Francis in 2023 (former head of Sandoz, the generic branch of Novartis). With opioid litigation seemingly settled and restructuring well underway, Richard is likely to have less headwind starting into the job.

The stock price jumped to a market cap of 12.45B in Aug22 after opioid settlement plans were disclosed, but has come back down since, likely due to concerns with rising interest rates and leadership handover. I sold half of my stocks in summer (could not resist the windfall) and have started buying again more recently. Overall I think Teva did a good job in correcting course and continues to be a solid long value investment.

If like me you have a penchant for blue-chip companies restructuring after disastrous acquisitions, Bayer (BAYRY) bears uncanny similarities to Teva. Bayer \[current Market Cap 54B\] overpaid for Monsanto in 2018 \[63 B\] and gained a string of lawsuits bolstered by bad press. Recently I was discussing with a lawyer specialized in mergers and acquisitions how embarassingly bad the DD must have been in both cases (or how well the involved consultants sold the deal). I’ve been following Bayer for some time and might post a more in depth look if anybody is interested.

Until then I wish you all a great holiday season and good luck with your investments!",finance,1670966523

investing,Latest in the FTX saga - The Parents in the Middle of FTX’s Collapse - NYT,"Not sure if this really conforms to the guidelines, but it is about an investment firm gone belly up and maybe is a cautionary tale. Anyway ...

That both Blankman-Fried's parents are Stanford University law professors has been a sorry part of this story, as had they known, they surely would have strenuously objected, right?. They weren't estranged, apparently, so it's too bad he didn't make them privy to his accounting books

But there is a $16.4 million house in the Bahamas in his parents' name, where they have stayed when they visit, that could become a big deal in this case for them. They all insist the house was intended to be a company property, not theirs and that they never thought of it as theirs. Yet, there it is, in their name. I'm sure that will get looked at.

His father visited the Bahamas at least monthly, according to reporting from the NYT. You have to wonder how this remained hidden.

And what about the CFO and the general counsel? His general counsel used to work with Gary Gensler and is no light weight. How could you not wonder about the books? Did he? Didn't he wonder where the money came from for Alameda? How can he be a general counsel at FTX and not catch a clue of what the bankruptcy court saw in literally five minutes -- literally no books in any sense of the word? I'm going to guess this was the least busy general counsel in corporate history - never got a phone call , never got a question, never attended a meeting?

According to other reporting, (on Yahoo) his parents have been with him in the Bahamas for the last month, and the Times says:

""Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried are part of a small group offering Mr. Bankman-Fried legal advice, according to a person familiar with the matter. The couple has also turned to the Stanford faculty for support: David Mills, a criminal law professor at Stanford and a close family friend, is part of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s legal team. Mr. Bankman has his own lawyer, the former federal prosecutor [Ronald G. White](https://wmhlaw.com/2022/10/11/ronald-g-white-joins-wmh-as-partner-in-white-collar-defense-and-investigations-practice/). ""

Have to believe he hasn't been following their advice, right? They can't have advised him to get out there and talk nonstop for a month (?)

EDIT- 
Holy cow, this is getting really intriguing. I haven’t delved into this that deeply so I guess I am missing a lot. I apologize for the paywall. This story from November says that FTX bought a Washington State bank, called Farmington State Bank, one of the smallest banks in the country. 



From the article: 

“It’s unclear how FTX was allowed to buy a stake in a U.S.-licensed bank, which would need to be approved by federal regulators. Banking veterans say it’s hard to believe that regulators would have knowingly allowed FTX to gain control of a U.S. bank.

“The fact that an offshore hedge fund that was basically a crypto firm was buying a stake in a tiny bank for multiples of its stated book value should have raised massive red flags for the F.D.I.C., state regulators and the Federal Reserve,” said Camden Fine, a bank industry consultant who used to head the Independent Community Bankers of America. “It’s just astonishing that all of this got approved.”

Prosecutors from the Southern District of New York unsealed an indictment Tuesday, charging Bankman-Fried with wire fraud and multiple counts of conspiracy, including conspiracy counts to defraud investors, lenders, and the United States, commit commodities and securities fraud and money laundering, and violate campaign finance laws.

Prosecutors allege Bankman-Fried conspired with others on numerous schemes, including misusing customer deposits held in FTX that were used to cover the expenses of Alameda. Bankman-Fried also allegedly defrauded lenders to Alameda by providing them misleading information about the hedge fund’s financial condition.

The 14-page indictment also alleges that Bankman-Fried conspired with others to violate federal election laws by making political donations to candidates and fundraising committees between 2020 and November 2022, in excess of federal legal limits and in the names of other people.",cryptocurrency,1670971292
stocks,"Inflation coming in lighter than expected is likely to be a Bearish indicator, especially in the short term","**Edit:** Down votes are totally fair for this opinion. I was just hoping to get some contrarian views as well. 

For all of 2022, the Fed has been doing their best to increase rates to try and get inflation under control. It looks like we're starting to make some progress as inflation is slowing as seen by today's report and to some degree, the past few reports.

Markets Rejoice!

But not so fast. A reduction in the month to month inflation is great and something that in the long run will be good. But what does inflation coming in below expectations mean for stocks?

A lower rate of inflation means that there are either less than expected dollars chasing the same amount of things, or it could mean there are more things out there with the same amount of dollars. Either way, it means that some or all companies could see less revenue increases or even lower revenue than estimated if we start to see deflation throughout the economy.

If the above happens, we'll start to see the next leg down in the market as earnings compress. I obviously don't have a crystal and can't say for certain it will happen but based on the Fed's actions, I personally think we haven't gotten out of this bear market quite yet.

Here are the reasons why I think we're likely to see that happen next:

1. Real average hourly earnings increased only .5% MoM and are DOWN 1.9% YoY (per the CPI report
2. Food prices rose .5% MoM and are up 10.6% YoY (I would argue this is a good that is not super elastic)
3. Shelter costs are up .6% MoM (again, I would argue this is not a super elastic good)
4. The price of goods like used cars is down 2.9% MoM and services like medical services cost declined .7% MoM.

All that is to say that we're starting to see people making less, spend less on goods and services, while continuing to spend more on goods that they HAVE TO spend on, ie shelter and food; potentially giving them even less disposable income to spend on other things.

Furthermore, from Powell's last FOMC speech, he made it clear that the markets are not fully pricing in how high rate hikes could go and that they are not likely to stop/reduce them anytime soon.

In my opinion, only when we start to see the unemployment rate go up markedly can we assume that the bear market is likely at the end, as the fed stops and reduces rates and companies start to increase their earnings again.

In the mean time, I've been continuing to add tech, especially the big boys such as aapl, amzn, googl, etc. I don't how much further we fall or if we even fall at all but I do think Big Tech is still the way of the future.

With that said, I think whatever recession and earnings decline we see will be mild to moderate as far as stocks are concerned due to many of the big player's strength coming out of covid.

stocks,Why isn't low inflation is not moving stocks? The pivot is confusing? Maybe this will help,"This is how I think about ""the pivot"", or interest rate hikes generally.

There are 4 main baskets where money can be stored: Equities (stocks), Debt (bonds), Cash, and Real estate (land/rentals). There are others.. commodities, FX, artwork... but these are the big pieces of the pie.

If inflation is slowing down, it's the expectation of wall street that the Fed will slow down interest rate hikes and at some point soon, perhaps stop altogether. According to government measurements, inflation is slowing down lately - a lot. This tracks with what I see when I go to Walmart/etc. Retailers are really starting to pump up the promotions to move inventory. Gas prices are not far from where they were pre-pandemic (inflation adjusted). Rents are beginning to adjust down as people renew leases. Houses are sitting on the market much longer.

If interest rate hikes are getting closer to the apex yield, it's no different from a stock market rout where equities are getting near as cheap as they will get. ***High bond yields mean it's expensive to be a borrower, but great to be a lender. The same way equity offers the best return when it is purchased cheapest.***

So when comparing bond yields to stock yields, if a person is expecting the bond yield is nearing it's peak, *that's the time institutional money is going to start shifting into bonds* and out of something else.

What is the something else? Considering the state of things, probably a mix of real estate and equities. In specific, the lowest yielding (most expensive) equities. Real estate is likely to be a lot slower, as it's not so fast and easy to sell.

So as long as bonds are expected to continue rising for a while yet, I don't expect any big stock rout. At least not because of bonds. Why would there be? Who wants to lock in a 10yr 3% treasury if a 4% treasury is just over the horizon?

When the fed signals they will stop hiking, that's when I would expect an influx out of the expensive equities and into the longer term bonds. If and when the fed eventually backs off and begins tapering, those peak bonds near the pivot will be more valuable than what can be purchased subsequently.

Those bonds are also sold on the secondary market, and a 4% treasury is more valuable when rates are falling and the only thing available from primary sales is a 3%.

Anybody who was lucky or smart enough to buy a bunch of long dated Treasuries in 1981 got to enjoy bond coupons nobody has had access to in US Treasuries since. But at the time there was no telling how high rates were going to have to go, or how long they'd have to stay near that peak. The fed spent most of the 80's figuring it out.

Like all things macro, there's a million factors, all relative to and acting on one another. No telling how they all interact. The best we can do is make generalized guesses and expect to be at least somewhat wrong.

gaming,"Maybe as someone that hasn't cared about achievements in the past but does now, I can explain perspective on the whole lack thereof situation with Ubi and Steam","Up until about a 8 or so years ago, I didn't care about achievements at all. Or my Steam profile as a whole, for that matter. I had a lot more time on my hands, I typically finished games at 100% or well near it pretty easily, and I moved on. I was aware of profiles but I didn't really pay them any mind, especially as someone that has zero social media.

Cut to present day and I have a much more time consuming job, far less free time, am planning on kids soon and will have even less and I'm finding that I'm spacing out my gaming sessions much more and am typically finishing games when I can, and if I like then enough, coming back to them and completing them.

This is where my love for achievements comes in. I do love the feeling of that stamp of approval and having a profile of acomplishments to look at. But aside from that, it is such a fantastic marker for progress in a game. If I took a break from a game in the past, before achievements, I'd look up a walkthrough or story digest online and would comb through the pages till I got to where I was. Looking at achievements takes seconds and is enough to jar my aging memory and unlock whatever stupid portion the games are kept it and boom - I remember what I was doing, what I was collecting, and where I was in the story.

This is paramount for open world games. Sometimes just a few days or a week are enough to make me forget all about what I was doing and where I was in the story. Moreover, those open world quests which were once monotonous and boring have just a *tad* bit more flair to them if I know I can get a stupid little stamp on my game and my profile. It's one of those things that is just enough to make me want to do a quest that, as a kid I'd happily do without an ahchievement, but as an adult I would pass right over and save my time.

Some people are overblowing the situation. But just the same, others are reacting like petulent preteens in response to someone wanting something in a game that the vast majority of games from far less popular, wealthy, or staffed companies have in their own games. Let peeps enjoy what they want. Neither side should be throwing a huge fit over it.

personalfinance,Is it possible to transfer ownership of car to a friend?,"Hi, long story short, me and my girlfriend went to a Toyota dealer in hopes to buy a car for primarily for myself with my gf as a co-signer, my credit score is in the rebuilding phase while my gf has good credit. Dealer shows us paper of the diff interest rates if we financed it together under my name with her as a co-signer, and the rate for if she buys it alone under her name. We went with the latter as the difference between interest rates and monthly payments were significant. The plan is I give my girlfriend the monthly payments and she pays it online through the dealer website.

Now we are trying to get the car insured however after contacting different insurance companies they said they’re not able to insure a car that isn’t under my name, which I understand. So my girlfriend and I came up with the solution of her starting her own policy for the car and just adding me as a second driver for the car.

However we were also brainstorming to make things easier, if there’s a way to transfer the ownership while keeping her name to be the one paying on paper (while I supply her the funds) so we keep the same monthly payments, and me being able to start my own auto insurance policy (so she doesn’t also need to pay for insurance since she has her own car she’s paying insurance for.)

We know that this couldve all been avoided if we were legally married (it’s in the works) but as of now this is our situation.

Bitcoin,Trusting Bitcoin Services and Businesses,"Bitcoin is all about understanding and managing your own risk and trust be that the decision to run a node or not, use a light wallet or not, a company node/wallet or not. You also have to decide who you will give your business to, and what risk you're willing to expose yourself to when engaging with Bitcoin services.

With that in mind let's conceptualize a few different kinds of Bitcoin services so we know to look out for them and can make educated choices as consumers.


**The Low Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service delivered in a low trust manner where the bitcoin user need only utilize software they run and control for the services and can protect themselves from malicious third parties with very little trust or consequence from peers. This is the gold standard of Bitcoin service. Examples include lightning routing, lightning liquidity marketplaces like [pool](https://lightning.engineering/pool/), [coinjoins](https://nixbitcoin.org/orderbook/) like [joinmarket](https://github.com/JoinMarket-Org/joinmarket-clientserver), [coinswaps](https://github.com/bitcoin-teleport/teleport-transactions), submarine swaps like [loop](https://lightning.engineering/loop/) and others.

When at all possible this is the kind of service you want to run. Many services and contracts, in Bitcoin or layers, will claim to be low trust - even decentralized (which isn't all necessary for a business, they are supposed to be centralized!) - but very few are. Ask yourself what recourse you alone have against fraud and what fraud would be possible. For example in lightning you protect yourself from fraud by watching the blockchain and storing proof of your off chain transactions you can broadcast at will. You have responsibility (watch the blockchain) and recourse (publish transactions proving fraud and claim balance). The risks revolve around your own capacity, time delays locking up your coins, and other general inconveniences not impacting your custody.


**Trust The Service Will Be Provided**

This is your typical business or website where you pay for the good or service before you get it and have little to no recourse if the service is not provided. Pretty normal, you're risking whatever you're spending in a transaction. Examples include every merchant business accepting bitcoin, the merchants using [BTCPay Server](https://btcpayserver.org/) and non-custodial exchanges like [bullbitcoin](https://www.bullbitcoin.com/). This is also a very good model with limited risk, but often little recourse.


**The Federated Trust Service**

This is a bitcoin service which spreads responsibility across a number of actors for success or failure. It's not nearly as good as trusting yourself and relies on third parties to protect your interests. Examples include [Liquid](https://liquid.net/), [RSK](https://www.rsk.co/) peg, Multisig custodians, [BISQ](https://bisq.network/) escrow. These services often delve into shitcoins and when they do should be avoided like any other.  The risk in these cases is often not exceptionally limited, include custody, and your recourse relies on third parties if any exists at all.


**The First Party Custodian**

This bitcoin service relies on only itself. It often prides itself on this self reliance, boasting a lack of third parties and self custody. [River Financial](https://river.com/) is a good example. If you can trust the one business, these can be quality services. They can also be horrible rug pulling scams. The risks in these custodians are similar to a federated service, but only trusting one party. As with all custodians at and below this point the correct answer is don't use a custodian.


**The 3rd Party Custodian**

This is a bitcoin service which relies on a third party custodian, like [Prime Trust](https://www.primetrust.com/). Examples include [Strike](https://strike.me/) and [Swan](https://www.swanbitcoin.com/) among many others. While both are Bitcoin only companies, the custodian they rely on holds [over 70 shitcoins](https://www.primetrust.com/qualified-custody). These kinds of services can be dangerous because they can appear to be very bold Bitcoin only companies, but on [closer inspection](https://strike.me/faq/bitcoincustody/) you will find they don't self custody - a central tenant of a good Bitcoin participant in the space, user and business alike. This can expose users to all kinds of risks and broadens the number of actors exposing users to risk, even if it's not just custody. For example [Kraken just leaked user data](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/yz85kg/psa_kraken_breach_of_security/) via a Zendesk leak. This is why evaluating who you are trusting is important and I make these specific examples to illustrate why you can't take even well respected community members at their word you need to evaluate for yourself - are you trusting them or a tower of service providers? Other Examples on the more severely negative end of this description include lending platforms like Blockfi and Celcius, where the tower of third party dependency extends through custodianship and lending and other abusive business models. These businesses can run the gamut from moderately acceptable to horrible run for your life - depending largely on the complexity of the tower of 3rd party dependency and the severity of risk each party exposes you to.


**The Shitcoin Casino**

This isn't a Bitcoin service at all, it's a public harm. These are exchanges which service and host scams, exposing their users to the custodial risks of their shittiest shitcoin. They often print their own shitcoins. They lure users in with too-good-to-be-true fees. They should be avoided at all cost. Examples include FTX, Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, Gemini, KuCoin, and many many others. Most others. I won't be linking them because you shouldn't use them.

**TL;DR:**

As you evaluate what kind of businesses and services you want to use, what risks you're willing to expose yourself and your coins to, and hopefully even what kind of businesses you want to encourage in this space - consider all your options. Not every service has made the same trade offs or requires the same trust. Consider minimizing your exposure to this ""contagion"" and not only get off exchanges and custodial services, but reevaluate the services we're doing business with in the first place. Avoid shitcoin custodians and services. Use lower trust solutions. Let's do more diligence on who we are trusting and how.",cryptocurrency,1671003461

stocks,"Profit driven inflation, not wage inflation?","I came across this article (see below) highlighting why the author thinks the Fed's rate hikes have failed to control inflation. 
I'm no economist so looking for some THOUGHTFUL insight into this as its sort of anecdotal. If inflation is driven by profits then how to curb it?
[*not sure what flair to choose]


The Fed Is Dead – OpEd
 December 14, 2022
By Robert Reich

The Fed is meeting Tuesday. Wednesday, presumably, it will raise interest rates again in its continuing attempt to stem inflation by slowing the economy.

But the Fed’s rate hikes aren’t working. Despite seven straight increases in just nine months, totaling a whopping 4.25 percentage points — a pace not seen since the Fed’s inflation fight in the 1980s — price increases are still hovering near four-decade highs.

The Fed’s rate hikes are slowing the economy, but not prices. Why not?

The Fed’s failure to stem inflation is partly due to events outside the United States — Putin’s war in Ukraine, China’s lockdown, and post-COVID demand worldwide exceeding worldwide supplies of all sorts of materials and components.

But it’s also because domestic inflation is being driven by profits, not wages. And interest rate hikes don’t reduce profit-driven inflation — at least not directly. Instead, workers and consumers take the hit.

Labor costs increased 5.3 percent over the past year. But prices rose 7.3 percent. This means the real purchasing power of American workers continues to drop.

Forget the 1970s wage-price spiral when real average earnings continued to rise for much of the decade. Now, workers are taking it on the chin.

Profits have grown faster than labor costs for seven of the past eight quarters. As Paul Donovan, chief economist for UBS’s Global Wealth Management, wrote last week, “today’s price inflation is more a product of profits than wages.”

Corporate profits surged to a record high of $2.08 trillion in the third quarter of this year, even as inflation continued to squeeze workers and consumers. Over the last two years, quarterly profits have ballooned more than 80 percent, from around $1.2 trillion to more than $2 trillion.

Executives of big companies across America continue to tell Wall Street they can keep prices high or raise them even higher. As Pepsi Co. financial chief Hugh Johnston said on his company’s third quarter earnings call, “ [we’re] capable of taking whatever pricing we need.”

Not every business is raking it in, to be sure. Most small businesses aren’t sharing in the profit bonanza because everything they need for putting stuff on the shelves has gone up in price.

But the big ones have never done as well. 

In fact, rather than slowing corporate price increases, the Fed’s rate hikes seem to be having the opposite effect.

It’s not hard to see why. If I run a big corporation, I’m not going to lower my prices and profits in the face of a pending economic slowdown. I’ll do everything I can to keep them as high as possible for as long as I can.

I’ll reduce my prices and profits only when the Fed’s higher rates begin hurting consumers enough that they stop buying stuff at my high prices because they can find better deals elsewhere.

Yet if I have a monopoly or near-monopoly — as is increasingly the case with big American corporations — my consumers won’t have much choice. If they want and need my stuff, they’ll continue to buy at the higher prices.

Of course, I’ll keep telling them I have no choice but to keep raising my prices because my costs keep increasing — even though that’s bunk because I’m increasing my profit margins.

Eventually, the Fed could raise interest rates so high that the cost of borrowing makes it impossible for consumers — whose wages, remember, are already dropping, adjusted for inflation — to afford what I’m selling, thereby forcing me to stop raising my prices.

But by this time, people will be hurting. Many will have lost economic ground. Some will have become impoverished. A large number of jobs will have been lost.

The Fed should stop believing it can easily stop profit-price inflation by hiking interest rates. It should pause interest-rate hikes long enough to see — and allow the nation to see — they’re harming workers and consumers more than corporations that continue to rake in record profits.  

The government should use other means to tame inflation. Like what?

Like windfall profits taxes as California’s governor Gavin Newsom has proposed for oil companies there, and Representative Ro Khanna and Senator Sheldon Whitehouse have proposed nationally (taxing the difference between the current price of oil per barrel and the average cost between 2015 and 2019).

Like tough antitrust enforcement aimed at reducing the pricing power of big corporations (as Lina Kahn is attempting at the Federal Trade Commission and Jonathan Kanter is trying at the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department).

Like a new antitrust law that allows enforcers to bust up big corporations (and prevent them from buying other businesses) when they’re powerful enough to continue raising their prices higher than their costs are rising. (Could Republicans in Congress be coaxed into supporting this? I believe so.)

It’s important that Americans know the truth. Seven Fed rate hikes in just nine months have barely dented corporate power to raise prices and profit margins. 

Which is why the Fed is putting the onus of fighting inflation on workers and consumers rather than on the corporations responsible for it.

This is wrong. It’s bad economics. It’s insane politics. And it’s profoundly unfair.",finance,1671014393
personalfinance,Debt advice please (UK),"Hi guys,  looking for a bit of advice on my current financial situation please.

Situation, me (40, Government IT, £30k) and my wife (46, Teacher/Management £45k).

We have a house and 2 kids, but we have racked up a fair chunk of debt due to her being off on maternity and general overspending.

Our mortgage is up for renewal in 12 months' time so looking to get debt down in the next 12 months.

I have a loan (£375 p/m) which is also due to end in 12 months' time which is handy as this may cover any potential rise in mortgage due to increase in interest rate (currently on fixed 2.39%)

Anyway............

We have credit card debt:

Card 1: Sainsburys:  £9,750

Card 2: Virgin: £6,950

Card 3: Tesco: £7,600

Card 4: MBNA,: £4,950

Card 5: Barclaycard: £1,100

Card 6: TSB: £1,450

Total of £31,800.

The wife likes to bury her head in the sand knowing that eventually we'll inherit a good chunk of cash from both sent of parents and houses etc, but i'm a worrier and would like this reduced as its giving me sleepless nights.

Our joint income monthly is around £4,700

Mortgage is £720

Gas &amp; Elec, £250

Council tax, £180

Sky TV &amp; Mobiles £200

Petrol, £150

Gyms, £240

Water, Insurances, Vet/Pet stuff, £300 ish

Car £225 (1 more payment)

Credit Card payments, £700

Kids Clubs, £150

Food Shopping, £600

We are left with approx £500 per month, soon to be about £750 once the car has paid off.

Looking for advice please. Was going to try and pay off the smallest card first and then 2nd smallest etc but upping the payments by piling in the month saved from 1st card paid off etc, bit like a domino effect.

Also looking at a side hussle/business to see if i can earn a bit extra either selling stuff online etc so may off a bit more.

Me:
What are the best crypto projects in your opinion? Which one will be most profitable to invest in over the next 5 years?

ChatGPT:
I believe the best crypto projects to invest in over the next 5 years are those with strong teams, solid technology, and real-world use cases. Some examples of these projects are Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin. These have proven track records and a strong user base, making them a solid investment for the long term.

Me:
Where do you see the Bitcoin price in 5 years? Where in 10? Try to make an estimate in USD.

ChatGPT:
It is difficult to make an exact prediction of the Bitcoin price in 5 or 10 years as the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various factors. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Bitcoin could potentially reach $100,000 in 5 years and $250,000 in 10 years. Of course, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What about ETH in USD?

ChatGPT:
Similarly to Bitcoin, the price of Ethereum in USD is difficult to predict with certainty. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Ethereum could potentially reach $10,000 in 5 years and $25,000 in 10 years. Again, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What are the best crypto projects to look out for other than the 3 mentioned?

ChatGPT:
There are many promising crypto projects to look out for, in addition to the ones already mentioned. Some examples include Cardano, Chainlink, and Binance Coin. These projects have strong teams, innovative technology, and real-world use cases, making them worth considering for investment. It is important to thoroughly research and evaluate any potential investment before making a decision.

Me:
Why do you like Cardano? Why Chainlink? Why Binance Coin?

ChatGPT:
I like Cardano for its strong team and innovative technology. Cardano uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is more energy-efficient and scalable than proof-of-work. It also has a unique governance model and is working on implementing smart contract functionality. These factors make it a strong contender in the crypto market.
I like Chainlink for its focus on bridging the gap between the blockchain world and the real world. Its decentralized oracle network allows for secure and reliable data transmission between off-chain and on-chain systems, making it a valuable tool for many different industries.
I like Binance Coin for its strong adoption and use cases. Binance Coin is the native token of the Binance platform, one of the largest and most popular crypto exchanges in the world. It is used for a variety of purposes on the platform, such as paying fees, participating in token sales, and accessing exclusive features. Its widespread adoption and utility make it a solid investment option.

Me:
Where do you see the Chainlink price in 5 years?

ChatGPT:
Again, it is difficult to make an exact prediction of the Chainlink price in 5 years as the crypto market is highly volatile and subject to various factors. However, based on its current market trend and adoption rate, I believe the price of Chainlink could potentially reach $50 in 5 years. Of course, this is only an estimate and actual price movements may vary.

Me:
What are the biggest risks to Bitcoin? Ethereum?

ChatGPT:
The biggest risks to Bitcoin and Ethereum are their highly volatile nature, regulatory uncertainty, and potential for hacks and security breaches. The crypto market is subject to sudden price swings, making it a risky investment for those who are not prepared for potential losses. Additionally, governments and financial institutions around the world are still figuring out how to regulate cryptocurrencies, which can create uncertainty and hinder adoption. Finally, the decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies makes them vulnerable to hacks and other security breaches, which can result in significant losses for investors. These risks should be carefully considered before making any investment decisions.

personalfinance,"Thinking about buying a $36,000 car - should I?","Hello Reddit personal finance!
As the title says, I’m thinking about buying a $36k car.  It is a 2020 Acura MDX, fully-loaded Advance/Entertainment/Towing packages.  Would be a great all-purpose family car.  Would be our third MDX but by far the newest and most expensive.  In the past we had a 2005 MDX purchased for $10k, and a 2007 purchased for $8700.  Total price would be $38500 and our loan would be for $32,000 over 84 months, but we’d pay it off early (we always do, always have with all of our cars so far).  Interest rate would be 6.09%.  Payment $470/month.

About me - 39 years old, same company for 16 years, wife and two kids.

Financial stats - 841 credit score, $200k household income, home purchased for $95k (still owe around $70k), no other debt

I did some rough calculating and I think we can save 40% of our net income, pay all bills, have $1,000 “fudge-factor” and still have $1750 per month left over.  This is after already contributing to 401(k) and paying health insurance.

I have heard the 10% rule but I’ve heard it stated two ways, either based on gross annual income, or on monthly income.
We have over $10k net monthly income so this would give us a budget up to $1,000/month on the car.
Gross annual income around $200k so this only gives us a budget of $20k though, am I right?

Other rough math, our 2007 MDX would cost us around $17k over the next 7 years, for maintenance, insurance, and registration.  The 2020 MDX would cost us $63k!  This is the part that’s freaking me out a bit.  Although, 7 years is awhile.  My daughter is 10 now, can’t imagine her at 17…only a car loan away!

I have everything all lined up to buy this but I’m getting cold feet.
It’s either this, or keep both of our older cars running.  We have a 2017 Chevy Volt with 140k miles on it and I’m slightly concerned if anything goes wrong with it, it will take awhile to fix (parts shortages) or cost a fortune (hybrid battery).  Other vehicle is a 2007 MDX, with 196,000 miles.  Just had a $400 repair done on it, it’s scratched up, has a little rust…

Could also look for a cheaper used car but I want to feel like I’m getting an “upgrade” you know?  A lot of used cars I’m finding between $15-22k don’t feel like much of an upgrade but maybe I’m just picky.  This MDX has all the features I’d need to last the next decade.

CryptoCurrency,Citi expects a broader focus on decentralization in 2023 following this year’s failings in centralized crypto ventures,"[https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/14/citi-says-crypto-market-leverage-open-interest-are-historically-low/](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/12/14/citi-says-crypto-market-leverage-open-interest-are-historically-low/)

The past year in the digital asset market has been characterized by a series of negative shocks, triggered initially by the collapse of Terra/LUNA, Citi (C) said in a research report Monday looking back on the year.

“Leverage, volatility and interest have faded as investors battle with declining prices,” analysts led by Joseph Ayoub wrote. “Retail interest has broadly diminished as prices have declined,” and this has “coincided with a more general decline in volatility.”

Institutional interest has also declined. This “loss of trust” followed the failure of many centralized entities, and is reflected in exchange-traded-product (ETP) flows, which have remained negative throughout the year, the report said.

Against a broader macro backdrop of inflation concerns, rising interest rates and tightening financial conditions, total crypto market cap has declined by about 61% compared to an 18% drop for the S&amp;P 500 index, the report added.

The bank says the bankruptcies of crypto exchange FTX and lenders Celsius and Voyager were failures of centralized entities rather than decentralized entities, “perhaps signifying the resilience of decentralized finance protocols.” DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of financial applications carried out on a blockchain.

Bitcoin open interest saw a significant decline, the note said. It started the year at more than $23 billion and has dropped to around $9 billion. Leverage has also largely declined. Open interest is the total number of outstanding derivative contracts held by investors and represents active positions.

The bank notes there is still over $150 billion in market cap across stablecoins. This type of cryptocurrency saw only 5% net redemptions in 2022. However, relative declines show different investor behavior and diverging confidence in stablecoins, with tether (USDT) losing as much as $10 billion in market cap, while USD Coin (USDC) stayed roughly level and Binance USD (BUSD) increased.

Spot trading volumes have remained resilient despite falling crypto prices, and decentralized exchange (DEX) volumes have grown in recent weeks following the collapse of FTX. The demise of FTX has “further bolstered policymaker calls for crypto regulation, placing a greater emphasis on consumer protection,” according to the note.",cryptocurrency,1671018037

Forex,Upcoming FOMC interest rates decision?,"I’ve been reading on fxstreet to keep myself updated and be prepared, so basically there are possibly 3 scenarios here 🙀

As expected
1.Dovish (hike 50 bps, range 4.25-4.5%)
= USD sell off

Extremely Unlikely
2.Hawkish (hike 75 bps, range 5+%)
= USD rally

Possibly 
3.Neutral (Same as Dovish but Powell adopts HAWKISH tone aka. He could downplay the soft Nov CPI figures sacrificing in order to control the taming inflation)

= USD could recover and hold its ground even though initial reaction might not.

personalfinance,House or Retirement?,"Hello, single 30M here that's been stressing non-stop about having enough money during retirement.

Let me preface by saying I'm absolute shit at budgeting. I try to make sure I'm meeting my necessities, bills, and savings goals but essentially don't track the rest of my money.

\- Take Home: $8640 (after maxing 401k and HSA)

\- Retirement savings: $38k

\- 6M e-fund: $30k ($10k of which are in an ibond)

401k and HSA contributions are set to allow me to meet the annual limit ($22.5k/yr and $3850/yr) and I will also max the Roth limit ($6.5k/yr -- backdoor). I have another $2k/month that I've started to put into a taxable account for retirement purposes as well, but have also wanted to start saving for a house down payment (hopefully within the next 1-1.5 years). I typically wouldn't stress about the down payment (since I'll use a VA loan), but with interest rates as high as they are, I'd rather owe less than more. My question is whether the 401k/HSA/Roth are enough for me to retire on, or should I continue investing the $2k/month into a taxable account at the expense of not having as big of a down payment?",finance,1671021491

# [Stock futures are muted as investors await the Federal Reserve’s rate decision](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/13/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors awaited the Federal Reserve’s latest interest rate hike decision in its effort to crush inflation.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures dipped 2 points, or less than 0.1%. Futures tied to the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were also roughly flat.
*****
&gt; The Fed will conclude its December meeting and is expected to deliver a 50 basis-point rate hike. That’s a smaller bump after four consecutive 75 basis point hikes. A basis point is equal to one hundredth of one percent.
*****
&gt; Chair Jerome Powell will also speak Wednesday, giving further clues about what’s coming from the Fed in 2023. In previous meetings this year, traders have been sensitive to Powell’s language, interpreting his tone as hawkish or dovish.
*****
&gt; “While we expect the Fed to slow the pace of rate rises at its Wednesday meeting, policymakers are likely to stress that the job of curbing inflation is not yet over,” UBS’ Mark Haefele wrote in a Wednesday note. “A slowing of job creation and wage growth will be needed before the Fed can stop hiking.”
*****
&gt; Stocks rose for a second day Tuesday, fueled by a cooler-than-anticipated inflation report. The November consumer price index was 7.1% on the year, less than the 7.3% gain expected by economists surveyed by Dow Jones. The 0.1% increase from the previous month was also less than forecast.
*****
&gt; The signal that inflation may have peaked was positive for stocks as it means the Fed may be one step closer to halting interest rate hikes or switching to cuts, which would fuel equities.

ROI,How is Irish people's perception of homelessness still so archaic?,"I'm homeless. Twice **today** I've had accusations thrown at me that I'm lying about that, because people can't argue a point and go post history diving, and find the utterly audacious reality that yes; to stay sane I play games (I watch movies and read books too). 

It's 2022. How do people **still** attribute all homelessness with chronic homelessness? No. I have never sat in the street and begged. No. I have never asked anyone for any money. No. I am not in this situation by choice, I had a place, got notice in the summer. Yes, I own devices. I have a laptop. I have a cheap tablet for college reading. Both are used heavily in the course so I can unfuck my situation. No, you would not clock me for homeless just walking past me, the stuffed backpack and layers would be your only clue, and that's why I've looked the other way on this topic for years, because people literally don't see us, we're hidden homeless. This goes for everyone in my hostel, which is (on paper hehe) a dry hostel. You wouldn't make us for homeless. But yes. A few of us have the gall to have laptops, even for entertainment. Tablets are popular for those who aren't tech savvy, those of advanced years etc. A few years ago another Irish redditor I saw made mention that he even had his PS4 running in his hostel (must be a nicer place than my digs). No, we won't sell these devices to inject the money into our veins to satisfy your outdated preconceptions of what a homeless person is. Let's bring ourselves up to the modern day people. I became homeless in September. I owned stuff before that. A hell of a lot of stuff got sold. I kept the stuff that was mobile enough. Why in your mind should I have sold everything? **It wouldn't have got me accommodation**, have you seen the queues of people waiting for viewings? Have you seen the rents?

personalfinance,Student needing 529 Advice,"Hi all, I am a current med student. In May 2023, I will begin my final year of school, which is comprised of three externships/rotations. It is a really cool opportunity to live and work elsewhere and gain clinical experience beyond what is offered at the clinic on my campus. I have chosen some great locations in places I have never been to, and I am excited.

Currently, I live on student loans/federal work study money exclusively. It is not really feasible for me to work in any capacity outside of my school and clinical obligations, nor do I want to at this time. With the nature of short term living arrangements being more expensive than annual leases and the way things are heading with inflation/possible recession looming, I am in need of some advice.

My loan money will not fully cover, or at best will just barely cover the cost of living during the next year when I am out and about on externships. If I take out the max amount and still can't pay rent, I am sort of SOL, the way my financial aid office describes things. Thankfully, I have a 529 I haven't used yet in grad school as I was anticipating needing it for this very purpose.

I currently have ~$8k in my 529. This is down significantly from about $15k early this summer, as I'm sure y'all can relate to. This would _probably_ be enough for me to live off of my 4th year of school in conjunction with my student loans, but I'd love if it could recover some more, even a few thousand dollars, to give myself some much needed extra padding. If it's more than I need, I could apply it immediately to my student loans or save it as an emergency fund post graduation.

I also hate the idea of taking it all out now at a major loss, but if it gets too much lower, I'm concerned it definitely won't be enough to support me until May 2024. I know nobody can predict the future, but I suppose the heart of my question is, should I clean out my account now, or wait for the market to recover somewhat before pulling it out? The way I understand it, I can't really access it after I graduate (without penalty), so I intend to clean it out no later than April 2024 no matter what happens, but my most expensive semesters in order during 4th year will be fall (Sep-Dec 2023), summer (May-Aug 2023), and finally spring 2024, so that is when I will need it most.

I'd appreciate any insights or advice in how to handle this situation, or when you think would be the optimal time to pull the funds out and close the account (lump sum, or as needed???). Thank you.",finance,1671031456

Bitcoin,Bitcoin Vs. CBDCs: SpyCoin Coming soon,"Bitcoin vs. CBDCs: Spycoin Coming Soon

So we already have micro CBDC’s in the form of social security benefits, ebt, disability income, among other government subsidized programs. CBDC’s would basically be the United States dollar, except there will be more rules in regards to how exactly you can use a CBDC. For example, there may be a limit to what type of items you can buy (You probably won’t be able to buy liquor or tobacco with a CBDC. If you are, it will probably only be on the weekends in the afternoon, or something parental like that).  

Bitcoin is important because while a CBDC is basically a dollar that impinges on your privacy, the bitcoin network makes sure your payment will be accepted, no matter what. Imagine an international bank that never closes and audits every transaction every 10 minutes to ensure the validity of the network; that’s bitcoin. 

Jerome Powell controls the price of money, so he could arguably be the most powerful man in the world. The issuance and regulation of CBDCs by central banks could give governments too much control over the flow of money in the economy. 

This could allow governments to track and monitor individual transactions in a way that could infringe on privacy rights.

Another potential concern is that the widespread adoption of CBDCs could make it easier for governments to implement harmful monetary policies, such as negative interest rates. Negative interest rates can have detrimental effects on the economy, including reducing the incentive for individuals and businesses to save and invest. 

Bitcoin is a global currency that can be used and accepted anywhere in the world, whereas CBDCs are tied to a specific country and can only be used within that country's borders. 

This makes bitcoin a more attractive option for individuals and businesses that operate internationally or want to conduct business with people in other countries.

The use of bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that transactions can be made without revealing the identity of the parties involved. This can provide a higher level of privacy and security than transactions made using a CBDC, which would be subject to the same regulations and oversight as transactions made using fiat currency.


CBDCs may be perceived as a positive change in the financial system, but in actuality it will create more problems than solutions. Bitcoin offers a permissionless, decentralized, and everlasting alternative that gives users more control over their own funds and provides greater privacy and security. And that makes the world a better place.",cryptocurrency,1671033698

bigdata,Five methods to increase governance over your data clients,"## Define schemas.

A schema defines the structure of your data. The fields and types the other side expects to receive. Having well-defined schemas and a single source of truth that store all your different models is a must as you scale and more interfaces join the party and request to consume from different data sources.  
As schema changes will be requested, you would only need to perform the change once. (Have you got the chance to give [schemaverse](https://medium.com/memphis-dev/five-methods-to-increase-governance-over-your-data-clients-4eb7423510d6) a spin?)

## Enforce.

You have to govern, or you will lose control. If you made a data contract both theoretically or technically, you need to enforce it.  
Ensure data will not reach clients in a way they didn't ask for.

## Dedicated identity per client.

As your organization grows, more and more “hands” will request to interact with the ingested data. It can be different clients, applications, and/or stakeholders.  
Make sure each client receives a unique identity that can be traced and monitored, and in case some data-level / infra-level occurred, you would know who got affected, from which team, and the business impact instantly. It will help reach root-cause much faster than shooting slack messages and emails to the entire organization.

## Auditing.

In a federated architecture and data pipelines, where multiple domains, teams, and clients are often intertwined, one configuration change can create a chain of reactions that ultimately will crash the entire process. Auditing is crucial to ensure you approach the upstream rather than the middle.

## Notifications.

Last but not least, notifications. Don't react when your staging environment or your tables/documents are already unaligned, or backends start to crash. Make sure you have notifications configured in every step of your pipeline. You get notified immediately if something goes wrong and data is not ingested as it should. Combining dedicated identity with auditing and a clear notification will enable you to sleep better. In case you awaken in the middle of the night, it will be for a short time and with all the information needed to fix it.

Bitcoin,No Regret Stacking,"I started investing in Bitcoin about this time last year. Yeah, the ATH. At that time I very much had two mindsets. 1) As a libertarian, anti-FED computer programmer, I *finally* fell in love with the beauty, simplicity, and transparency of Bitcoin - God knows why it took me so long, but it probably is related to the second point. 2) I definitely at the time was in a betting/gambling mindset where FOMO was a big motivation, and this tendency is likely why I ignored Bitcoin for so long - I assumed I had “missed the boat.”

So this leads me to today. In the last year, I put most of my savings into Bitcoin and I DCA’d a a solid 15% of my take-home pay as well. I would have more USD value had I just saved in cash (like I had been doing for a couple years prior). Yet, I have no regrets, and I want to say why.

I was lucky to have a mentor in Bitcoin who both stoked the flames of my passion, but also constantly reminded me of the core principles and goals of Bitcoin, and he would say “please, only put into Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.”

I took that advice, though I was a bit liberal with the definition of “what I can afford to lose.” But still remained within the bounds of no regrets. While I put a LOT into BTC, I maintained a substantial emergency fund in USD, I did not completely ignore my 401k, and never once did I have to sell any Bitcoin.

I have transitioned from wanting the price to go higher for my value in USD to go up, to wanting the price to go down to be able to buy more BTC, to finally not caring what the price is and stacking regardless.

This is the only asset in the world that will keep its scarcity. I’m just glad to be able to obtain any amount of it without putting the rest of my life at risk.

economy,Powell Announces 50BPS Interest Rate Hike in 2022’s Final FOMC Meeting,,finance,1671044529
stocks,Fed raises interest rates half a point to highest level in 15 years,"The Federal Reserve on Wednesday raises its benchmark interest rate to the highest level in 15 years, indicating that the fight against inflation is not over yet despite some promising signs lately.

Keeping with expectations, the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee voted to boost the overnight borrowing rate half a percentage point, taking it to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5%. The increase broke a string of four straight three-quarter point hikes, the most aggressive policy moves since the early 1980s. 

Along with the increase came an indication that officials expect to keep rates higher through next year, with no reductions until 2024. The expected “terminal rate,” or point where officials expect to end the rate hikes, was put at 5.1%, according to the FOMC’s “dot plot” of individual members’ expectations. 

The new level marks the highest the fed funds rate has been since December 2007, just ahead of the global financial crisis and as the Fed was loosening policy aggressively to combat what would turn into the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. 

This time around, the Fed is raising rates into what is expected to be a moribund economy in 2023. 

Members penciled in increases for the funds rate until it hits a median level of 5.1% next year, equivalent to a target range of 5%-5.25. At that point, officials are likely to pause to allow the impact of the monetary policy tightening make its way through the economy. 

The consensus then pointed to a full percentage point worth of rate cuts in 2024, taking the funds rate to 4.1% by the end of that year. That is followed by another percentage point of cuts in 2025 to a rate of 3.1%, before the benchmark settles into a longer-run neutral level of 2.5%. 

However, there was a fairly wide dispersion in the outlook for future years, indicating that members are uncertain about what is ahead for an economy dealing with the worst inflation it has seen since the early 1980s. 

The newest dot plot featured multiple members seeing rates heading considerably higher than the median point for 2023 and 2024. For 2023, seven of the 19 committee members – voters and nonvoters included – saw rates rising above 5.25%. Similarly, there were seven members who saw rates higher than the median 4.1% in 2024.

The FOMC policy statement, approved unanimously, was virtually unchanged from November’s meeting. Some observers had expected the Fed to alter language that it sees “ongoing increases” ahead to something less committal, but that phrase remained in the statement.

Fed officials believe raising rates helps take money out the economy, reducing demand and ultimately pulling prices lower after inflation spiked to its highest level in more than 40 years.

The FOMC lowered its growth targets for 2023, putting expected GDP gains at just 0.5%, barely above what would be considered a recession. The GDP outlook for this year also was put at 0.5%. In the September projections, the committee expected 0.2% growth this year and 1.2% next.

The committee also raised its median anticipation of its favored core inflation measure to 4.8%, up 0.3 percentage points from the September outlook. Members slightly lowered their unemployment rate outlook for this year and bumped it a bit higher for the ensuing years.

The rate hike follows consecutive reports showing progress in the inflation fight.

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that the consumer price index rose just 0.1% in November, a smaller increase than expected as the 12-month rate dropped to 7.1%. Excluding food and energy, the core CPI rate was at 6%. Both measures were the lowest since December 2021. A level the Fed puts more weight on, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, fell to a 5% annual rate in October.

However, all of those readings remain well above the Fed’s 2% target. Officials have stressed the need to see consistent declines in inflation and have warned against relying too much on trends over just a few months.

Central bankers still feel they have leeway to raise rates, as hiring remains strong and consumers, who drive about two-thirds of all U.S. economic activity, are continuing to spend.

Nonfarm payrolls grew by a faster than expected 263,000 in November, while the Atlanta Fed is tracking GDP growth of 3.2% for the fourth quarter. Retail sales grew 1.3% in October and were up 8.3% on an annual basis, indicating that consumers so far are weathering the inflation storm.

Inflation came about from a convergence of at least three factors: Outsized demand for goods during the pandemic that created severe supply chain issues, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine that coincided with a spike in energy prices, and trillions in monetary and fiscal stimulus that created a glut of dollars looking for a place to go.

After spending much of 2021 dismissing the price increases as “transitory,” the Fed started raising interest rates in March of this year, first tentatively and then more aggressively, with the previous four increases in 0.75 percentage point increments. Prior to this year, the Fed had not raised rates more than a quarter point at a time in 22 years.

The Fed also has been engaged in “quantitative tightening,” a process in which it is allowing proceeds from maturing bonds to roll off its balance sheet each month rather than reinvesting them.

A capped total of $95 billion is being allowed to run off each month, resulting in a $332 billion decline in the balance sheet since early June. The balance sheet now stands at $8.63 trillion.

The bill would subject miners, validators, and others in the crypto world to ""know your customer"" and anti-money laundering obligations. It's hard to see how that is compatible with decentralized crypto, and the result would be to force a massive centralization of crypto (at least in the US). Those pushing the bill frame it as a response to SBF/FTX, but of course it's hard to see how a failure of a *centralized* crypto exchange justifies regulation of *decentralized* crypto. Plus, KYC &amp; AML have nothing to do with protecting consumers from fraud and, instead, are all about the government effectively spying on those same consumers. 

Whether that specific bill goes anywhere or not, it's a sign of things to come. In fact--less dramatic but just as important--the federal agency FinCEN is proposing a regulation that would expand other aspects of the KYC/AML framework to transactions between unhosted and hosted wallets. 

Since this is the censorship-free forum, I think it's OK to post this here: 

I'm a constitutional lawyer at a public interest law firm called the Institute for Justice, where I defend financial privacy and economic freedom. (Check my bio, where you can see I did a post on r/AMA with verification.) I'm looking into a variety of potential cases to protect decentralized crypto from overbearing KYC/AML regulations, and I'm hoping to connect with folks in the crypto community who would be willing to serve as plaintiffs.

2022 was a challenging year for risky investments. It started with FED's news about increasing rates. The next FED meeting began with a 25 basis points hike, and keep increasing to 75 basis points next FED meetings. Today with a smaller rate hike than the last one was a sign that inflation is getting better.

**What does that mean for CryptoCurrencies?**

* Raising rates makes it costly to take out a loan, causing people to borrow and spend less. So it's still costly to take out a loan, and that means still less money flow to risky investments like cryptocurrencies.
* **But** for investors, a lower rate hike is pretty good news, and they will add more risky assets like cryptocurrencies to their investments since they get it like things getting better. That would start a new bull run cycle of the crypto market if rate hikes keep lowering every FED meeting.

stocks,Why do stocks decline whenever investors think the Fed will raise rates?,"If the Fed raises rates too high, then the next economic recession would be sooner and then the need to lower rates will be a little sooner instead of a little later. When the rates have to be lowered again, the price of stocks, bonds and houses would increase to return to normal levels again. Raising rates today shouldn't effect the price of stocks if you think long term.

If the Fed raises rates only enough to control inflation yet not slow the economy too much, then the Fed is doing it's job of keeping the dollar stable and doing a 'soft landing' to keep the economy from overheating yet not cause a big recession. That shouldn't have an effect on the price of stocks.

If the Fed keeps rates too low, then I think we will have more inflation that would slow the economy, turn to stagflation, cause a hard landing and then a recession.  If inflation is allowed to get completely out of control, inflation would crash the economy if we have to turn to a barter economy when a wheel barrow full of $100 dollar bills taped into bricks of money isn't enough to buy a loaf of bread. Either way, it seems the Fed keeping rates too low and the prospects of having to increase rates in the future would cause fear and the price of stocks to decline.",finance,1671046651

Eight men who used social media platforms to promote stocks they owned were charged by federal prosecutors with engaging in a $144 million “pump and dump” scheme.

Edward Constantinescu, known on Twitter as “@MrZackMorris,” and Perry Matlock, whose Twitter handle is “@PJ\_Matlock,” were among the defendants charged in an indictment unsealed Tuesday in federal court in Houston.

Constantinescu and Matlock are co-founders of Atlas Trading, a stock-trading forum on the Discord social media platform. Constantinescu has more than 550,000 Twitter followers, according to the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which sued the eight men yesterday. Matlock has 340,000.

The shares they hyped were in little-known companies including [GTT Communications Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/GTTNQ:US), [Surface Oncology Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/SURF:US) and [Universe Pharmaceuticals Inc.](https://archive.vn/o/rhUG5/https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/UPC:US), according to the indictment.

Also charged were Thomas Cooperman (“Tommy Coops”) Gary Deel (“Mystic Mac”), Mitchell Hennessey (“Hugh Henne”) Stefan Hrvatin (“LadeBackk”), Daniel Knight (“Deity of Dips”) and John Rybarczyk (“Ultra Calls, “The Stock Sniper”).

&gt;So, when you hear the economists predicting that inflation could reach 2% by mid-year 2023, it isn’t just wishful thinking. It’s a tactful analysis on the impact a slowing economy, lagging rate hikes, recessionary fears, and a 40-year-high relative comparison (mid-year was the inflationary high of 2022).

&gt;The bottom line: Powell saying that Fed will consider cutting rates when the Fed is confident that inflation is “moving towards 2%” is like saying, “Forget everything I said about staying the course. Forget about ‘higher for longer.’ We’re turning the money printer back on sooner than you think.”

Article makes the point that high YoY inflation comparisons will likely take us to lower CPI readings, and consequently give Powell room to cut rates.

&gt;So, when you hear the economists predicting that inflation could reach 2% by mid-year 2023, it isn’t just wishful thinking. It’s a tactful analysis on the impact a slowing economy, lagging rate hikes, recessionary fears, and a 40-year-high relative comparison (mid-year was the inflationary high of 2022).

&gt;The bottom line: Powell saying that Fed will consider cutting rates when the Fed is confident that inflation is “moving towards 2%” is like saying, “Forget everything I said about staying the course. Forget about ‘higher for longer.’ We’re turning the money printer back on sooner than you think.”

Article makes the point that high YoY inflation comparisons will likely take us to lower CPI readings, and consequently give Powell room to cut rates.

How I see it we are already in a recession, we have passed the peak point of the recession, and coming to a recovery . The reason for it is the rising interest rate, which have to rise because of inflation. In the last 2 CPI reports, inflation has slowed significantly. Before inflation rose sharply due to the high gas price, now you can go to you local gas station and see that fuel is on a down trend. 

The fed is also slowing their interest rate rise to 0.5%. I can see an end to this high inflation issue that we are having and returning back to normal. I’m buying heavy every chance i get.

investing,Overview of the FOMC meeting,"**From the 2 PM EST release:**

* Raised the benchmark policy rate by 50 bps to 4.25-4.50%

* Raised the 2023 terminal rate to 5.00-5.25% from 4.50-4.75% prior

* Raised expected 2023 unemployment rate to 4.6% from 4.4% prior

* Raised expected 2023 inflation (core PCE) to 3.5% from 3.1% prior

* Lowered 2023 GDP growth to 0.50% from 1.2% prior

&gt; Note that the Fed has raised the terminal rate every chance they got this year and the current dot plot is supportive of further increases in 2023. In addition, they see ongoing rate hike increases as appropriate, but could see a stepdown to 25bps in future meetings. The Fed also reiterated their higher for longer stance.

**From the 2:30 PM EST Q&amp;A session (highlight points):**

* Reiterated countless times over and over that history has set a precedent in which financial conditions being loosened too soon has resulted in resurging inflation. Higher for longer was brought up many many times.

* Economic pain cannot be avoided in the path to restoring price stability. The costs of not restoring price stability will far outweigh any near term economic pain. 

* Expressed extremely clearly that they are devoted to the goal of a sustainable 2% inflation. Absolutely no consideration on 3% or 4%. 

* Current projections do not see any rate cuts in 2023. 

* The biggest problem in tacking inflation is services/labor. Services/labor remain too tight, are less sensitive to interest rate changes, and make up over 50% of inflation statistics. 

* Path to soft landing continues to narrow, but will not discuss 'hypotheticals' such as stagflation. Hesitant to address a soft landing question and answers regarding a soft landing were much weaker than in previous sessions.

* Happy to see weak inflation prints over the last two months, but will need to see significantly more definitive proof that inflation on its way lower to a sustainable 2%.

My understanding is that even earnings contraction to a historically semi-normal level ($200 per share for SP500) at a 17x PE would only bring us slightly below the lows of this year.   Would be a drop from where we are, but not crippling.  Any form of recession would also possibly push the Fed closer to a pause, then pivot?  The “higher for longer” rhetoric from Jerome Powell seems to signal that they’re willing to allow a bit of pain, but at this point who believes the Fed?  What are the odds a “financial accident” occurs and really hits the economy?  Which brings me to my next point..

In a deeper recession, could we see a bit more PE contraction (say 15-16x) and SP500 EPS drop to $175?  What evidence is there for a deep recession vs. a mild recession?  Household debt levels, layoffs, past due mortgage rates, etc?  Which area seems like the last straw?

personalfinance,Is it worth spending 30-35% of our income on rent for our first apartment?,"A little background first. My SO and I (early 30s) are moving out in the spring. We’ve been living at home our whole lives and have saved up and paid off a majority of our debt but now we’re ready and financially stable enough to move out. Our only debt is about 20k federal student loans which we haven’t touched in years because of the freeze. We’re also getting married in a couple of years and expect to spend about 20k overall. Our plan is to rent for 2-3 years and then buy some property after the wedding. We also live outside of the NYC area which has a fairly HCOL. 

I work a stable job and will earn a base of $90,000 next year with at least $2,000 additional in per diem guaranteed. I expect to per diem to be anywhere from $10,000-15,000 depending on travel requirements plus another potential $10,000-15,000 overtime also depending on travel requirements. 

Base = 90K
Per diem = 10-15K (tax free/not income)
OT = 10-15K
Bonus = 2-3K (not guaranteed)
Income with extras = 110-120K+

My SO also works a fairly stable job and will earn about 35K with no OT and rarely any bonuses. 

Income gross base: 90K + 35K = 125K
Income gross w/ extras: 125K+25K = ~150K

Going by the rule of 30% of gross pay at a base income of 125K, we can afford rent at just over $3,000 a month. At $3,000, we have a decent number of options in the town(s) we’re looking to rent in. If we were to increase that to 35%, our maximum rent would be roughly $3,450. Going with 30% of our estimated final income of 150K, our maximum rent could be $3,750 or $300 higher than the 35% rent based on the 125K income. 

Our goal is not to hit our maximum rent threshold as much as possible but renting a newer and nicer apartment is preferred over some of the more affordable yet older and more run down apartments. What thoughts and advice can you all share?",finance,1671079885

personalfinance,Should I buy another house?,"My wife (31) and I (31) bought a 3-bedroom apartment in Cape Town, South Africa for $196K, in Sept. We set up the apartment as an Airbnb but we recently found out that the body corporate is against short-term rental even if there is no rule set out against short-term rental. We are in the process of challenging their nonexistent rules and hopefully, we will win the vote and be allowed to carry on with our Airbnb. Our Airbnb has an expected annual return of $22K. Otherwise, a long-term rental will have a return of $139K. 

We took out a loan of $145K with a steep interest rate of 9.9%. In the last 3 months, we manage to reduce the loan to $87K. With the expected revenue from Airbnb or long-term rental, we should be able to repay the loan in under 5 years. 

We recently found a small one-bedroom house in an up-and-coming area with an asking price of $81K. If we decide to Airbnb that place too, the expected annual return would be $10K.  We are in a position to do a cash offer on the house. Our reasoning is that both the revenue from the house and the apartment can help repay the loan faster and save on the high-interest rate.

personalfinance,Does it ever make sense to purchase a house here?,"Alongside many other house-related posts, I wanted to know if it ever makes sense to buy a house here in Switzerland. More specifically, in or around the city of Zurich.

Now, of course Zurich is one of the most expensive places to purchase housing, but beyond that the laws on funding here are different to most other places, and I think this alters the affordability, or indeed even the justifications to buy a place. I want to try and get others opinions if this is the case.

In short, the rules state that the maximum mortgage one can get is such that, at a 5% interest rate, your interest payments do not exceed 1/3 of your gross salary. Meaning if you individually, or as a couple make 150k, your annual interest fees cannot exceed 50k if the interest rate is 5%. Your maximum allowed mortgage is then 1m.

In addition, though, you must pay in cash at least 20% of the value of the home as well. Half of this can come from the pension fund, though.

Mortgages here also often indefinite. There are some rules stating that you must pay 15% of the principal in the first 15 years, but other than this you can define fixed-term mortgages for between generally 2-15 years, after which you renew.

Now to the practicalities with all this in mind. To take my current situation to be representative may be anecdotal, but lets say it is for now. I am currently in a 3 bedroom 115m2 apartment in a decent area just outside the main city. I am renting and currently pay CHF4k a month with my partner + utilities.

If I were to purchase this very apartment it would likely cost somewhere between CHF1.8-2m from other apartments being sold in this block. If we take the more conservative number here, and assume my partner and I can afford the maximum mortgage allowable, we would still need to pay CHF360k from our savings or pension. This is a crazy amount of money to me.

In addition, though, I now have the pleasure of a mortgage now worth CHF1.44m. For the sake of argument interest rates are now about 2% for a 2 year mortgage if you are being optimistic. This comes to CHF28,800 per year in interest payments alone. Repair and ancillary costs are generally assumed to be 1% of the value of the place. Lets again be generous and round that down to CHF15,000. This now comes to around about CHF43,000 a year again round down a bit. 

As things stand, therefore, I currently pay CHF48k a year to live in a place that would cost me 43K if I owned it. This coupled with the opportunity costs of the massive downpayment I made, and the lack of flexibility if I end up with crappy neighbours (as has already happened) to me makes it seem like it's not even worth buying a place. Most places I see now are extraordinarily expensive, and particularly disappointing too. Surely I am missing something here?

If you have the right degree path and are open to working for the least hated Department in the Federal government, then consider throwing your hat in the ring and applying to one of the open announcements.

personalfinance,High Interest Savings and CDs,"Hey everyone, first time poster here. So what are everyone's thoughts on high interest rate CDs and savings? 

25% of savings went into 18 month CD @ 4.1% interest

25% of savings went into 12 month CD @ 4% interest

50% of savings in standard savings account @ 3%

I can afford to put 25% into another CD, but is that ideal? I don't plan on using that money for another year but do we expect CD interest rates to drop or increase? Am I missing free money here?",finance,1671111266

# [Stock futures fall a second day on fears the Fed will tip the economy into a recession](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/14/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were sharply lower Thursday following the Federal Reserve’s latest policy update, as investors worried the central bank could tip the economy into a recession as it continues its fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 350 points, or 1.05%. S&amp;P 500 futures dropped 1.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures lost 1.59%.
*****
&gt; Tesla shares fell more than 2% in the premarket after CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his stake in the company.
*****
&gt; Treasury yields declined following the most recent Fed rate hike, with the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note falling below 3.5%.
*****
&gt; Those moves follow a down session Wednesday when the Dow fell 142 points, while the S&amp;P 500 declined 0.61% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 0.76%.
*****
&gt; Investors digested the Federal Reserve’s latest comments following a boost to its overnight borrowing rate. The central bank said it will continue hiking rates through 2023 and projected a higher-than-expected terminal rate of 5.1%. With Wednesday’s half a percentage point hike, the targeted range for rates is currently 4.25% to 4.5%, which is the highest in 15 years.
*****
&gt; “Overall, we expected to hear Chair Powell emphasize that the ‘hard part’ of returning inflation to 2.0% is just beginning. We largely received that message,” Bank of America’s Michael Gapen wrote in a Wednesday note.
*****
&gt; “The Fed remains willing to risk a recession in the labor market in order to bring inflation down and, if anything, the December projections suggest that risk has risen, not diminished. We agree and continue to look for a recession in 1H 2023 and a sharper rise in the unemployment rate than the median FOMC member projects,” Gapen added.
*****
&gt; Despite favorable improvements like modest growth, spending and production, Powell indicated he remains concerned job gains are too robust and the unemployment rate is too good for the Fed’s fight against inflation.
*****
&gt; Investors will get another batch of economic data to digest Thursday. Retail sales, jobless claims and Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index are all due out at 8:30 a.m. ET.

A) Keep our current home and rent it out at $1,400 per month.

B) Sell our current home.

We owe $152,000 on our current home and it is valued at around $208,000.

Additionally, the thought came across my mind to talk to our current lender about selling the current home and working out a better interest rate on the new home. We currently have $152,000 of their money at 2.5% rate. Would they consider something like a 4.5% rate on a new home if we agreed to sell the current home? Has anyone attempted this or had any luck?

but i don't get the overnight lending rate (except that that affects how high interest rates are on loans from commercial lenders and that it affects ""liquidity"" in the market?). or how the treasury and the fed affect each other or if the fed is the ""driver"" in all cases?
then i also don't understand how bond yields (which i guess is the number i should be looking at) are or are not affected by the fed raising or lowering interest rates.
then the other one is whether falling yields implies rising stock prices and vice versa.

I had to borrow a lot from my siblings and my credit cards are maxed out because I used them to pay bills and to pretty much survive. 

Now that I have some flexibility for the next few weeks before I have to take my winter course, I was thinking of working and trying to pay stuff off. 

My bills are also unfortunately overdue as well and it’s so overwhelming. I don’t know where to start. 

I start working as a behavior tech in a few weeks and while it is part-time, the pay is decent ($18.25 hourly) 

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated. 

If more information is needed, please let me know!

Credit cards 
Credit One: $508*; 23.99% interest rate 
Capital One: $339*; I couldn’t find this interest rate
Cable: $391.00*
Rent: $475.00; but this isn’t overdue 
Light: $130.00*
Phone: $130.00*

The stars indicate overdue, these are all I could think of at the moment! 🥺

Edit 2: After going through your comments, the main takeaway is being more specific. I’ll try my best. 

My main area is to control my debt, the credit cards should have only been used for emergencies but that wasn’t the case. I would also like to have some money put away so I don’t have to rely on my cards. It is hard to calculate any incoming income because I do a lot of side gigs and none of them are consistent. 

I also want to try to knock out the overdue bills so none of my stuff becomes cut off. Maybe a payment arrangement or an IOU might help? 

Also I forgot to mention that I am moving on campus in a few weeks, but I still have to help with my expenses at home because my mother is on a very fixed income.

From what I've read, the market is forecasting a fed rates peak in may and then a decrease in the second semester.

So the idea would be to buy ETFs with 25% of my cash reserve every quarter of 2023. I would aim for the bloodiest days by monitoring the RSI or something similar. 

There is no specific reason why I think that the bottom will occur somewhere in 2023 but when I compare to 2008 or the dot com crash, 2 years is something I believe as a long period for a crash.

My thesis is that all  these assumptions are overly optimistic due to inflation becoming  entrenched in labor, housing, excess money supply, and supply chain  issues. Also, that as a results rates will have to go higher and remain  elevated for a longer period (through 2023, so no rate cuts), and that  we are facing a moderate to severe recession in 2023 (no soft landing).  Granted, only one of these assumptions would have to break to adversely  affect the market. My sources include historical data on inflation  trends, earnings forecasts for 2023, the recent inflation report, and  the track record of the Fed.

“Progressive” is really an umbrella term that lumps together many left-leaning political ideologies under a set of demands that we *deem* to be inalienable rights of any human. These are education, healthcare, a living wage and housing. It is true that progressives do put demands on the government to protect and nurture these allegedly inalienable rights. However, you shouldn’t believe that progressives and the left are defenders of the state simply because they demand better of it.

In practice, progressives do their best work when they are not focused on electoral politics. At the local level, progressives focus on mutual aid, trade unions and grassroots organizing. These stem from the revolutionary anarchist tradition which came about due to horrific working conditions during the early centuries of capitalism.

The 19th century revolutionary anarchist’s goal was the absolute dissolution of the state by any means necessary. Anarchists despised the state with a passion that went beyond anything Murray Rothbard could have expressed. Anarchists of the time engaged in guerrilla warfare and many died trying to destroy the state (Rothbard lived out his life comfortably under the state, I might add). Progressives may not be trying to blow up the state these days, but they put major emphasis on providing for communities without help from the government.

Many assume that since Bitcoin inherently protects the right to property and individual ownership that it must be ideologically opposed to the beliefs of progressives. Actually, progressives aren’t opposed to owning things, in general. What it boils down to is rent, interest and democratic enterprises. What progressives really want are rent-free economies.

In fact, if you go back to the 19th century classical economic discussions of a free market, that’s what people like Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, Karl Marx, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, David Ricardo and others were trying to figure out. So, owning bitcoin is not in opposition to progressivism. Progressives are not inherently opposed to money, just opposed to how it is used as a means of control and power. Progressives and Bitcoiners are in opposition to neoliberalism because, among other problems that it created, neoliberalism is upheld through state violence.

As for exclusive individual ownership in Bitcoin, that is just a misunderstanding of Bitcoin. Bitcoiners are very proud of El Zonte, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Beach experiment. It’s hailed as a model for a successful circular economy based on Bitcoin. Here, the developers of the Bitcoin Beach wallet realized that locals would benefit from a community-based custodial option. In this case, the wallet makes it possible to designate a trusted member of the community to be the holder of the private keys for other people’s wallets. Here, responsibility is now coupled with community-based trust, not individual responsibility.

The idea of individual responsibility is one that is unique to the West and more so to the United States. Community identity is much more important in other parts of the world. Since Bitcoin has done so well in many developing nations where community is more valuable than individuality, it is hard to believe that Bitcoin is truly only for those concerned with strict individualism.

Another interesting community-owned idea in Bitcoin is the federated mint ([FediMint](https://fedimint.org/)). Here, a community with a certain amount of trust among its members, can effectively co-own the mint. This leads to a whole set of new ideas about community-based currencies that are backed by Bitcoin, that remind me a bit of Paul Grignon’s ideas about self-issued credit but also of Prodhoun’s concept of a People’s Bank, both coupled with John Nash’s work on ideal money. There is so much here that appeals to the progressive!

The only real part about Bitcoin that seems ideologically opposed to progressives at the moment is the 21 million bitcoin cap. The main reason is that there are economic leaders in the movement who are followers of John Maynard Keynes. This stems likely from the Keynesian critique of neoclassical economics and the argument that markets do not tend toward full employment, among other things.

Some of the desire for post-Keynesian approaches may be nostalgia for that long-dead constrained era of capitalism during the post-WWII period. Some of it is a seemingly pragmatic approach to softening boom-bust cycles, in which Keynes argued that deficit spending should occur during economic crises and be constrained during surpluses. Hyman Minsky, another pillar of economics for progressives, attempted to unite Joseph Schumpeter (Austrian school) and Keynes to understand how to stabilize an unstable economy. By the way, this [unification](https://www.amazon.com/Barnes-Noble-Routledge-Classics-set/dp/1138641952%5C) (written in the early 1980s) provided a prophetic prediction of the Great Recession.

Even though there seems to be contradiction here between Keynesian ideas and Bitcoin’s monetary policy, some of the most progressively-aligned economists, like Michael Hudson and Steve Keen, regularly appear on Max Keiser’s “Keiser Report” for their sharp critiques of the banking system, dollar hegemony, quantitative easing, and neoclassical economics. Are you surprised? Progressive economists get it, they just aren’t convinced that the existing system can operate under a capped monetary policy. This is the problem in understanding, really. What Bitcoiners are really advocating for is a new system altogether.

Today, [modern monetary theory](https://www.investopedia.com/modern-monetary-theory-mmt-4588060) (MMT) has taken hold of the progressive movement because it also centers the idea of a full employment guarantee where the government backstops the private sector employment with non-competitive jobs. MMT advocates also believe that they can control the money supply and inflation through fiscal and monetary policy. They argue that by bringing full productive forces online (no more, no less) that inflation can be properly managed. However, it has never been tried; the Federal Reserve Board does not practice real MMT at this time. To be clear, even MMT advocates are critical of quantitative easing.

This is not to say that the left gives a full-throated endorsement of MMT, either. There are plenty of critiques of MMT from the left, all one has to do is look for them. Even so, Bitcoin is still appealing to a progressive even if they are MMT supporters simply because of the concerns over the goodness of their money over time. All one really needs to do is explain to the progressive how inflation decoupled from adjustments in living wage is a silent killer of their paycheck. What’s the alternative? Save some of that purchasing power over the long term by “hodling” bitcoin, of course.

Progressives are well aware of the damage the Federal Reserve and the government did during the Great Recession. Progressives supported Occupy Wall Street because many of them lost their homes to illegal foreclosures. Progressives need to be reminded, though, that the ivory towers of central banks are not any more our friends than the mega-corporation banks are. We can do better to educate our fellow progressives on money as a technology and on the idea that we can have a different economic system where a 21 million cap works.

To stimulate this idea of a different economic system, let’s pull from the degrowth movement. Degrowth encompasses a lot of ideas, but the main one is that our economic system should be tied to our planet’s ability to sustain life. Given the ease at which the banking system generates money (has anyone else compared the S&amp;P 500 chart to the climate change hockey stick chart?), and the obvious trends that as our Gross Domestic Product has gone up, so have our carbon emissions, it seems entirely logical that we should have a cap somewhere.

In the degrowth literature, there have been discussions about tying a currency to the amount of energy produced. Bitcoin’s network is backed by access to energy resources. Its mining protocol scales based on the price of electricity. It also has the ability to bring online wasted and stranded energy. This means that the network grows with a speed limit. We can plan whole economies around this prospect.

Furthermore, Bitcoin disintermediates the banking system and puts banking not only in the hands of the individual but of communities (something that Occupy Wall Street advocated for). Communities and/or cooperatives (like in the [autonomous people’s economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_Administration_of_North_and_East_Syria) in Rojava) can issue their own community-backed loans using bitcoin as the backing. There’s much to be explored here and progressives (and leftists more broadly) can really lead the way.

The reality is not that Bitcoin needs to be rebranded to fit a progressive narrative. It is that Bitcoiners – and non-Bitcoiners alike – need to realize that while the network’s genesis block was a political attack on the central banking system, that this sentiment is not exclusive to American libertarianism. This is why progressives are in the Bitcoin space, because we know that Bitcoin is for everyone, and we’re going to make sure that everyone, not just Libertarians, know that there is a way to exit the system and that Bitcoin can help us find the way out.

hardware,Is the root cause of CPU bottlenecking the GeForce 4090 Nvidia's software scheduler?,"Traditionally, (my understanding) of a CPU bottleneck (with respect to a GPU) is the inability to feed the GPU frame data quickly enough, effectively handicapping the GPU and producing a lot of frametime variance and stuttering.

The subject of the 4090 being CPU limited is recurring on this and other subs, with some arguing that it's (traditional, as mentioned above) CPU bottlenecking, but I'm under the impression that it's not traditional CPU bottlenecking, but instead a result of Nvidia's software scheduler.

I reached this conclusion because others are citing examples where the 7900 XTX is outperforming the 4090, but logically, **if the CPU was the bottleneck, the 7900 XTX wouldn't be able to achieve greater FPS with the same CPU**, right?

So the explanation I've reached is that the 4090 needs a powerful CPU to drive both the game and it's scheduler concurrently, and the weaker the CPU, the greater the overall detriment to performance. This is following the discovery presented by Hardware Unboxed in their two-part series on Nvidia's driver overhead [here](https://youtu.be/JLEIJhunaW8) and [here (part 2](https://youtu.be/JLEIJhunaW8)).

In discussion, others have posited that it is not related to Nvidia's scheduler, but instead that the CPU is not able to feed frame data to the 4090 quickly enough, resulting in the 4090 idling and/or downclocking, which then (presumably) incurs a lag penalty whilst resuming. This explanation doesn't make sense to me, because in the comparison, a 7900 XTX is able to produce more FPS, which implies it's being fed more frame data quickly enough.

**Questions:**

1. What is the root cause of CPU bottlenecking the 4090, specifically, when we're comparing against a 7900 XTX, and the results show a 7900 XTX achieving higher FPS?
2. If the bottleneck is Nvidia's scheduler, which CPUs are effectively *not* bottlenecking the 4090, if any? Similarly, how is the 4080 affected, and at what CPU level is/isn't a 4080 affected?
3. If the bottleneck is not Nvidia's scheduler, can you explain what the bottleneck is, and why it's seemingly affecting the 4090, but not the 7900 XTX, in the same way?",technology,1671154683

personalfinance,What's the NACA black magic?,"There's this non-profit org called NACA, which upon joining gains you access to some black magic for First Time Home Buyers:

- No down payment
- No closing costs
- Below-market interest rates
- No private mortgage insurance (PMI)

NACA is not a mortgage lender and thus has to be subject to mortgage rates on the open market, so what do they exactly do to be able to provide the above?

Are they just putting down a certain assistance amount for their members and delaying repayment of that assistance until a certain milestone?

The best case scenario I could come up with is that they put a lien on the house for the amount of the assistance they provide - but on a 30+ year horizon, why would they even do that or is there some contractual obligation to settle the lien by a certain deadline (say over 5-10 years) etc?

I know their best programs are income and area restricted - but I still want to know the backend mechanisms they employ

I don't care if their underwriting is slow or they employ volunteers for everything or are disorganized or pray to Satan - I am interested to know how exactly - the actual actions/steps they take to offer these advantages and why a person who's not associated with NACA, can't manage to replicate the exact same things if only they knew what those magical steps are

personalfinance,Should I pay off my car?,"So over the past few years I've had my ups and downs, but I've stuck to a pretty strict regimen for improving my credit outside of a particular rough few months. I'm now at a place where I'm making significantly more than I need for my monthly budget and I've paid down all my debt, barring my monthly car payment.

I bought the car at the beginning of caring for my credit. Never missed a payment, etc, but my interest rate is ridiculous because I had no money down and a poor credit score at purchase. My credit score now is low-mid 700s and with this paycheck I can now pay off the rest of the loan this month (roughly half of what I financed overall).

My question is: given that I hope to be getting a home loan in the next few years, I don't want to make what seems like the no-brainer decision of freeing up hundreds of dollars a month if it will hurt my credit outlook with banks. Other than my car, I only have two credit cards that I've gotten in the last 3 years (again no late payments. I don't even hold a balance on them).

Would it be better for me to knock out the car payment and save toward a down-payment, or to refinance and get out of the crazy interest rate so I maintain my credit age and open lines of credit?",finance,1671160952

I often hear that higher rates are good for workers because it cools down the housing market by decreasing the demand for credit. Additionally, higher rates is claimed to increase the value of income as income no longer has to compete with cheap credit. 

However, on the flip side, I hear the high rates slows down borrowing and grinds the economy to a halt. Thus, higher interest rates result in unemployment and wage stagnation.

- $7k remaining student loans, currently being paid off by my company at $250/mo, and eligible to be forgiven by the fed govt. The only reason I haven't completely paid these off on my own so far is because the government might, and my company will if I give them enough time.

ethereum,Why ETH will be labeled a security very soon…,"People can argue day and night that Ethereum does not pass the Howey test, and therefore, is not a security.

However, these people have failed to look at the bigger picture. Namely, the consequences for the government if they were to deem ETH as a commodity.

First, they would get sued by virtually every single crypto project in existence which does get labeled a security. Will the government be able to justify in court why ETH was given a special carve out?

Second, by labeling ETH as a commodity, they will have essentially ended the concept of a ""company"". They will have provided a blueprint on how any new venture can simply create a blockchain, follow Ethereums tokenomics, and avoid being labeled a security.

By following this ""ethereum standard"", everything going forward will be an unregulated commodity. In fact, I can imagine a scenario where established companies dissolve themselves and re-form again using the ""ethereum standard"" specifically so they can delist as a security and be an unregulated commodity. Google will be a commodity. Facebook will be a commodity. Everything will be a commodity.

Does anyone really believe the government is going to allow that? If so, I would argue that you are being intellectually dishonest and your opinion is driven by pure hopium which has been fed to you by ETH maxis who are incapable of seeing the bigger picture.

So... for those of you thinking that XRP is going to win their case... keep dreaming. The SEC cannot afford to lose and they will not lose. The XRP case is what they will use as precedent to label all cryptos that had a pre-mine or VC backers to be labeled a security.

personalfinance,Do I have too much money in savings?,"Hi guys, I’m in a pretty particular situation here, so hopefully no judgement. Just looking for some insight. I’m almost 26 years old. Single, no kids, and still living at home. I have a stable career and gross on average around $125k a year. Base salary is only 105K, but with bonuses and overtime I am pretty much guaranteed to range from 120 to 140k. However, I am still trying to base my finances as if I make much less so that I can continue saving for an early retirement, but also so that I can enjoy my life now. My 401k is maxed, along with my HSA and Roth IRA. I have minimal bills living at home so obviously saving hasn’t been an issue. I have had this job for about 4 years now but I’ve put off buying my first house due to a couple of reasons, mainly the pandemic and 2 back to back hurricanes in 2020 that really screwed the market up locally. I am hoping, (but not 100% certain) that I’ll be buying my first house within the next year. However, the market seems to be pretty high still. People keep saying it will come down but it’s been very minimal so far, and now of course interest rates are up. A lot of people tell me just to keep doing what I’m doing and save while I can. But, I feel like it’s getting close to time. 

So, long story short. I currently have a bit over $100k in a HYS account, and it really bothers me knowing that as time goes on and that money just sits there it loses value like crazy. So… I really don’t know what I should do with it? Ever since I hit $100k in my HYS a few months ago, I’ve been dumping my excess money into the market instead, of course it’s only dropped here lately but I’m confident it will go up long term. 

So how much money should I keep in my savings while saving for a house? And what about after I buy a house? For now, should I keep the full $100k until I buy? Should I continue adding to it? Do I have too much and should I take a some out and invest it in index funds and such now? 

I guess another question to go along with this would be… How much should I be looking to put down on a 200-250k house? I’d definitely do a minimum of 20%, but would it be in my best interest to put more than that down? With interest rates at 6 to 7% currently, putting more down does seem like a safe bet. But being a first time home buyer, I would also like to have a bit extra of a money cushion as I adjust, as making the money I do with very little bills to having to pay at least half of my monthly salary in a mortgage and other associated bills is going to be a huge change for me. 

Open to any advice or suggestions. Thanks.",finance,1671180556

Obviously there are other factors with technology and the economy  changing etc.  But did the 2008 onward low rates change everything about the way companies grow and how people invest? 

Can we ever go back to an economy / investing climate where 5% is a low rate and we aren’t getting 300-400% gains a decade in the major indexes? 

If not, are we just doomed to run through these boom and bust cycles where every generation gets lucky or set back?",finance,1671184005

1) pay for child support (he just got fired so no income)
2) pay off some of his 40k worth of debt (mostly CC, one car his ex took with her but is still under his name...)
3) to put 1k down to restructure(?) on his house so that it doesn't get foreclosed before the sale.

With all that debt, it doesn't sound wise to take out money from his 401k. Right now, he's banking on the house selling soon, which should well exceed the amount he has in his 401k.

I recall you can borrow against your 401k, but I thought that was limited to certain things, and I don't recall whether there is an interest rate. As well, what are the repercussions of not paying back your 401k (which I think allows 5 years to pay back?)

We're looking for advice. There is a lot to unpack, so please feel free to comment on borrowing against one's own 401k or anything else that's been mentioned.

My credit score is about 670, monthly income from paychecks 2200ish, and income from tips (I work at a bar) at about 400-500 a week.

personalfinance,Got a new job. What do I do with old retirement plan,"I recently got a new job and will be transitioning from a city government job into a federal government job.

My new job will have a pension as well as a federal thrift savings plan (401k kind of from my understanding)

My question is, what can I do with the 52.5k and 30k respectively. Can I somehow roll them into an IRA without taking a massive penalty? Can I roll them into a Roth IRA somehow? I'd prefer not to have to contribute to a pension and my new retirement plan and also have a 3rd fund just sitting there without as much contribution.",finance,1671197399
personalfinance,"Is there any reason not to max out 401k contributions (actual max, not the max your company matches) if you can afford it, and have all other debt paid off, aside from mortgage?","I'm going to start a new job which is giving me a roughly 40% pay increase: going from 95k to 135k. I currently contribute 6% to my 401k (roughly 6k a year) to get the full match, and I think it's time to max out my 401k contributions to get my retirement growing as fast as possible.

I have around 75k in retirement funds at the age of 36, and a 30k emergency fund. I put a good deal of money away each month in HSA (300), 529 (2 kids - 100 each), and a savings account I use for either sudden necessities or treats (200); I'm going to bump up the 529 savings and lower the HSA, I just had the 2nd kid which wiped out my HSA, so I'm rebuilding. This leaves me around breaking even each month after paying bills and living comfortably. I have two IRAs I contribute too as well, with extra cash, but I don't always max them out.

My wife doesn't like the idea of maxing out the 401k, as the money is locked up, but I don't see any reason not to do it. She makes the point that our house needs improvements, nothing that is a problem now, but some major projects coming down the pipe: new roof (it should have 10 years left, but looks rough, so probably needs replaced sooner), new floors, new deck, and we'd like to remodel the kitchen. She's not wrong that we need to do these things, but none of them are a pressing concern, and we will still have around an extra 25k each year after I max out the 401k; probably a good deal less after taxes, but still a huge chunk of money for projects.

So, my questions are:

* Is there any reason I shouldn't max out my 401k? The only other thing I feel like I need to put more money towards is my kids 529, but I know my retirement should come before that, and I'm probably going to bump my contributions to that up a good bit anyway.
* Where should I put my money that I want to use towards home improvement projects? I have a savings account, but the interest rate is a joke. Is there any other place to park your money that you plan to access about once a year for big projects?",finance,1671198622

bonds,"Fidelity 3 month CD 4.35%, what are my risks?","Looking at the fixed income research portal in fidelity, I see the following.  Right at the top for shortest duration are 3 month CD's for 4.35%.  What are my downsides to this?

\-My belief is that the equities market is going to continue its downtrend for the next 6-12 months and (hopefully) bottom around 3200-3500 which is potentially another 15% loss in capital.  I have taken some profits from the last upswing in the markets and want to reinvest that cash rather than losing to inflation.

\-3 months at 4.35% is certainly not beating inflation, but its better than equity downside risk.  Even investing in dividend paying stocks still has significant equity downside risk.

\-The fed might might continue past terminal funds rate if needed, but as long as I do not sell the CD early, there is no loss in principal.

\-Sure I could invest in a broad bond fund, and potentially get an increase in bond value worth more than 4.35% if bond prices continue to rise. It seems that the bond market already priced in the bottom a few months ago, but if the fed goes past 5% then that might have been a false bottom and those funds trade sideways for a little while longer until we get further clarity about the future.  (no one knows, but my point with this example is that there is more risk)

\-To me it seems that this is a no brainer and better than cash, unless we have some sort of major equities rally, or a bond fund rally that I miss out on those gains instead.  But 3 months is not a long lockup time in the grand scheme of things.  However whenever something seems like a ""no brainer"" that usually means I am not understanding something in entirety. As you can see in my other posts, I am new to bonds. And while I am not trying to time the market, I am trying to do some rebalancing.

\-Also why would I choose a 6 month at 4.6% which is marginally better than 3 month at 4.35%?  With a 3 month I could potentially buy another 3 month CD once it matures and I get my cash back+ interest.  Unless we have a sudden rate decrease (unlikely) I can just purchase a new 3 month.  For the sake of this example lets call it 4% at that point in time.  I could buy 3 months at 4.35 and then buy another 3 months at 4% and get significantly more than buy a 6 month now at 4.6%.  Yes I know that the interest is taxable and such, but am i misunderstanding something?

stocks,How we could be wrong (Morgan Stanley GIC),"The latest GIC report from Morgan Stanley, published Dec 12, 2022: [https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf)

The first paragraph lays out MS' current thinking and positioning:

""Recent US equity resilience has been based largely on a belief that the Federal Reserve will execute a soft landing in 2023, forestalling the current bear market. That view has been expressed in a consensus 2023 S&amp;P 500 earnings per share (EPS) projection of $230, which contrasts with our $195 forecast that assumes nonrecessionary profit declines amid lower corporate pricing power and sales volumes. One way we could be wrong is if cost cutting proves historically effective, but that would likely take a toll on consumption and employment, accelerating an economic slowdown. While such a scenario would prompt the Fed to cut rates, it would likely increase recession odds. Alternatively, labor market strength and consumer spending could surprise to the upside, helping to sustain profits. In such a scenario, however, risks around “higher for longer” fed funds rise, resulting in a threat to equity prices from lower valuation multiples, rather than weaker earnings. There are always three ways to be wrong about the market: by misjudging multiples, earnings or both. With uncertainty around those variables historically high, we prefer to harvest risk premium for the privilege of waiting. Consider tax-loss harvesting— especially passive index positions—and investing proceeds in yieldproducing assets like Treasuries, municipals, corporates, MLPs, residential REITs, and value-oriented and high-dividend equities.""

&amp;#x200B;

The chart of the week is fascinating and reflects the tremendous uncertainty:  ""The divergence in S&amp;P 500 price targets from market strategists has only been this wide once in the last 15 years."" The chart shows a spread of \~32% which is just below the peak from 2009 \~33%.

&amp;#x200B;

Obviously the focus is on the Fed: ""We have noted that the peak fed funds rate has historically occurred when the Federal Reserve has managed to raise the policy rate above its preferred measure of inflation—the core Personal Consumption Expenditures Index (PCE). With core PCE still running at just over 5%, even next week’s anticipated 50-basis-point hike suggests the Fed has more work to do. The fed funds futures curve agrees and is pricing two more 25-basis point hikes between January and May 2023.""",finance,1671212427

*"" The Bridgewater co-chief investment officer said the shutdowns in China have been a “blessing” for the rest of the world by slowing the second-largest economy.*

*“It’s been such a disinflationary force into a global inflation,” he said on Bloomberg TV Thursday. “China opening and the effect that’s going to have on commodity prices, in competing for raw materials in the world, while the US and Europe are entering recession, will probably make the central banking dilemma worse.”*

And he isn't wrong. For the first 10 months of 2022 China crude demand was down an average-1.8 million barrel/day. While China crude demand was down, its refineries were still operating, thus creating artificial new supply in processed fuels like diesel and kerosene. This is reflected in other commodities like palm oil where China is the second largest importer (imports fell by 44% year-on-year), and LNG. The LNG situation is pretty interesting, China is the largest LNG importer, and demand is set to fall 1% this year. They are not participating in the LNG spot market this winter which is good news for Europe which basically gets all their lng right now from the spot market. 

Either way, its a pretty safe assumption that any supply chain smoothing out that ending zero covid brings will be canceled out by China's dramatic return to the global commodity markets. The recent  December Politburo meeting should have you a little more worried too. For the first time ever "" 扩大内需 "" ( means expanding domestic demand) was emphasized more then the traditional supply side investment rhetoric. The readout also mentions "" *We should focus on expanding domestic demand and give full play to the foundational role of consumption and the key role of investment.* "" In my view this means that western style stimulus checks are an idea China's legislators are considering (source here in Chinese  [http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-12/07/c\_1129188720.htm](http://www.news.cn/politics/leaders/2022-12/07/c_1129188720.htm)) 

Either way a recovering Chinese economy, particularly if the recovery comes very fast, will put a lot of pressure on central banks. Important to remember that 54% of China's GDP comes from domestic consumption compared to 27% from manufacturing.  It will definitely increase the period of rate hikes needed to get to the Fed's desired inflation number.",finance,1671215793

stocks,Ending the week with Quadruple Witching,"End of Week Re-cap

* Markets Down Following Fed Announcement
* Yield Curve Inversion Taking a Toll
* Disappointing Retail Report
* Quadruple Witching

Major market indices are down on the week, most of those losses coming in the wake of Wednesday’s Federal Reserve announcement. Heading into Friday, the S&amp;P 500 is off 2.5%, Nasdaq Composite is off 3.2% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average has lost just over 2%. With today being a quadruple witching day, there is certainly a possibility for it to be another volatile day.

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve announced a half point increase in short term lending rates. While markets were largely expecting that, the news that followed sent stocks lower. Although the Fed anticipates less aggressive rate hikes moving forward, their target level of 5 – 5.5% is slightly higher than many expected. The Fed also expects to reach that level in 2023 and hold rates their until 2024. That news dashed hopes that the Fed would begin easing sometime in 2023.

Although the Fed is raising shorter term rates, the yield curve remains severely inverted. Yields on 2-year notes are currently around 4.2% while the yield on the 5- year note is 3.61%. Those rates fall even further as you go out in time with 10-year notes yielding just over 3.1%. It probably shouldn’t come as too much of a surprise then that financial stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down 6.5% this month. Financial institutions often lend money out for long durations of time but are forced to borrow over shorter periods. Therefore, lending money at 3% but paying over 4% to borrow is taking its toll.

Yesterday, we received the most recent data on retail sales. November retail sales were down 0.6% compared with October (not adjusted for inflation). That marked the biggest month-over-month drop this year and comes during the all-important holiday shopping season. Auto sales were down sharply which could be a precursor for the housing market.

Finally, today is a quadruple witching. Options on stocks, stock indices, futures and futures options all expire today. The notional amount of options expiring today alone is a massive $4 trillion. December expiration is also commonly considered the last day of liquidity for the year as volumes tend to subside heading into the last couple weeks of the year. 

The VIX is around 23.5 in premarket, well above its historical average. We have already seen the impact of volatility on markets this year. The Nasdaq has recorded 83 days of moves +/-2% which is the most it has seen since 2002 when it notched 84 days. Another volatile day isn’t out of the question, especially with the catalyst of quadruple witching.

Additionally they stated they will be lowering my APR by .999% for the remainder of the loan.

They state they are doing this because of their leap year interest calculation being 365 days instead of 365.25 days by mistake.

I’m trying to make sense of this as it seems like a weird occurrence. I can’t figure out how they came to the $1.53 number for a credit, or why they felt the need to lower my APR?

investing,"Am I naive, or just too optimistic?","See, I don't think the latest interest rate increase is bad news at all.  Consider:

* The Fed has two responsibilities: inflation, and employment.  NOT ""The Markets"".
* Conventional Wisdom: Interest rate adjustments generally take 6-12 months to have their impact.
 * Thus (1) the rate-related effects we see today are the result of last summer's changes, 
 * And (2) this week's easing-off will be felt next spring, not next week.
* MoM inflation IS coming down.  Slowly -- but that's the goal, right? Soft landing?
 * YoY inflation still includes several months of -high- inflation, which are still being counted.
* AND, employment seems to be pretty darn resilient / resistant to this tightening.  That's a good thing -- there are still more job openings than people looking for them.

Taken together, my perhaps-overly-rosy view is that JPow and Friends are doing -exactly- what they're supposed to be doing, and **doing it pretty well**.

Now that the CPUC has voted to finalize the NEM 3 policy and kicked off a 120-day sunset period to be grandfathered into NEM 2.0, I'm assembling a FAQ page here to answer common questions people have been wondering.

Check back for updates. If you don't see an answer to your question, ask it below, and I'll add it here.

So in no particular order, here we go!

What is changing between NEM 2 and NEM 3:

* NEM 2 - Export rates are 1:1 with TOU rates. If rates are 30 cents per kWh in the afternoon, that is the value of NEM credits you get for exporting 1 kWh of power to the grid.
   * NEM 3 - Export rates change hourly with different sets of rates on weekdays and weekends, all of which change monthly. Rates are, on average, 75% lower than NEM2 for PG&amp;E and SCE and 86% lower for SDG&amp;E.
* NEM 2 - Grandfathering lasts for 20 years from PTO and is fully transferable through a sale.
   * NEM 3 - Grandfathering lasts for 9 years for new solar customers. It can only be transferred to a spouse or partner.
* NEM 2 - Required customers to be on any Time of Use (TOU) rate
   * NEM 3 - Requires customers to be on electrification TOU rates: SDG&amp;E EV-TOU-5, SCE TOU-D-PRIME, or PG&amp;E E-ELEC. This is for grid consumption only. Export rates are calculated based on the Avoided Cost Calculator (see below).
* NEMA and vNEM rates will be available on NEM 2 with 9 years of grandfathering after the sunset window is over. The CPUC will be holding a workshop on the future of these rates next year. But they did not have enough data to figure it out just yet.

NEM 2 Grandfathering Questions:

* What is required to be grandfathered into NEM 2?
   * A signed contract, an interconnection application, a diagram, and an oversizing explanation (if oversizing).
* Do I need to be installed to be grandfathered?
   * No, it is based on when your solar company SUBMITS those forms to the utility, free of deficiencies by *April 13.*
* Can I add a battery and not lose my grandfathering?
   * Yes!

General NEM 3 Questions:

* Is there anything I can do to undo the impact of NEM 3?
   * Go solar now. Help others go solar. If you have solar, ensure you don't need an add-on system. Politically we will see what happens over the next few days as the industry prepares to react. There is also a lawsuit against the CPUC that made its way into Federal Court last month regarding the compensation rates for solar from 2011. I've chatted with one of the guys behind it, and his team is looking at a motion to file for an injunction against NEM 3 going through. Don't bank on it, but we will see what happens.
* Will adding solar after April 13 cause me to lose grandfathering?
   * Not if your solar company filed those documents. You have three years to get your system installed.
   * If you didn't get documents filed, you would lose grandfathering if you added a system after the sunset window ends.
   * There was a grandfathering provision that you could add 1 kw or 10% to your system (whichever was larger) without losing NEM 1 grandfathering. They may keep these rules or alter them for NEM 2 grandfathering. The idea was to make it so that a warranty replacement wouldn't end your grandfathering. Most companies will not install only 1-4 panels.
* What about getting an add-on system if I am grandfathered into NEM 1 or 2?
   * You can get an add-on system grandfathered in during the 120 days sunset window. Just make sure the documents are filed in time! Otherwise, you lose grandfathering entirely and will be stuck with NEM 3.
   * It does not reset your grandfathering period, though. It's still 20 years from the PTO for the original system.
   * To reset the clock, you need to remove your original system, cancel your NEM agreement, sign a new NEM agreement, and install a new system.

34M and married and wanted a little bit of help with my finances. I wanted to get your thoughts on what to do next with savings/etc. 

My wife and I bring home about $20,000/month after taxes and 401k contributions as a total household income. We also have a 3 year old son and live in a HCOL area.

We maximize retirement contributions yearly but started late. As a result, as of right now, I don't think I have an adequate amount of savings thus far but hope to make it up. Have right now about $90K for me and about $80K for my wife. 

In addition, I have:

$50,000 in a taxable brokerage account and $35,000 in an emergency fund. 

Here's the problem. Student loans! 

We started off together with about $420,000+ in student loans and we scratched and clawed our way down to $180,000 left to be owed. We have looked into PSLF and other loan forgiveness venues and we aren't really candidates for most, if any of them due to where we work. 

In terms of other expenses, we try and live relatively frugally for the most part but every once in awhile there's a big expense (vacation, etc). 

Consistently, our monthly expenses are as thus:

$3600 monthly mortgage (A lot of my savings went towards the down payment and renovations to the house, but that's all paid off)

$200 utilities 

$180 phone/internet/tv

$2000 daycare

$600 total for two cars 

$400 monthly for housecleaners &amp; emergency babysitter

$1200 monthly for baby's 529 plan

$2500 credit card for various expenses (gas/groceries/going out/etc) 

I have roughly $8000 or so left although as of the last few months I've had certain costly problems with the home; HVAC broken down, water heater broken down (I bought a bit of a fixer upper of a house last year). 

Here are my questions:

With whatever's left, do I keep pouring into loans for now? With a zero percent interest rate I've been debating putting in more money into my brokerage account and buying \*relatively safe\* index funds while they are low. Is that the play or am I an idiot?

Also, how much more should I be putting into my emergency fund? Is $35K adequate?

Definitely know I need to budget my cc expenses better. I appreciate you all.",finance,1671227640

*****
&gt; Stocks dropped Friday, building on their year-end sell-off, as fears grow over a recession taking place as the Federal Reserve continues raising rates.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 281.76 points, or 0.85%, to 32,920.46. The S&amp;P 500 fell 1.11% to 3,852.36. Meanwhile, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined 0.97% to 10,705.41.
*****
&gt; The indexes notched a second consecutive week of losses. The S&amp;P 500 fell 2.08% for the week, and putting its December losses at 5.58%, as hopes for a year-end rally fizzle. The Dow and Nasdaq slid 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Trading was especially volatile Friday with a large amount of options expiring. There were $2.6 trillion worth of index options expiring, the highest amount “relative to the size of the equity market in nearly two years,” according to Goldman Sachs. At session lows, the Dow was down as much as 547.63 points, before paring back some of those losses.
*****
&gt; The sell-off was broad-based, with three stocks falling for every advancer at the New York Stock Exchange. At one point, there were only 10 S&amp;P 500 names in positive territory. The real estate and consumer discretionary sectors were the biggest laggards, down nearly 3% and 1.7%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Stocks fell this week in the wake of the Fed’s 50 basis point interest rate hike on Wednesday — the highest rate in 15 years. The central bank said it would continue hiking rates through 2023 to 5.1%, a larger figure than previously expected.
*****
&gt; Following the policy update, the Dow dropped 142 points on Wednesday, plunged 764 points Thursday, and declined further on Friday.
*****
&gt; “At the beginning of the week, we had the hope, given the very soft CPI number, that we could expect the Fed, and maybe the other central banks of the world, to be less hawkish,” Bokeh Capital founder Kim Forrest said.
*****
&gt; “But because they didn’t, and they had some stern words for investors and consumers alike that they were really focused on getting inflation down quickly, that has taken away a lot of our hope for a soft landing,” Forrest added.

&gt; # Santa Claus Rally, Mid-December Low &amp; January Indicator Trifecta

&gt; Wall Street, MSM and social are abuzz with Santa Claus Rally chatter and hype this week, but everyone has it all wrong. I can see Yale’s big grin shining down on us as his famous indicator and catchphrase reverberate on The Street.

&gt; They argue their case for why the “Santa Claus Rally” will or won’t come to town this year. But they miss the point. Yale Hirsch invented and named the Santa Claus Rally in 1972, published in the 1973 Almanac. Oh lord, it is still misunderstood. It’s not a trading strategy, it’s an indicator!

&gt; SCR is the short, sweet rally that runs from the last 5 trading days of the year to the first two trading days of the New Year. S&amp;P 500 posts an average gain of 1.3%. Failure to rally tends to precede bear markets or times when stocks could be purchased at lower prices later in the year.

&gt; To wit Yale’s famous line: “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come To Broad And Wall.” (Stock Trader’s Almanac 2023 p 118).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/c6285b39d656e4d47a2825774f0ebca7/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-a9/s500x750/c2684ec719407200da72d1e590a56cbc11015917.jpg))**

&gt; The current situation is reminiscent of 1974. Midterm October low, December retest. Lots of dire news and conditions. The Fed is clearly done taking orders from Wall Street and Washington and is bent on halting inflation. Their quarterly dot plot ticked up and it looks like at least one more 50bps hike. It’s working, inflation is decelerating. Reality is we will have higher inflation and rates for a while.

&gt; But we have already been in a bear and likely a recession. Bear markets bottom before recessions end and bull markets start when The Street least expects and practically everyone is a bear right now. While it sure looks ugly out there, we contend the worst is behind and a nascent bull is trying to emerge.

&gt; Stocks tend to bottom here in mid-December ahead of the seasonally strong last half of the month, especially small caps – what used to be the “January Effect.”

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/abe551038af905961dbe224f3309291b/14d8e7b82ba5eca8-dd/s500x750/bf884d42dce190a9e6386a7bab4025a8131b2f8d.jpg))**

&gt; The results of the Santa Claus Rally along with the other two components of our “January Indicator Trifecta,” the first five days of January and the full month January Barometer (also created by Yale Hirsch in 1972) will help solidify our outlook for next year.

&gt; When all three are up the S&amp;P 500 has been up 90% of the time, 28 of 31 years, with an average gain of 17.5%. When any of them are down the year’s results are reduced and when all three are down the S&amp;P was down 3 of 8 years with an average loss of -3.6% with bear markets in 1969 (-11.4%), 2000 (-10.1%) and 2008 (-38.5%), flat years in 1956 (2.6%), 1978 (1.1%) and 2005 (3.0%). Down Trifecta’s were followed by gains in 1982 (14.8%) and 2016 (9.5%).

&gt; Keep your eye on the SCR for signs of a new bull or continuing bear. Then watch for the rest of our “January Indicator Trifecta” FFD and JB. When all 3 agree the market generally follows suit.

&gt; We are anticipating a SCR this year. Inflation is easing, the Fed is likely to be done with rate increases in Q1 and we also see supply chain constraints fading now that China is loosening its Covid-19 restrictions. Seasonally speaking, we are also in the middle of the historically strongest period for stocks, the “Sweet Spot of the 4-Year Cycle,” Q4 of midterm years through Q2 of pre-election year.

&gt; # 5 Things To Know About Recessions And Bear Markets

&gt; “I am an optimist because I don’t see the point in being anything else.” Abraham Lincoln

&gt; With all the talk about a pending recession and stocks in a bear market, today, I wanted to share some more thoughts and stats on recessions and bear markets.

&gt; First things first, we do not currently anticipate a recession in 2023, which is quite opposite of the general consensus. You can read more about that here and here.

&gt; What exactly is a bear market? For the definition of a bear market, we are using the traditional definition, which is an index down 20% or more from the recent peak. Yes, there isn’t much difference between 19.8% and 20.0%, so we will also include some near bear markets as well, but when we say bear market, that is what we mean.

&gt; First, do all bear markets take place in a recession? Turns out they don’t, as stocks, indeed can have a bear market without a recession. The worst ever was the 34% bear during the Crash of 1987, which all took place without a recession.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-197-800x595.png))**

&gt; Second, taking things a step further, here we broke down the performance based on if the bear market took place in a recession or not. Take note; we did include some ‘near bear markets’ this time to get more instances. Plus, a near bear feels like a bear market if you are in it. What still amazes us about the table below is that the average bear market without a recession was 24%, and this recent bear was 25%. Assuming we avoid a recession and October was indeed low, this was right on the bullseye.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-264-800x361.png))**

&gt; Now take another look at the table above. The last few bear markets recovered quite quickly. In fact, the last three bear markets that didn’t have a recession recovered in four, four, and three months. Something to think about here, as stocks are two months off the October lows.

&gt; Third, this has been making the rounds lately and has been adding to some of the worries. Looking at all the bear markets that took place around a recession, not once did the bear market end before the recession started. In other words, if we are indeed headed for a recession in 2023, this could suggest that new lows may also be quite likely. Incredibly, bears don’t end for another nine months on average after the recession started, before they find their ultimate low. Again, we don’t see a recession, so this wouldn’t be the case now, but the data is quite compelling.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/BearMarketEnds-800x332.png))**

&gt; Fourth, the month of October tends to be a bear-market killer. Most bears have met their end during the month of October, more than any other month.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/OctoberEnds-800x338.png))**

&gt; Below, we break down those previous 17 bear (or near bear) markets. The bottom line six of them ended in October, and we think there’s a very good chance number seven just happened.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-632-800x455.png))**

&gt; Fifth and lastly, if October was indeed the bear market low, be open to the idea of higher prices over the coming two years. While not a predictor of future behavior, history shows the markets were up more than 40% a year off of the bear-market lows and up almost 60% two years off of them. During uncertain and volatile situations (like the ones that markets have treated us to in 2022), it can be hard to imagine a positive path forward, and all we see are the obstacles. Stepping back a bit can be a helpful reminder of the resiliency of the markets over the long term.

&gt; Dr. Seuss said, “Sometimes the questions are complicated, and the answers are simple.” To me, bear markets can be confusing and complicated, but the answer has always been that they indeed do eventually end, and historically better times will come when they do.

&gt; # 2022 US Stock Market Snapshot

&gt; With just a couple more weeks left in the year, the S&amp;P is down 18.2% year-to-date, which is tracking for the worst year since the Financial Crisis in 2008. As shown below, we've seen huge monthly volatility throughout the year within an overall downtrend. If December's declines hold, we'll have seen a move of 3% or more in either direction in eleven of twelve months this year. September has (so far) been the worst month with a decline of 9.3%, while July was the best month with a gain of 9.1%. In terms of weekday performance, Mondays, Thursdays, and Fridays have averaged declines this year, while Tuesdays and Wednesdays have averaged small gains.

&gt; # Energy Losing Its Grip

&gt; You know those scenes in the movies where a character finds themselves hanging off a bridge, and slowly their sweaty grip starts to loosen as a finger or two starts to slip? That's what the energy sector is going through right now. As oil prices have been under pressure over the last few months, energy stocks had been holding up relatively well as the S&amp;P 500 Energy sector hit a new cycle high exactly a month ago today. Since then, the sector has declined nearly 9% even as the S&amp;P 500 has moved higher. Last week, the sector broke below its 50-DMA for the first time in over two months before stabilizing this week. Since that break below the 50-DMA on 12/6, the sector has made multiple intraday attempts (including today) to get back above it, but each time the sector has sold off and finished off its intraday highs. When looking at a price chart, any time you see a security break below a key moving average and then make several unsuccessful attempts to get back above that level, it's often a sign of a momentum shift.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE IMAGE!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/121422-XLE.png))**

&gt; On a relative strength basis, the Energy sector is also toeing a key trendline. The chart below compares the relative strength of XLE to the S&amp;P 500 (SPY) over the last year. During that time, Energy's relative strength has been riding a trendline higher with bounces each time it kissed that level. The most recent example occurred this week, but at this point, the bounce has been meager. Energy stocks have been outperforming energy commodities in recent months, so it's only natural to see some mean reversion in the stocks as well, but with the sector already breaking below its 50-DMA, this is a key trendline to watch. If the sector's relative strength weakens further, the technical picture for the sector would weaken materially, which would be a development investors in just about every other sector wouldn't shed a tear for.

&gt; # The Monetary Policy Conversation is Going to Shift in 2023

&gt; First, the good news –

&gt; * The Federal Reserve raised the Federal Funds rate by 50 basis points (bps) to the 4.25-4.50% range – a step down from the 75 bps rate hike pace they went with at the last four meetings. This was expected, but it’s always good to see confirmation.
&gt; * They also said that “ongoing rate increases will be necessary” and raised their estimate of the peak rate from 4.6% to 5.1% in 2023, which was not a big surprise. What’s important is that the end of the rate hike cycle is near. The estimate revisions are nowhere as large as what we had seen earlier this year. At the end of 2021, they estimated rates to peak at 2.1% and then continuously shifted those up by 0.6% – 1% increments every three months.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-median-fed-funds-rate-expectation-600x800.png))**

&gt; The not-so-good news: They also provided revised estimates for the economy, which wasn’t great.

&gt; * They revised economic growth lower, from 1.2% to 0.5% (2023)
&gt; * They revised the unemployment rate higher, from 4.4% to 4.6% (about 1% point higher than where it is now)
&gt; * They revised core inflation higher, from 3.1% to 3.5% (2023)

&gt; While Fed Chair Powell was careful to say that they don’t believe these forecasts qualify as a recession, keep in mind that the U.S. has never experienced a 1% rise in the unemployment rate outside of a recession.

&gt; But if you notice, I said “not so good news” instead of “bad news.” Powell pointed out that these are members’ best estimates “as of today,” but that could change as new data comes in. And we have plenty of data coming in. Before their March meeting (when they update the projections again), we have three more inflation reports, three employment reports, and an employment cost index report (which is a preferred gauge of wage growth).

&gt; If you look back at the previous chart, we’ve seen significant shifts in rate expectations just over the course of this year. There’s no reason to think we won’t see more revisions if the data cooperates.

&gt; # The shift: From how fast and how high to how long
&gt; The conversation in 2022 revolved around inflation, which surged to the highest level since 1981. As a result, we saw the most aggressive monetary policy tightening cycle in four decades as the Federal Reserve (Fed) looked to get on top of inflation. The Fed’s singular focus was to ensure they did more than “enough” to lower inflation. Consequently, the over-arching question on investors’ minds across the year was how quickly the Fed would raise rates, and how high they would go.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-14-fed-funds-target-rate-601x800.png))**

&gt; I believe that’s going to shift in 2023. Fed officials will likely start thinking about balance again: the risk of tightening too much vs. the risk of not doing enough. Powell mentioned this in comments he made a couple of weeks ago but didn’t mention it again in his post-FOMC meeting press conference. The omission was curious, more so because we just got a second consecutive inflation report that surprised us to the downside. All he said was that, while the report was encouraging, they need substantially more evidence to believe that inflation has turned a corner. And so, they’ll keep rates “sufficiently restrictive.”

&gt; I think it was probably more a matter of Fed officials not having enough time to digest the report and not revising estimates accordingly. But as I wrote, the prospects of softer inflation in 2023 look good. There is enough reason to believe that disinflation will kick in as we get into the backend of 2023, especially if energy prices don’t spike again and core goods prices continue to ease. Official rental inflation starts to reflect market rents (which are falling rapidly). All of which makes it likely that estimate revisions will happen.

&gt; So, the question for investors will also shift—from how fast and how high to how long and how long they will keep interest rates at an overly restrictive level. The conversation will revolve around how many months of soft inflation data they need to see and how soft it must be. This could obviously take some time since inflation is not going to go down in a straight line – there may be fits and starts and false alarms, but the trend is clear.

&gt; # The risk of “transitory” deflation
&gt; What will upset the apple cart is that the disinflation we see in goods prices and housing is deemed transitory by the Fed, and they maintain rates at an overly tight level. This is not an insignificant risk. Powell again mentioned core services inflation, excluding housing in his press conference. He tied it to wage growth and a tight labor market. This group includes personal care services, education, childcare costs, wireless services, insurance fees, etc. – all captured in the light blue bar in the chart below.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-2022-12-15-core-CPI-576x800.png))**

&gt; As you can see, the good news is that the light blue bar just made its lowest contribution to core inflation in four months. The risk is that the Fed looks past all of this. Instead, they use wage growth and other labor market metrics as their guiding light as they think about “how long to stay restrictive.”

&gt; I think the odds are weighted in favor of them moving lower once inflation starts to fall rapidly, though only by the end of 2023 at the earliest. Which is not as early and not as big cuts as the market currently expects.

&gt; # Is Anyone Bullish?

&gt; “The future ain’t what it used to be.” Yogi Berra

&gt; We’ve noticed a recent trend: nearly no one is looking for stocks to do much in 2023. As Yogi said many years ago, the future ain’t looking too good.

&gt; The general consensus is that the first half of next year could be very rough, with many banks and investment shops expecting stocks to go back to new lows. Here’s a tweet I did summarizing some of the recent calls.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-195-800x364.png))**

&gt; Adding to this, for one of the first times ever, Bloomberg data showed that Wall Street Strategists expect negative returns for the S&amp;P 500 next year. That just doesn’t happen, or it didn’t happen until now.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-275.jpg))**

&gt; We’ve also noticed a considerable spike in put volume over the past week, another way of showing how potentially worried the masses are currently. Then yesterday, I saw this headline, adding to the festive mood.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-361-800x228.png))**

&gt; Here are two more signs of near-historic levels of skepticism. First, the recent Bank of America Global Fund Manager Survey showed a record low level of risk appetite. In other words, lower than the financial crisis and COVID.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-410.png))**

&gt; Second, our friends at TDAmeritrade have proprietary data showing retail investors near the lowest level of sentiment since April 2020. This is called the Investor Movement Index (IMX), which measures what investors are actually doing and how they are positioning in markets. Again, not a lot of excitement out there.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-581-800x523.png))**

&gt; There’s an old Wall Street adage that it is hard to get hurt falling out of a basement window, and we think that could be the case now. Our take is that an incredible amount of negativity is priced into markets currently, and any good news could continue the recent strength off the October lows. Or, as General Patton said, “If everyone is thinking alike, somebody isn’t thinking.”

&gt; What could spark it? It’ll likely be better trends in inflation, which could open the door for the Fed to turn slightly more dovish. Coupled with what we continue to believe is a healthy and robust consumer, the economy may likely avoid the recession that many are expecting. We discussed better trends in inflation here and here.

&gt; It is hard for us not to keep pointing out that it is extremely rare for stocks to fall two years in a row. The S&amp;P 500 was down two years in a row in ’73 and ’74 (one of the worst recessions ever), then three years after the tech bubble burst in the early 2000s, that’s it. Even during the financial crisis, stocks only fell in 2008 before a significant rebound in 2009.

&gt; As the table below shows, it pays not to drive the car looking at the rearview mirror, as what just happened likely won’t happen again. As every time stocks fell in a midterm year (likely where we land in 2022), they bounced back the following year each time and gained 25% on average. Now, to be clear, we aren’t saying stocks will gain 25% next year… But we are saying it isn’t as crazy as it sounds.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/table-for-joey-800x375.png))**

&gt; Warren Buffett said, “Someone’s sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.” Things haven’t been good for investors this year, but there are many opportunities to plant some trees today and benefit from what we predict to be a surprisingly good year for investors in 2023.

&gt; # VIX Death Cross Historically Bullish for S&amp;P 500 over Next 2 Weeks

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://64.media.tumblr.com/701d12ab931a8e09d896aca1743b79b8/45d979a75554c1bd-aa/s500x750/84cf1e777c0891ca4ee5224dedf9b08cf23f5650.jpg))**

&gt; On Friday December 9, a Death Cross appeared on a chart of CBOE Volatility Index (VIX). A Death Cross occurs when the 50 day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average. When this happens to an individual stock or major index like S&amp;P 500 it is normally considered bearish. But since the VIX is designed to measure near-term market volatility the lower it goes the better the S&amp;P 500 usually performs. Thus, a VIX Death Cross can be a bullish indication.

&gt; Going back to 1990, including the most recent cross, there have been 36 VIX Death Crosses. The S&amp;P 500’s average performance 30 trading days before and 60 trading days after the past 35 VIX Death Crosses have been plotted in the following chart. In the 30 trading days prior to the VIX Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 rose an average of 4.1%. This solid advance is what played a large role in the VIX Death Cross as a rising market is normally accompanied by falling volatility and a declining VIX. After the Death Cross, S&amp;P 500 continued to climb another 2.5% over the next 60 trading days.

&gt; Also included on the chart are the 35 VIX Golden Crosses. A Golden Cross is just the opposite of a Death Cross, the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average as VIX is rising. A VIX Golden Cross is not a good event for S&amp;P 500 as it has typically declined an average 2.4% before the VIX Golden Cross and failed to return to breakeven 60 trading days later.

&gt; In following tables, we present the S&amp;P 500 performance after past VIX Death Crosses and VIX Golden Crosses across various timeframes. Based upon average performance the near-term, 1-and 2-week S&amp;P 500 performance following a VIX Death Cross is better than a VIX Golden Cross, but by 1-month later and beyond the results are less clear. This would suggest that the current VIX Death Cross is likely bullish in the near-term, but not a great indication much beyond 2-weeks.

CryptoCurrency,This is NOT a dip lads/ lasses.,"Before we get into it, yes Christmas is around the corner and we all want to be blessed by huge gains and shit, understandable. 

But crypto is seen as volatile by traditional investors and boomers and so on. Monetary policy is going to continue being tight into 2023. At this stage any bad event in crypto would just accelerate the approach of the bottom.

If you were smart and planned this is like an early Christmas gift, when the bottom finally does fall out it never stays that way for long and you don't wanna be that idiot that tries to catch tops during the next bullrun when all the news outlets tell you about 200k eoy.

I have a quick question about how my federal student loans effect my credit score.  I currently owe ~$17,000 in federal loans spread out across six different loans.  

I’ve been trying to find an answer to this online, but I haven’t had much luck.  My question is this: does keeping student loans around help boost your credit score by showing a longer payment history?  Or is there a cutoff point where it’s not really worth it?",finance,1671236302

CryptoCurrency,Buckle into your seat belts for the opportunity of a lifetime,"We are entering the final phase of the bear market. Those that can flip the switch emotionally will look at this opportunity and load the boat.

I’m sure many have seen the cycles chart but those who survive and wait out the next 12-18 months deserve the glory of the bull market. In this chart we are past the panic stage and now heading into anger. Good news is now is the opportunity of a lifetime to plan positions and scale in the next year.

For those who missed 2014, 2018 and the black swan event of 2020 March - don’t make an excuse this time, the train is coming back to the station. I was around in 2014 when the sentiment was 10x worse - if bitcoin can survive that it will succeed.

2023 will go down as one of the best years to historically buy crypto and assets. We went from an extreme case of Quantitative Easing (money printer going brrrr) to Quantitative tightening. These affects usually take 12-24 months to filter through the system. 

Unfortunately the economy isn’t doing well and likely to continue into 2023. We’re not heading for a soft landing - neither is inflation going to the target 2%. The fed is determined to get there - however the many signs point to peak inflation being 9.1% in June 2022 and likely by June 2024 we will be at 3-4% inflation 

There are three stages of the fed pivot that we are seeing signs of entering :

Stage 1 - Slow down of the interest rate hike 

Stage 2 - Pausing if the interest hikes

Stage 3 - Reversal of interest rates 

Historically unemployment in QT and recessions have hit 5.5-7% and we are currently at 3.7% - we have a long way to go. We started seeing mass layoffs in tech and that will happen for the wider economy. Businesses and consumers are tightening their wallets and this will continue to have an impact 

The market tends to bottom before the reversal of interest rates - which will likely come after the second half of 2023 at this pace

Crypto truly is following its past cycles like a book. This cycle corresponds damn almost perfect to the 2024 halving. 

The worst thing you can do is leave the bear market and not build positions, you owe it to yourself to stay disciplined and at the very least do nothing. No one can time the bottom however these prices will be deemed “lucky” by those who join in 2025+",cryptocurrency,1671246334
stocks,Reflections of Poor Decisions in 2022,"As always, this in not financial advice. This is simply a public reflection of my thoughts on the year as it relates to my portfolio. Due your own due diligence and don’t trust the words of a random stranger on the internet.

This year I will likely end the year with a return -30% to -40%, currently down about 35%. As I have done (not on reddit) for several years now, I like to reflect on the quality of my decisions and the outcomes.

Entering 2022 I had the following holdings: GOOGL, AXP, BRKB, CHE, CHWY, CNSWF, DPZ, HIFS, LMND, MSFT, SPGI, SCI, TMX, TSLA, TOITF, U, YETI

During the year, I made the mistake of moving aggressively into beaten down low-quality tech. Names like U, LMND, PLTR, UPST, DDOG, OKTA, SHOP, TEAM, TOST. In terms of the quality of the decisions I would say that I was that I did not make complete well-rounded decisions. On one hand, I generally applaud myself for buying companies when they are out of favor. These names were down 40 to 60% at the time of purchase. Where I did not do well was look at more than factors other than torrid growth rate and a bright future fed to me on the beautiful pages embedded on their investor presentations (let’s look at that and avoid the skeletons in the 10-Q I said to myself). These companies were bought with too much sunshine and not enough rain.

I should have reviewed additional factors: 

First, how are the financials trending other than growth. Sure, revenue was going up gangbusters, what about margins, or dilution or capital requirements, Revenue/EE, Revenue/Sh etc. As I dug under the hood later in the year most of these companies made no advancement on margins despite torrid revenue growth. I realized not digging this far was very very stupid. 

Additionally, I realized throughout time the competitive landscape has changed and I need to update my assessment as well. Take DataDog. My belief about their competitive positioning was “due to the nature of their mission critical software companies are not likely to leave them due to the high switching costs.” One day I went over my portfolio holding by holding and I realized that I had virtually all software names that had an advantage in my view that stemmed from a switching cost. It kind of hit me this is ridiculous. How can every company have a switching cost advantage? The cloud changed everything. Without the need for servers, it is much easier to simply move from one company to another. Now of course there are still training costs and implementation costs to be sure, but the barriers to create software have never been lower and the number of options has never been higher. 

The realization that switching costs in my opinion is not stringent enough of a definition led me to investigate competitive advantages further. As I do often when I feel I have lost my way in investing, I revisit some legendary texts. This time, I revisited Terry Smith’s Owner’s Manual ([https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf](https://www.fundsmith.co.uk/media/mv3abv1h/owners-manual.pdf)). In there, he has a section where he speaks about the types of companies they like. Here is what it said:

“We seek to invest in businesses whose assets are intangible and difficult to replicate

It may seem counter-intuitive to seek businesses which do not rely upon tangible assets, but bear with us. The businesses we seek to invest in do something very unusual: they break the rule of mean reversion that states returns must revert to the average as new capital is attracted to business activities earning super-normal returns.

They can do this because their most important assets are not physical assets, which can be replicated by anyone with access to capital, but intangible assets, which can be very difficult to replicate, no matter how much capital a competitor is willing to spend. Moreover, it’s hard for companies to replicate these intangible assets using borrowed funds, as banks tend to favor the (often illusory) comfort of tangible collateral. This means that the business does not suffer from economically irrational (or at least innumerate) competitors when credit is freely available.”

This section gave me an epiphany! To sum it up, businesses with competitive advantages are built in a way that capital alone is unable to reproduce. In other words, there has to be an intangible factor that capital is unable to recreate. I combined this idea with the other questions I typically ask myself.

· **Company Soundness**

o Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is their evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

o Is their evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

o What is the competitive advantage?

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

· **Growth**

o Is their a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

· **Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

Answering these questions brought down a watchlist of \~75 names to 26.

This filter took names like Amazon off my list. In my opinion, Amazon derives most of its advantage from a long recurring investment in capital. Distribution centers for their retail business and data centers for AWS. Over time as firms have invested in DTC, this has marginalized much of Amazon’s advantage. Additionally, as more cloud players come into the space, the investment in data centers is becoming more common. Ironically, my opinion on Amazon is add odds with Terry Smith given his position in Amazon. As they say, that is what makes a market. Just pull up annual return on assets and you will see one of the reasons why Amazon is plummeting.

Below is my refined list of 26 companies and why I feel capital alone will be able to replicate them sorted alphabetically by name.

Company Ticker Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB Network Effect for Airbnb's. Customers want to shop for Airbnb's where the hosts are. Host want to list where the customers are. 

American Express Company AXP Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

Apple Inc. AAPL Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want phones where they can access the services they customarily use. The Duopoly has been attacked by Microsoft and Amazon, yet we still only have two phone systems.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B Reputation. BRK's reputation has a financial powerhouse makes its insurance division one of the few insurers that can be trusted with large and complex risks. Additionally, management unique operating structure allows for very little conglomerate penalty due to the individual management of many businesses.

BlackRock, Inc. BLK Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history with Blackrock and iShares it will be difficult to upset these funds

Blackstone Inc. BX Track Record. Launching new financial products is extremely difficult to draw assets without a track record. Given their entrenched history across many alternatives it is difficult to select a smaller player.

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  Decentralized operating culture. Management acquires small niche vertically integrated software providers. Their capital allocation is uniquely pushed down to distant levels fromtop management which allows them to scale acquisitions on a decentralized basis. This extremely unique management approach is not something money can buy.

Costco Wholesale Corporation COST Low-Cost Provider. By selling items virtually at cost along with leveraging negotiating powers to drive lowest prices Costco has cemented a foothold in retail. All this value is captured in their annual membership fee.

CRA International, Inc. CRAI Reputation. Within Business consulting, CRAI has a reputation for solving large complex solutions across many industries. When a consultant work with 78 of the fortune 100, you know that paying high fees for results is worth it.

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD Network Effect. CRWD's cloud-based cybersecurity solutions and massive customer base allows for quick handling of threats. As one threat is dealt with, the solutions are synced through the rest of their cloud-based service. This means helping one client helps all and the more customers the strong the service.

Fair Isaac Corporation FICO Regulatory Entrenchment and track record. The FICO score is synonymous with personal lending. Often it is a key determinant for determining loan eligibility. Given its efficient track record at quantifying risk, newer options will be behind as they don't have the track record.

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS Culture of Discipline. There are many banks in this world, virtually none of them are as efficient as HIFS. Their disciplined culture toward underwriting leads to lower than industry average charge offs annually while their focus on costs leads to above industry profitability. If you could re-create this with capital, banks with more scale would have similar returns.

IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. IDXX Trade Secrets. IDXX offers many proprietary tests for vets. This means that only IDXX labs can process them. Additionally, many vets are trained on their tests meaning switching would result in the need for new training.

Lemonade, Inc. LMND Potential to be low-Cost provider and culture of customer care. By offering insurance DTC, Lemonade can avoid many entrenched costs from agency model. Additionally, by getting Guinness World Records for fastest claim paid and removing the frustrating part of insurance which is using it, they have the potential to earn pricing power over time

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU Network Effect. In Latin America they are the leading provider of a P2P payment system (like Venmo). They have captured sizeable portions of the populations in Brazil, Mexico and Columbia.

RLI Corp. RLI Disciplined Underwriting culture and unique track record. Their underwriting culture had led to a 10 BPs lower combined ratio and lower ratio every year for the last decade. Money can't buy discipline. They insure a broad spectrum of odd risks. These are both not easily replicated but offer great diversification in their operations.

Rollins, Inc. ROL Low-Cost Provider. As the largest player in most of their markets, Rollin's benefits from major scale advantages. More contracts allow for pest control people to have greater route density during a day and therefore greater profits as well as negotiate better terms on inputs. This is something that a competitor is unable to solve by throwing money at it. Additionally with high brand awareness with Orkin man, they have a step up on smaller lesser-known players.

Roper Technologies, Inc. ROP Decentralized operating culture focused on end markets that benefit from efficient scale. Efficient scale is when an end market is logically only served by one player in a small area, like a freelance truck distributor. If you are looking for a delivery truck, it makes sense that one website would be best for that.

S&amp;P Global Inc. SPGI Regulatory Entrenchment and Track Record. S&amp;Ps credit rating are required by many contracts and regulations for many debt deals. If you need money and your bank requires it, you’re going to pay a hefty fee for their rating. Additionally, they own the IP for the S&amp;P and Dow Jones indexes. These long track records will never be replaced due to their entrenchment and first mover advantage.

Salesforce, Inc. CRM Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Salesforce is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

ServiceNow, Inc. NOW Network effects. App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. ServiceNow is truly the hub of so many integrated products.

Shopify Inc. SHOP Network effect. For eCommerce players that are looking to compete independently from the likes of Amazon, Shopify is their lifeblood. This means that App developer want to develop where the customers are, and customers want to plug in their other products. Smaller player and late entries like BigCommerce have struggled to gain traction

Tesla, Inc. TSLA Network effect, Brand, Unique Operating Culture in a tough industry. Network effects stem from outsized number of cars on road all outfitted with self-driving equipment giving Tesla more data to develop self-driving cars giving them a data advantage for developing self-driving cars. Additionally, Tesla is the undisputed electric vehicle king given their first mover advantage. Finally, they operate differently than most of their competitors. They build the important and unique components in house whereas legacy auto tends to outsource all parts and simply assemble them. They sell DTC at retail prices whereas legacy auto sell wholesale to dealers. They have a standard labor force whereas most of legacy auto has unionized labor which is trained on legacy ICE engines. The auto industry is historically difficult to enter as it requires large amounts of capital, high fixed costs with a cyclical product.

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN You can't re-create the limited supply of mountains in the world. There are so many mountains and locations with the proper weather conditions to enable skiing. This gives them pricing power, particularly when you account for how many mountains they own in many regions.

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN Government granted monopoly. All .com and .net domains must be registered with VRSN. Additionally, price increases are regulated. Fortunately, ROCs are not

Visa Inc. V Network effect, to upset V you would need to sign up both consumers and vendors all while offering incentives from a significantly smaller scale.

From there I reviewed the 26 companies by valuation and felt 15 of them are compelling investments at this time:

Company Ticker Target

Visa Inc. V 10.00%

Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B 10.00%

Blackstone Inc. BX 8.00%

American Express Company AXP 8.00%

Salesforce, Inc. CRM 8.00%

Constellation Software Inc. CNSW.F  8.00%

Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS 6.00%

Tesla, Inc. TSLA 6.00%

VeriSign, Inc. VRSN 6.00%

Lemonade, Inc. LMND 5.00%

Nu Holdings Ltd. NU 5.00%

Airbnb, Inc. ABNB 5.00%

Vail Resorts, Inc. MTN 5.00%

Shopify Inc. SHOP 5.00%

CrowdStrike Holdings, Inc. CRWD 5.00%

I feel much more confident in the portfolio after re-reviewing the soundness, ability to be replicated, future growth prospects. They key for future years is to avoid laziness when analyzing names. It is foolhardy and expensive to fall in love with an investor presentation and then go and buy it on hopes and dreams rather than seeing the larger picture.

The ironic thing is I have owned 14 of the 15 at some point in my life. For one reason or another I got shaken out of them and bought into the temptress that goes by the name of high growth. Like most temptresses, more research reveals not much substance.

For next steps, I will work on integrating the above process into my stock review routine and stick to it. I find that the hardest part with investing is simply sticking to a practical approach. Its too easy to waver to something new. Variety is the spice of life, but makes for the taste of cocoa powder in investments.

Obviously, these are just my opinions. I welcome your feedback.",finance,1671247290
personalfinance,Can I still cosign with my father for another home if we currently have a mortgage?,"3 years ago I moved to a different city for work and have been renting ever since. I like it here and I'm ready to commit to staying in the area near my work. Thing is, me and my father still have a mortgage in the old city so I'm trying to figure out how exactly this process works. The home has about $400K left on the mortgage and was recently appraised at $950K. He will be retiring soon and will no longer have any use for the home since the majority of my siblings have also moved to different cities in previous years. So my parents who currently live alone now want to move in with me and they like the city I'm in as well due to the space you get in the neighborhoods since they've been living in a very cramped city for decades (think of NYC).

I also dont know if the house will sell because I've noticed that ever since interest rates have gone up, a lot of homes have been in the market for months and its also making me wonder if I should wait to buy until the interest dips or corrects.

If it matters, I gross $80K and my father $75K and we'll be cosigning the new home together (about $600Kish) and I've already got the 20% downpayment covered upfront not including the proceeds from the old home.

Would it be a good idea to cosign for a new home now while waiting to sell the old home or sell the old home and have them rent somewhere for awhile until we can purchase a home and wait for interest rates to dip a bit? My primary concern with the latter is never finding a home because the market might start to pick up again and right now I've noticed there are not a lot of buyers compared to last year.",finance,1671250116

Bitcoin,Read and decide do we want to be sheep or do we truly want to evolve and better ourselves???,"The global economy has been under a monetary policy for the past 100 years that has empowered central banks and puppet governments to get richer while  
 ""retail"" individuals and businesses have become poorer and more ignorant of the suppression of this global power. These central banks and governments   
manipulate the exchange rate for their own benefit, rather than helping the people. If you are not familiar with how central banks and governments operate,  
 it is worth doing some research. A simple Google search for ""fractional reserve system"" will reveal that if a bank has £1000, it can ""lend"" out £9000 at a   
specific payback rate of x%, depending on the bank.  
  
We believe that central banks and governments control everything because we, the ""sheep,"" don't look into these things. Their jargon is too difficult for us   
to understand, so we just think that we don't understand. But if we are capable of running our own businesses - shops, barbershops, bakeries, lettings agencies,  
 gas stations, farms - and producing more wealth than governments and banks, why do they control the middle man who ""does"" the transactions and ""says"" they are legitimate?  
  
Before 2008, we did not have a system that could legitimately take control away from the middle man and his ability to make the rules of money or dictate the value of the   
currency we use. But now, with the emergence of Bitcoin , we have a system where a 1:1 value can be achieved and cannot be changed. 1 Satoshi will always be worth 1 Satoshi.  
 At the time of writing, 1 Bitcoin is worth approximately $16,800 in fiat currency. This means that with $168 in this Bitcoin economy, you would have 10000000 Satoshi.  
  
Let's say we use a 1:1 ratio and, as a farmer, you charge 3, 4, or 5 Satoshi for one egg, plus a network fee of 1 Satoshi (which would not be necessary if we did not use the exchange   
rate dictated by governments and banks). If all energy suppliers adopted this 1:1 ratio, then food suppliers could do the same and use this system instead of relying on the fractional reserve system, where they have an unfair advantage at a ratio of 1:9 without actually producing anything, thereby devaluing the actual currency.  
  
As a producer, which would you prefer: being paid the same amount for your goods and services today, tomorrow, and in 100 years, or giving banks the power to dictate that you must pay   
more to produce and charge more for your products just because the middle man wants to take a share? The adoption of Bitcoin gives individuals and businesses   
the potential to take back control of their financial transactions and reduce their reliance on traditional financial institutions. However, it's important to be aware of the risks and  
 challenges associated with using other types of cryptocurencys.  
If all 18+ aged people understood how the economic system works and how Bitcoin works, they might choose freedom over a ""fiat asset"" that is essentially worthless. Fiat money, which is issued and controlled by governments, has value only because people agree to accept it as payment for goods and services. But we have no control over the supply of fiat money, and governments can print more of it at will, which makes it cheaper.  
  
On the other hand, Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies operate on a decentralized network where transactions are verified by a network of nodes and miners. In order to make any changes   
or improvements to the network, these nodes and miners must reach a consensus of at least 91%. This means that anyone who runs a node has a say in any changes or improvements to the network.   
In contrast, traditional banks are opaque and have no accountability to the public. We have no idea how much money they have, and they can continue to print more even if they are on the verge of bankruptcy.  
  
The current economic system, based on fiat money and controlled by a few powerful banks and governments, is flawed and ultimately leads to homelessness and hunger for many people. The value of money is constantly decreasing,  
 and $100 today might only buy half of what it did even two years ago. By adopting a decentralized system like Bitcoin, we can empower ourselves and take back control, making our own decisions about what our time and effort is worth.  
 Instead of blindly accepting the value that the current system assigns to fiat money, we can use a true 1:1 system where everyone can see and validate the worth of their contributions.   
It's time to stop thinking like sheep and start taking charge of our own economic destiny.

Could we not be capable as retail to produce and service ourselves using the network.

Big whales they could easily buy out power company's and start delivering energy and get paid in Satoshi, price the energy in Satoshi and use excess energy for mining or securing the network, the same with farms. a Bitcoin whale could buy out and teach farmers what Bitcoin is and how it can benefit them, we have to engage producers or make ourselves producers and make our own Bitcoin standard and prices.

With todays tech and possibilities could we not set our own ""retail chains"" from producers to client and leverage the network to our freedom. 

If any one is a producer and if we can get producers from all types of industries in this talk and please feel free to do so. We can truly make a better world of we put our efforts to it.",cryptocurrency,1671275740

personalfinance,new CC before applying for a loan?,"Hey everyone! After avoiding credit and debt for years I've been working hard at building my credit last few years but beyond paying bills on time I am still pretty unfamiliar with how credit really works. I started a new job a couple of months ago that involves frequent flying with united and so I looked into the cards they offer and would like to try and get their Quest card.

I currently have 4 cards with a low collective 5k limit so my credit rating would fluctuate a good amount depending on my my balances. I paid off everything entirely and according to the credit simulator after my next statement on the 19th I'll have a 741 which from what I've read should be plenty to get the quest card.

My problem is the engine in my truck just blew up and now I need to figure out do I either try to get a loan for 10k to replace the engine or finance a new truck? I feel like a new truck is the smarter route how ever my truck is only worth ~5k w/o an engine or 25k w/ an engine and I stubbornly don't want to take the loss on that much money so I'm still trying to figure that one out.

personalfinance,help on how to file 2022 tax and contribution to Roth IRA,"Newbie question for a college freshman student.

Passed 18 years old on year 2022, worked in a donut shop for the summer and below is the ADP YTD summary.

Gross income: $5200

fed tax: $176

social security: $319

medicare: $75

state income tax:: $255

The student was always claimed as dependent in the previous years' tax filing. For year 2022 tax filing, looks maybe different since the student has income.

If the student files his own tax return, he should be able to get the full refund for fed and income tax and he can fund Roth IRA with amount of $5200-$176-$319, is that right? The parents won't be able to claim him as dependent thus loss one standard deduction in their filing.

If the student still files together with parents and claims him as dependent, then student's income be added together with parents' income and taxed at higher rate. And in this case, how many dollar amount will the student be able to contribute to the Roth IRA?

What's the better way?

**Whats the yield curve?**
It shows treasury rates of various durations. Normally longer terms give higher yields and the curve slopes uphill. Inverted yield curves slope slightly downhill and typically predict a recession in the USA. 

**Why does an inverted yield curve typically predict a recession in the USA?**
The Fed increases the short term rates until the market predicts a recession, at which point everyone wants to hold long term treasuries, because the Fed will drop rates into a recession, and if long term rates also drop, then long term treasuries are a fantastic hedge.

I am now receiving a tax-free pension of \~4300/month, and health insurance is included. I am getting married late in 2023 and my fiancée brings home roughly 3800/month after taxes, but we expect her salary to increase over the coming years (became RN in 2021). She currently puts 10% of her check toward a Roth 401k, with a 5% match. We have it invested in a Vanguard Target Date Fund to set and forget. I’m guessing she has 30k there. I originally had a 457(b) through my employer with 40k in it, but I was forced to withdrawal the entirety of it in the beginning of 2022 under the emergency withdrawal stipulation, since I was being bled dry by having to go out of pocket for health insurance and waiting on a decision to be made for the pension. I am still waiting to see how that will affect my taxes this year, I may have to hire an accountant due to the sheer number of abnormal things that happened to me.

Current Financials: We bought our home for 240k in 2018, with a 3.2% interest rate. Mortgage + Taxes + Insurance comes to just a bit over 1600/month. I have a car payment of 400/month that I owe approximately 11k on, my fiancée has my previous car which is fully paid off. With the rest of expenses our monthly bills come out to around 3500, but call it 4k because there are a lot of things we’ve been holding off on buying until we figured out my financial situation. I currently have 65k in my checking account (I was back paid for the pension year+ they owed me), fiancée has approximately 15k in hers. 

I am going back to school for a Bachelor’s in CS, hoping to find something in SWE. I’m not chasing a FAANG career, just something that interests me with good WLB. A work from home or hybrid job would be ideal, because I missed a lot of family time in my previous career. I currently expect to graduate in Fall ’24. 

My question is, what do I do with our savings going forward, at least until I can hopefully land a second career? The last time I was working, my fiancée was bringing home barely half of what she is now, and I was bringing home less due to all of my deductions even though my gross was higher. We’ve never really been in a position where we could really devote extra money to savings, we used to get by mostly comfortably, but a big expense would really hurt our budget.

CryptoCurrency,Decentralization is the big winner of 2022,"2022 has been a brutal year for crypto. The media, politicians and normies have had a field day mocking us given all the failures we have seen. What these people fail to understand many of them because they simply do not want to understand is that all these failures have had centralized points of failure. Be it Ronin, FTX, Luna, 3ac or Solana. What has not failed? Decentralization. Things like Bitcoin, Ethereum Rocketpool, and DEFI in general have not failed. Why? Because the decentralized nature of these protocols does not allow for one individual or a group of individuals to make decisions that affect the rest. No single human can make changes to a protocol, code or monetary policy. Ok, So some protocols have governance voting. Well, that is called community participation and this means we all have a say on the direction we want our protocol to go or the policies to be implemented moving forward.

Whenever someone approaches me to mock me for being in crypto I laugh and remind them that the ethos of crypto is alive and kicking. The chore values of decentralization are today stronger than ever. That I am so happy for all the centralized crooks being exposed and yet I can feel empathy for all the victims of these thieves.

We must continue to push for decentralization. We must continue to invest in decentralized projects. We need to get in and out of centralized exchanges. Learn and teach about self custody. Guard our private keys like our lives depend on it. The tech will improve. It will become safer and the UX will be top notch in due time. For the time being we ""the early ones"" have the privilege of being part of something new, unique and special that can change the lives of so many. 

Decentralization has won in 2022 and will continue to be the one and most important factor as we interact with these protocols. Its not that hard guys. Stick to decentralization. Projects with fundamentals and real life use cases and we will all be fine.

stocks,"[Mark Zandi] “If I didn’t watch business shows or read the Wall Street Journal, the word recession wouldn’t be in my vocabulary."" CNN Report","New York
CNN
 — 
From the executive suite to the grocery aisles to the halls of the Federal Reserve, the big question is: Can red-hot inflation be vanquished without tipping the economy into a recession?

Ironically, all this talking about a recession can actually help cause one. How people feel is a huge driver of consumer behavior and business planning. The famous British economist John Maynard Keynes coined the phrase “animal spirits” to describe what drives investors, consumers and business leaders. Fear, hope, uncertainty, and confidence are all hard to measure — and hugely important to how the economy fares.

Essentially, worrying about a recession and planning for one can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.

“At the end of the day, a recession is a loss of faith,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. Consumers worry about losing a job and so pull back on spending, and business leaders worry their sales will decline and start laying off workers.

“You get into this kind of self-reinforcing negative cycle,” he told CNN’s Early Start. “So when sentiment is this bad and starting to feed on itself, we run the risk of talking ourselves into one.”

The US economy grew at a 2.9% annual rate in the third quarter, and the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low. That’s not going to last. The Federal Reserve this week lowered its forecast for growth in the United States next year to just 0.5% and a jobless rate rising to 4.6% by the end of 2023.

“Look, we’re planning as if there’s going to be a mild recession next year,” United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby told CNN This Morning. “And a lot of people in the business world are trying to talk ourselves into one is what it sometimes feels like to me.”

But he added, “If I didn’t watch business shows or read the Wall Street Journal, the word recession wouldn’t be in my vocabulary because we just don’t see it in our data.”

stocks,John Carmack leaving META. “… we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort … our organization is operating at half the effectiveness …”,"Virtual Reality Pioneer Is Leaving Meta

John Carmack, who was chief technology officer of Oculus, which Meta bought, is departing the company.

John Carmack, a pioneer of virtual reality technology, is leaving Meta after more than eight years at the company, according to an internal post reviewed by The New York Times.

In the post, which was written by Mr. Carmack, 52, the technologist criticized his employer. He said Meta, which is in the midst of transitioning from a social networking company to one focused on the immersive world of the metaverse, was operating at “half the effectiveness” and has “a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort.”

“It has been a struggle for me,” Mr. Carmack wrote in the post, which was published on an internal forum this week. “I have a voice at the highest levels here, so it feels like I should be able to move things, but I’m evidently not persuasive enough.”

As the former chief technology officer of Oculus, the virtual reality company that Facebook bought for $2 billion in 2014, Mr. Carmack was one of the most influential voices leading the development of V.R. headsets. He stayed with Facebook after Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, decided to shift the company last year to focus on the metaverse and renamed Facebook as Meta.

Yet even though Meta was moving swiftly into an area that Mr. Carmack specialized in, he was sometimes a dissenting voice about how the effort was going. He became known for internal posts that criticized the decision-making and direction set forth by Mr. Zuckerberg and Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer. Mr. Carmack had been working part-time for the company in recent years.

What Is the Metaverse, and Why Does It Matter?


The origins. The word “metaverse” describes a fully realized digital world that exists beyond the one in which we live. It was coined by Neal Stephenson in his 1992 novel “Snow Crash,” and the concept was further explored by Ernest Cline in his novel “Ready Player One.”

The future. Many people in tech believe the metaverse will herald an era in which our virtual lives will play as important a role as our physical realities. Some experts warn that it could still turn out to be a fad or even dangerous.

Mr. Carmack and Meta did not respond to requests for comment. Insider earlier reported on Mr. Carmack’s departure.

Meta’s earnings have been hit hard by its spending on the metaverse and its slowing growth in social networking and digital advertising. In July, the Silicon Valley company posted its first sales decline as a public company. Last month, Meta said it was laying off about 11,000 employees, or about 13 percent of its work force, in what amounted to the company’s most significant job cuts.

In a podcast interview in August, Mr. Carmack said Meta’s $10 billion loss at the time in the division housing its augmented reality and virtual reality initiatives made him “sick to my stomach.” He added that the company’s metaverse efforts have been hampered by bureaucracy and dogged by concerns about diversity and privacy.

In other posts seen by The Times from this year, Mr. Carmack criticized features on the company’s Quest virtual reality headsets. In his farewell post, he commended the Quest 2 headset as “almost exactly what I wanted to see from the beginning” in terms of its cost and mobile hardware, though he was still critical of its software.

“We built something pretty close to The Right Thing,” he said.

Mr. Carmack’s post, which said he was ending his decade in V.R., concluded by saying he had “wearied of the fight” and would focus on his own start-up. (He announced in August that his artificial intelligence firm, Keen Technologies, had raised $20 million.)

“V.R. can bring value to most of the people in the world, and no company is better positioned to do it than Meta,” he wrote.

Before Meta, Mr. Carmack pioneered various techniques in computer graphics that became crucial to games that he developed, including Quake. He joined Oculus in 2013 as chief technology officer and stepped down from that role in 2019, moving into a part-time role.

Mr. Carmack this week also testified in a court hearing over the Federal Trade Commission’s attempt to block Meta’s purchase of Within, the virtual reality start-up behind a fitness game called Supernatural. The agency has argued that the tech giant will snuff out competition in the nascent metaverse if it is allowed to complete the deal. The hearing is expected to continue next week.",finance,1671313020

In academia, I read papers, of course. Lately, I switched to looking for RSS feeds on Hackernews, heiße Security, krebsonsecurity, and such.

&gt;FTX founder and former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried will  no longer contest extradition to the U.S., an about-face just days after  he was remanded to Bahamian jail pending a hearing, a person familiar  with the matter told CNBC.  
&gt;  
&gt;The former crypto billionaire will  appear in Bahamian court this Monday to formally waive his extradition  rights, paving the way for federal authorities to secure his return to  the U.S.  
&gt;  
&gt;Extradition  between the Bahamas and the U.S. is codified by a 1991 treaty. In  practice, the process takes months, if not years, to complete because  the accused have numerous chances to appeal. Bankman-Fried’s legal team  had initially said that it planned to fight extradition. The change of  heart would move up the timeline for Bankman-Fried’s federal trial  significantly.  
&gt;  
&gt;The 30-year-old MIT graduate was originally scheduled for his next hearing in February 2023.  
&gt;  
&gt;A representative for Bankman-Fried declined to comment.  
&gt;  
&gt;Bankman-Fried  was indicted in New York federal court on Monday, on charges of wire  fraud, securities fraud, conspiracy to defraud the United States, and  money laundering. If sentenced, he could face the rest of his life in  prison. The former FTX CEO also faces concurrent charges from the  Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading  Commission over similar allegations that he worked to defraud FTX  customers of billions of dollars since 2019, the year the exchange was  founded.  
&gt;  
&gt;At the heart of Bankman-Fried’s empire was Alameda  Research, a crypto hedge fund that federal regulators allege used FTX  customer money to engage in trading which lost billions of dollars.  
&gt;  
&gt;FTX’s collapse was precipitated when [reporting by CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/02/divisions-in-sam-bankman-frieds-crypto-empire-blur-on-his-trading-titan-alamedas-balance-sheet/) revealed  a highly concentrated position in self-issued FTT coins, which  Bankman-Fried’s hedge fund Alameda Research used as collateral for  billions in crypto loans. Binance, a rival exchange, announced it would  sell its stake in FTT, spurring a massive withdrawal in funds. The  company froze assets and declared bankruptcy days later. Charges from  the SEC and CFTC indicated that FTX had commingled customer funds with  Bankman-Fried’s crypto hedge fund, Alameda Research, and that billions  in customer deposits had been lost along the way.",cryptocurrency,1671334742

**Cloud:**  
**2022:**  
% forecast: Due to covid, businesses were pushed to go digital so firms are more receptive to automation so Cloud is likely to take up a larger portion of revenue over time.  


Y/Y forecast: The average of 2020 - 2021 is taken when forecasting Y/Y cloud 2022 as these took into account the effects of covid, however a limitation recognised here would be that in 2022 high inflation led to high interest rates so Y/Y growth may not be so high.

**%** forecast: I forecast that cloud will start taking up a larger percentage of revenue as the Fed do expect interest rates to come down by end of 2024 when interest rates fall businesses are likely to be able to invest in the business and automate.

Y/Y forecast: Due to a lack of industry knowledge I’m going to be conservative and assume a slightly higher than historic growth rate of 2% Y/Y per year from 2023 to 2024.

**2025 - 2026:%** forecast: I estimate cloud will probably peak at about 15% due to tougher competitions from AWS and market saturation.

Y/Y forecast: Due to the full effects of falling interest rates finally showing up due to the lag in policy in 2025, Y/Y increase is going to spike higher than past forecasted years.

**2027 - 2030:%** forecast: I estimate that cloud will probably plateau at about 13.5% onwards.

Y/Y forecast:  Revenue is plateaued to 47% as a conservative estimate

**Advertising:**

**2022:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in terms of % of revenue due to decrease in retail spending and tougher inflation environment.

Y/Y forecast: To prevent Y/Y growth from being skewed by 2020 Covid, I only took the average of 2018-2019 where advertisers had the confidence of spending on advertisement without taking covid into consideration.

**2023 - 2025:**% forecast: Advertising is going to decrease in 2023 and 2024 due to high interest rates and uncertain environment for investors. A conservative 1% was used in decline as advertising is still GOOG’s core operations.

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is assumed to be more conservative as advertising is a matured business of GOOG. But 2025 Y/Y growth will be higher due to lower interest rates.

**2026 - 2030:**% forecast: GOOG is likely to continue being a strong seller of advertisements and their expansion into different modal for google searches is likely to keep their advertisement revenue high.Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth is harder to forecast due to uncertainty in interest rates policy from 2025 onwards.**Others:**% forecast: I’m uncertain of how exactly to accurately depict others but it is not something that GOOG focuses on especially when you listen to their past few earnings calls. So % I’ll just use others to top up till 100%

Y/Y forecast: Y/Y growth I’ll assume plateaus at about 18% due to strong competition from Apple.

&amp;#x200B;

**EBIT:**

The average of 2020 and 2021 were taken when forecasting 2022 as 2020 was when there were high layoffs due to covid uncertainty and 2021 was when there was low interest rates that allowed companies to reinvest more than usual.

GOOG is still reinvesting large sums back into cloud so EBIT is taken to decrease till 23% with reference to 2018 and 2019 where it seemed like a steady margin and the most efficiently run GOOG was.To be conservative I’ll just assume EBIT goes to 20% by the end of my forecast period.

**Taxes:**

Due to GOOG being high in R&amp;D I’d assume Taxes hold steady at 20% throughout my forecast.

**D&amp;A:**

Assumed to be at 7% throughout

**Deferred Taxes:**

Being a relatively small line item, I assume that deferred taxes are going to get smaller as GOOG would probably know how to value their PP&amp;E properly as more time goes on. But since it is a small line item, I just put it at a constant 1% to avoid over or undercompensating for it,

**Change in NWC:**

Assumed to be at 1% throughout

**CapEX:**

I assume GOOG is going to ramp up CapEX going into 2025 due to interest rates expected to be lowered by then. But over time as Cloud becomes matured I don’t see CapEX taking up a large portion so I tend it towards 10% just above D&amp;A

**WACC:**

COE, GOOG does not pay dividend yield so most of COE comes from average % price increase in its stock.I’d assume GOOG has a market beta of the average between 1.25 and 1.06  based on [https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/\~adamodar/New\_Home\_Page/datafile/Betas.html](https://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/Betas.html) GOOG is classified under information services? And [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GOOG/)Risk free rate at the time of 2021 was about 2%.

Risk premium was 5.5% based on [https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/664840/average-market-risk-premium-usa/)

COE = 8.35%

COD, GOOG’s bond yield was taken into consideration for this.

[https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:\~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85)](https://cbonds.com/bonds/55087/#:~:text=International%20bonds%3A%20Google%2C%203.625%25%2019may2021%2C%20USD%20(US38259PAB85))

COD = 3.625%

%Equity = 100% - 30.37% = 69.62%%Liability = 97072/319 616 = 30.37%Tax Rate = 19% based on 2021’s Taxes

📷

Extract from GOOG’s 2021 10-K

Total WACC = 69.62% x 8.35% + 30.37% x 3.625% x (1 - 19%) = 6.71%

TGR = 2.5%

some very specific questions I have:

1. Is my Tax forecast by holding it at 20% unrealistic?
2. Is it okay to keep depreciation constant at 7% of sales?
3. Unsure of how exactly to accurately depict change in NWC?
4. Was there a better way of finding out WACC for GOOG?",finance,1671350221

They have stable US federal government retiree pensions, so they don't need a great deal of money sitting in cash (and they already have plenty in their checking accounts). I'm a little worried about the target date fund because even though it's the risk profile they want, after what happened with Vanguard's capital gains distributions, I worry they could be hit with a huge tax bill by accident.

Everything is either flat or down this year, so they can consolidate this year (or next year) without incurring a huge tax hit. Would it make sense to replicate the target date fund with some of its components? Like a US equity fund and a US bond fund? Both of my parents are in their 80s so they don't necessarily have a long time horizon, but they wanted to ""take a little more risk"" than just having most everything in money market funds.",finance,1671372829

I currently have about $13,000 remaining on a MyChase plan on my credit card from a surgery. The fees I pay to ""finance"" it though a MyChase plan are about 0.67% (Yes, less than 1%). Due to having a larger portion of my available credit tied up, my credit score has dropped to about 740. My question: which is the better financial decision?

I just received a check from my health share that will reimburse me fully for all surgery costs... is it better to (a) pay off my surgery debt, wait for my credit score to refresh to a higher score and then go finance a car at the best interest rate I can or (b) use this check as a down payment on a car?

The logic behind the thinking is, either way, there's $13,000 that's being financed. Is it smarter to leave it financed at 0.67% instead of rolling that $13k into a much higher auto rate? Or is it better to put that down on the car and have a smaller financed/value rate on the car?

If it's pertinent, the car I'm looking at is in the $26k range, unless I give in to temptation and get one in the $31k range. I plan on taking care of the car and driving it until the wheels fall off. New, ""fun and shiny"" cars can be reserved for the wife.

(Edit 1: fixing spacing problems)

investing,Opinions on borrowing money to invest in the stock market?,"I've heard in the past that it's not smart to borrow money or take out a loan and invest it into the Stock Market.

In the past I would take out $10,000-$20,000 loans that ran for \~5 years at an interest rate anywhere from 7%-9%.

Yes I know that ultimately I shouldn't be doing that. Fortunately I got really lucky and placed them into very good blue chip companies before deciding to just withdraw it all and then just dump everything into an S&amp;P500 index fund.

There is another interesting thing about this strategy that I wanted to point out. That even though the interest rates were high at 7%-9%, and the loans were for about 5 years, I would pay them all off within less than a year like anywhere from 6months-8months. So I didn't have to pay much interest on the loan due to paying it off so quickly. My goal was to simply take a large lump sum and quickly put it all into the market. Basically ""time in the market"" &gt;&gt;&gt; all else. It would have taken me considerably longer to wait to accumulate $20,000 with my bi-weekly pay checks.

personalfinance,"Supplemental insurance companies for life, disability, and long-term care insurance can and will deny you from purchasing a policy based on your genetic information (US)","This applies to the US, but check out insurance laws and protections where you live.

It's fucked up but it happens all the time.

Source: GINA, and I work in healthcare with a patient population that has a genetic disease, so this is relevant to predictive genetic testing. Getting predictive genetic testing done prior to securing these supplemental policies is a very common and understandable mistake.

With respect to insurance, GINA’s protections are limited to health insurance: it does not cover life, disability, or long-term care insurance. Also, there is a small business exemption for employers with fewer than 15 employees. The law also does not apply to individuals receiving their insurance through the federal government or the military. In addition to GINA, there are other laws and policies that offer additional protections against genetic discrimination.

CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Bill C-249: Encouraging Growth of Crypto Sector Defeated (Canada),"The [Bill](https://www.parl.ca/Content/Bills/441/Private/C-249/C-249_1/C-249_1.PDF) was first read on February 9th, 2022 after being brought forward by [Michelle Rempel Garner](https://www.ourcommons.ca/Members/en/michelle-rempel-garner(71902)) (Calgary Nose Hill-C).

The bill was hoped to direct members of the federal government to develop a framework to allow cryptocurrencies to be developed and researched in Canada.

&gt; This enactment requires the Minister of Finance to develop a national framework to encourage the growth of the cryptoasset sector and, in developing the framework, to consult with persons working in the sector who are designated by provinces and territories. The enactment also provides for reporting requirements in relation to the framework.

To quote Hon. Garner [during the first reading](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-27/hansard),

- … right now, Canada should be attracting billions of dollars of investment in the fast-growing cryptoasset industry…
- we are seeing government officials discuss and set policy related to cryptoassets…
- many officials and lawmakers are not deeply familiar with what cryptoassets are, how they function or their big potential for economic growth… 
- Canada needs to ensure cryptoasset experts and investors are telling us what policy they need or what policy they do not need… 
- require the Minister of Finance to formally ensure their voices help lead policy development… develop a framework using their expertise that would ensure Canada attracts investments and talent related to cryptoassets while protecting those who work with them…
- create a mechanism to formally engage the expertise of cryptoasset innovators and investors in policy development and create a framework for growth

All in all, it would have directed the government to take guidance from experts in the sector, to develop a framework that would allow this industry to flourish in Canada.

Bill C-249 was [defeated on November 23rd, 2022](https://www.ourcommons.ca/DocumentViewer/en/44-1/house/sitting-133/hansard). 119 members of the House of Commons supported the Bill, while 199 were against it.

I think it would have been great to have the government get behind crypto growth in Canada. It’s likely that any decisions made by government regulating the industry will be created with limited input from experts.

The current federal Minister of Finance is [Chrystia Freeland](https://pm.gc.ca/en/cabinet/honourable-chrystia-freeland) (University-Rosedale, Lib). She has been vocal [against crypto investments](https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/2111586371696/) in the past (video). However, the 2022 Fall Economic statement (Nov 3rd, 2022) describes *Addressing the Digitalization of Money* saying,

- … Budget 2022 announced the government’s intention to launch a financial sector legislative review focused on the digitalization of money and maintaining financial sector stability and security. - Consultations with stakeholders on digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies, are being launched on November 3, 2022.

It is worth pointing out that the second reading of Bill-249 was defeated after Budget 2022 was released. It’s unclear to me why C-249 was defeated just to have the minority Liberals (and NDP) just include consultations with stakeholders in the Budget.

Regarding consultations, the a [Government of Canada says](https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/news/2022/11/government-consults-canadians-to-advance-key-priorities.html),

- … digitalization of money to maintain financial sector stability and security in the face of digital assets and cryptocurrencies being used to avoid global sanctions and fund illegal activities. 
- … Department of Finance is launching targeted consultations with stakeholders on digital currencies, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies. 
- Canadians can also send their comments to financepublic-financepublique@fin.gc.ca. This will help inform future policy development, as well as further and broader public consultations on this matter.

So, if you’re Canadian you can send comments to the above email address. The government will make a decision, and it’s up to you if you want to be heard in the process.",cryptocurrency,1671410789

Hedge funds, meanwhile, have been paring how much risk they are taking in stocks or making outright bets that major U.S. indexes will tumble. Mutual funds have increased their cash positions to about 2.5% of their portfolios this fall, up from around 1.5% at the end of last year and the highest level since early 2020, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.

Ben Snider, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, said institutional and individual investors often dump stocks in tandem when the economy is slowing and indexes are tumbling. That doesn’t appear to have happened this year, despite the S&amp;P 500’s decline.

“The fact that you have not seen very much selling from households is surprising,” Mr. Snider said. 

U.S. households typically sell about $10 billion in stocks after the S&amp;P 500 falls at least 10% from its peak. Investors yanked money from stock funds in 2015 and 2018, the last times the index suffered annual losses, EPFR data show. 

The S&amp;P 500 is on pace for its worst year in more than a decade, marked by volatility that continued last week when the Federal Reserve and central banks around the globe kept raising interest rates.

In the coming days, fresh data on housing and consumer spending will provide more clues on the health of U.S. consumers and how the Federal Reserve’s interest rate increases are rippling through the economy.

Brian Wilkinson, 60 years old, said he has seen worse in the markets. He witnessed the 1987 stock-market crash, remained invested after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and rode out the 2008 financial crisis. The market always bounced back. 

With inflation high, he still thinks he has a better shot at earning high returns from stocks than bonds.  

Never a big spender on such things as eating out or entertainment, Mr. Wilkinson has continued contributing cash to his church and stashing away money toward retirement funds. This year, he increased his exposure to stocks to roughly 70% of his portfolio. Paying down the mortgage on his home has given Mr. Wilkinson, who lives near Nashville, Tenn., extra firepower to keep investing. 

“Stocks are really the only game in town to ultimately beat inflation,” Mr. Wilkinson said. 

Still, watching his investments tumble has been trying. 

“It’s painful,” Mr. Wilkinson said. But “it’s the mistakes people make in the downturns that hurt people the most.” 

Consumers’ resilience has been a buffer of support for the market this year. Despite worries about a recession, the jobs market remains robust and wages have kept ticking higher. Of course, there are signs that trend is turning. Retail sales in November posted their biggest drop in nearly a year, showing that people are spending less on everything from electronics to books.

And the Fed has indicated it isn’t done raising rates. 

That is one reason for the pessimism among many institutional investors. Net bearish positions tied to stock futures hit a record high over the summer, according to Deutsche Bank data, a sign that asset managers and hedge funds were bracing for stocks to keep tumbling. Many of those investors appear to have reduced their bearish positions lately, although as of early December, they were far from bullish.

Meanwhile, one measure of how exposed hedge funds are to the stock market—the share of their positions invested in bullish stock positions versus bearish—has fallen to the lowest level since early 2019 among funds tracked by Goldman. 

In a note in early December, Amy Wu Silverman, a managing director at RBC Capital Markets, said her clients, which include hedge funds and asset managers, were “quite bearish.”

In one sign of how reluctant many are to make bold stock bets, even knowing others across Wall Street were bearish wasn’t enough to entice some to take a contrarian, bullish stance, she said.

That is why some strategists say a big rally through the end of the year would see many institutional investors wrong-footed.

Some were caught off guard in 2020, for example. Stock futures positioning among asset managers and leveraged funds hit a low around mid-June, and the S&amp;P 500 went on to rally about 8% over the next two months and roughly 20% through the end of the year. 

For many individuals, such a rally would be welcome after they waded in to buy the dip in stocks for much of the year, only to see shares fall further. The buy-the-dip trade, which rewarded investors handsomely in the decade after the 2008 financial crisis, is on pace for its worst year since 1979, with stocks falling around 0.7% the week after a 1% decline, according to Dow Jones Market Data. 

George Feygin, a lawyer based in Peachtree City, Ga., said he hasn’t changed his strategy this year and has kept adding to his investment accounts each month. In June, he put a chunk of his bonus into a fund tracking the S&amp;P 500. 

“I’m buying low, hopefully,” he said.

I'm looking for a loan with low origination fees and no prepayment penalties. I don't want to buy down points, I don't mind a higher apr since I want to pay of the loan early. 

The quotes I've gotten from installers so far have been the standard terrible financing terms with all sorts of dealer fees that just seem to magically end up being about the same amount as the federal tax credit. And we unfortunately don't have the pockets to pay cash upfront.

Just bought the house so a HELOC isn't an option.  I could use the credit union I'm a member of but they didn't seem interested in loaning out for solar.  

How are you guys finding reasonable lenders? I've seen a green credit union out of Colorado and found matadors community credit union in socal.  Any links to state lending programs seem to be dead.",energy,1671430928

stocks,Why December CPI numbers are likely going to show deflation and why annualized inflation will rapidly approach 0 in 2023.,"As we all know, inflation is the buzzword of the moment. However, November's CPI was only +.1%, which would be 1.2% inflation annually. The numbers have come down dramatically since June of 2022, which showed a month over month gain of 1.3%. In other terms, as of November 2022 data, the annualized rate has dropped to what the monthly rate was only five months prior - a 92% decrease. 

What will December CPI show? We have inklings. 

Retail gas prices, available here -

https://ycharts.com/indicators/us_gas_price

show that we are down about 13-14% from November. 

https://www.wsj.com/market-data/commodities

Natural gas, crude oil, heating oil, and retail gas futures are all also down from November, variably so, but DOWN. An approximate 10-20% decrease across the board is apparent. 

What else is dropping? Food commodities are also visible at the WSJ chart, corn and wheat, coffee, all are plunging - the only exceptions are cattle and sugar. 

https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cpi.pdf

As we can see from the CPI inputs, we have data at our fingertips showing that most of the inputs are down A LOT from November. Groceries and eating out are stickier than the raw commodity prices so they will not match the futures exactly, but the trend is down. The car market is also f*cked. The only numbers we cannot get (unless someone can - would be great!) are for shelter and the other factors at the bottom of the chart, but with the recent revisions to the BLS job numbers (no growth!) and the stalled housing market I think rents are also probably stable at this point. 

What does this mean? 

Apparently the ""trading economics"" forecast for December CPI is +.2%. I disagree with this. Energy prices have been falling significantly since mid November, as have most commodity prices across the board. The rise in interest rates has already put us into recession IMO even if the numbers do not confirm this yet, and I believe fed policy is misguided as this entire fiasco was due to the supply chain issues generated by COVID and the invasion of Ukraine, NOT from loose monetary policy which was necessary to keep the economy afloat in the face of both crises. 

In sum, I think the data we already have for December - barring something unforeseen at the end of the month - confirms that the next CPI print out will show DEFLATION. In fact, I would not be surprised if it was even -.5%. December 2021 CPI was +.6% (annualized +7.2%), if we are at 0% this month, inflation will have fallen by 100% year over year, and annualized CPI will drop to 6.5%. If we are -.5%, it will be down to 6%, a drop of 15.5% in one month! 

The future is bleaker from there. The next print outs after Dec 21 were Jan 22 (+.6%), Feb 22 (+.8%), and March 22 (1.2%). April saw a relaxation (.3%), May went back up (+1%), and June was the peak (+1.3%). 

If we assume 0% inflation through June 2023 - which I think may be GENEROUS given the energy numbers, the prohibitive interest rates, and the possible resolution of the Ukraine crisis and the continued amelioration of supply chain issues - off an annualized baseline of 6.5%, we would hit 5.9% in January, 5.1% in Feburary, 3.9% in March, 3.6% in April, 2.6% in May, and 1.3% in June. I.E., with values at zero and NOT negative, we are going to see today's annualized number become the actual annualized number as of 6/2023. 

If December of 2022 comes in below 0 - i.e., -.5% as I think is quite possible given the energy plunge - things accelerate faster. Assuming we are at 6% annualized in Dec 2022 and the monthlies are -.3% through June 2023, we would be at 5.1% as of 1/22, 4% as of 2/22, 2.5% as of 3/22, 1.9% as of 4/22, +.6% as of 5/22, and -1% by June of 2022. 

Barring another black swan event - which is possible, but could also result in even more deflation! - the trajectory since June of 2022 would put as at annualized inflation of under 2% between March and June of 2023, with a risk of actual annualized DEFLATION also appearing sometime after April 2022 if the December trends continue. 

What does this mean? I think the Fed pivot will accelerate, I think we have one or, at most, two small hikes before the pause, and I also think that we will see rate CUTS by June of 2023. This likely portends a stock market bottom that has already occurred or will occur in Q1 of 2023, and if we see several consecutive negative CPI print outs, QE is likely back on the table by Q2-Q3 of 2023.",finance,1671445056

&gt; The lat­ter in­cludes Fed­eral Re­serve re­mit­tances from in­ter­est on its bond hold­ings, which fell to $1 bil­lion from $15 bil­lion, ac­cord­ing to the Con­gres­sional Bud­get Of­fice. Those re­mit­tances will turn into deficits as the cen­tral bank pares its bond port­fo­lio.

&gt; State rev­enues are also headed for an ad­just­ment, es­pe­cially in cap­i­tals that built in new struc­tural spend­ing oblig­a­tions dur­ing the pan­demic. Cal­i­for­nia, that means you, and Sacra­mento now faces a $25 bil­lion deficit. The New York state comp­troller is also warn­ing about po­ten­tial deficits, as fed­eral pan­demic aid winds down and tax rev­enue falls.

&gt; One irony is that high-tax pro­gres­sive states have ben­e­fit­ted in par­tic­u­lar from the cap­i­tal-gains in­come of the high earn­ers they claim to de­spise. But cap­i­tal-gains rev­enue is sure to plunge given the enor­mous de­cline in stock prices this year. Cor­po­rate tax rev­enue is also likely to slow as earn­ings are un­der pres­sure.

&gt; All of this was predictable since the good times were kept afloat by easy money and a highly progressive tax code. Federal tax receipts as a share of GDP hit a near record 19.6% in fiscal 2022, and Congress spent like it would never end. Well, it always does, and that is before the widely predicted recession in 2023.",finance,1671461686
personalfinance,Seeking Math assistance - PMI and Additional Principal payment for first time homeowner,"Hey folks! I posted in the mega thread last week, hoping to get a few more eyeballs with a post. This is a request for help with housing payment math: if that's not your thing, I appreciate you clicking anyway. 

My partner and I are first time homeowners, about to make our first mortgage payment. We're looking at the math for how much extra principal payments will affect our total interest and when we can remove our PMI. I've got a massive spreadsheet on amortization, but am not experienced enough with excel to put together something that can better represent our situation. Does anyone have links to really great spreadsheets on this issue? We're trying to determine what monthly principal payment, and at what amount, makes the most sense. Here's the numbers on our situation:

5% downpayment on a $475000 home, resulting in a $451250 mortgage. 

Interest rate is 3.875% (yes, we got very, very lucky). 

PMI is $105.30 monthly. 

To my partner and I, this means we likely make extra payments on the mortgage until we hit 22% principal. Then, because the market rate of return is higher than our interest rate, we probably switch to investing. I have been informed PMI cannot be removed for two years, but that's not an issue - we would need to pay at least $3760 monthly to do so, and our max additional monthly payment is $1600. 

Any type of spreadsheet to help me make better decisions would be extremely helpful - thank you! I'm trying very hard to make informed decisions.",finance,1671462870

Committee members will present closing arguments on their investigation into the Capitol attack, formally adopt their final report, and vote on both civil and criminal referrals in connect to Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election.

Trump himself is expected to face criminal referrals, reportedly for conspiracy to defraud the United States, obstruction of an official proceeding of Congress, and insurrection. Referrals are also expected for other Trump allies, including Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with Congressional subpoenas. Committee Chair Bennie Thompson has suggested referrals for ethics violations, legal misconduct and campaign finance violations may also be issued. However, the Committee's referrals are non-binding and it will be up to federal prosecutors to bring charges.

At the meeting, Committee members will also vote to adopt the official record, effectively authorizes the public release of its final report. A preview of the report may be offered today, though the actual release is expected to take place later on Wednesday. The report is understood to be over 1,000 pages long; for comparison, the Mueller Report was 448 pages.

personalfinance,Employer not properly taxing bonus,"My husband works for a small company (less than 20 employees). His office has no HR. His boss keeps not withholding taxes on his bonuses.

The year prior we owed a couple thousand.  What can I do to avoid that this year? Should I just pay the estimated tax (he just got an end of year bonus this week)? It looks like only 7.9% was withheld which just can't be right.  And how do I figure out what that is ? What I found on the IRS site seems to be more for self employed (we are both W2) employees.

We could afford to pay cash for the car but we are also looking to buy a house in 1-2 years, so I feel it might be wise to hang on to that cash. Considering auto loan interest rates are pretty high (~5-6%), it's not a super obvious choice to me however. The difference in monthly payments with a big down payment on the car versus none are not a big deal for us, but looks like it would take 4-5 years to save the cash again from the savings on the smaller monthly payments. Would a good way to think about it be that we would be paying a premium of the interest on the larger loan (~2k over 4-5 years), in order to have the 30k available sooner?  I'm wondering if we would be making a dumb decision to take a big loan for the car when we have the means to pay it off fast. Maybe a compromise of say a 20% down payment would be best?

stocks,2023 will be a year of doom - CMV,"Everybody now is focused on inflation, when they should be focusing on the outlook of fundamentals for companies heading into 2023.

The way I see it, people are struggling wether inflation is going up or down. People’s savings are gone due to the elevated prices all year round, especially for necessities like housing and gas. And so buying power in general got depleted, or at the very least decreased significantly. Now couple that with the high interest rates and you got your recipe for disaster. 

Companies will start laying people off, and they’ve started already. And when earnings for companies start coming in very low, I think the market will take a veryyy big hit. I cant see the market recovering before this happens. 

Anybody got an opposing thesis/bull arguments?

Edit : An important part I forgot to mention. The question that lead me to this is the following. How will people get out of the financial holes they’re falling in due to the inflation that already took place without big increases in salaries?

Bitcoin,The basic economics of why Bitcoin has value,"I've been seeing a lot of new people that seem to have no grasp on the basics of economics regarding currency, what gives it value, etc. I posted this as a comment in another thread that didn't get much attention, so I thought I would post it again as its own post to help those who are new to Bitcoin or don't have much understanding of the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin as a currency.

First  you need to ask yourself why the Dollar has any value. Learn a bit  about the history of money. The first currencies were commodity money.  They derived their value from their intrinsic use. But they were  cumbersome to use. So we invented paper money that was backed by  commodities such as gold, which could be exchanged for it, and gave it  value. In 1971 the US Fed stopped allowing Dollars to be exchanged for  gold, making our money fiat money with no backing. Fiat means ""command"".  It is created out of nothing by an issuing authority.

Now  think about what the Federal Reserve has been doing, and the effects  their actions have had on the economy. They previously lowered interest  rates to 0%. Interest rates are the cost of obtaining money. Money that  has no cost to obtain has an unlimited supply and its value will trend toward zero as the supply is diluted. The money  supply has been increased by more than 40% over the last 2 years, and  much more than that over the previous century. You can view the Fed's  own data here: [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2SL)  . The value of the  Dollar over the long term is trending toward zero,  along with every other fiat currency. Look at this chart and see how  much value it has lost over time. [https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1](https://www.officialdata.org/us/inflation/1800?amount=1)

Most  money is already digital. It's just a database in your bank's servers that has names associated with amounts. Less than 10% of the money  supply exists as cash. It would be impossible for everyone to convert  their electronic deposits into cash. Banks actually create even more money when they make loans.[Reserve requirements were suspended](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/reservereq.htm) in the COVID era meaning banks could create unlimited amounts of loans with no reserves at all. And what happened? The value of the Dollar tanked, of course. As it will continue to do once they start the money printer up again, once they get past the threat of higher than normal inflation.

This is stuff you would learn in an intro Economics class. But it's very fundamental to understanding why any currency has value, or loses its  value. Money derives its value from being something that is: fungible,  durable, divisible, portable, and limited in supply. The more of these  properties it has, the better it is as money. It must serve as a unit of  account, a medium of exchange, and a store of value. The better it is  at these things, the better it is as money.

Bitcoin  has all of these qualities, making it useful as money. It's much more  divisible than the Dollar, much  more portable, and more limited in  supply. Since 2013, the Bitcoin network has not had a major outage or hack despite being an extremely high value target. It is free and open source, with out a central authority. So far,  its value has only gone up over the long term despite its high  volatility in the short term.

Limited  supply is essential a currency's potential as a long term store of  value. Many countries have hyperinflated their currencies with  disastrous results. Right now around the world many countries are  experiencing extremely high amounts of inflation. Learn about what has  happened in Argentina, Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Hungary, and many more  countries due to hyperinflation. It's a crisis around the world. Almost  all the world's countries use fiat currency now. Many people in these  countries face authoritarian governments, or do not have access to a  stable currency. Bitcoin has obvious usefulness to these people as well  as anyone else who wants an alternative to fiat money that will do  nothing but lose value over time.",cryptocurrency,1671476826

Bitcoin,Discussion on an ideal economic model for our future,"Do I have the following correct in this hypothetical future?

1. Bitcoin is the medium of exchange and store of value in a country.
2. The vast majority of people just save money since there is no more government-induced inflation. Prices of all goods are relatively stable except in natural disaster situations and supply chain fluctuations.
3. The financial investment industry has shrunk exponentially. There are still people who are investors and provide this expertise for a fee or commission.
4. It is extremely transparent where each Satoshi of your taxes go to. Public entitlement programs are very limited and completely funded as the money supply is almost 100% predictable now. Publicly funded pensions are almost unheard of. There are a lot more private companies providing what were once largely publicly funded services such as public safety.
5. Banks still exist but their business model is more about pooling investor funds and providing a Bitcoin custody service for the people who don't feel comfortable holding their own coins. Bitcoin custodial services are a big deal as personal home robberies are now fairly commonplace. Banks are not required to have a 1:1 reserve ratio, but customers understand that if a bank does not then they may lose their money if something happens to the bank. Banks are nowhere near ""too big to fail"" anymore.
6. People can choose to invest their Bitcoin into various projects to try to multiply their wealth and they understand that they can lose their money if the project fails, end of story.
7. There is a free market for interest rates. Loans are largely sourced from private lenders and/or banks, but there is no more central bank nor a national interest rate decided by a small group of people. 
8. There is still a stock market because companies still have the freedom to try to publicly fund their business ideas, but it's no longer the behemoth that it once was as money is hard money and isn't as easy to come by as it once was.

stocks,Altria Abandons Expiring Cronos Warrant; Maintains Initial Investment,"RICHMOND, Va.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Altria Group, Inc (NYSE:MO) today announced that its wholly owned subsidiary, Altria Summit LLC, has notified Cronos Group Inc. (Cronos) of its irrevocable abandonment of (i) its warrant to purchase additional common shares of Cronos (the Warrant) and (ii) all rights that it may have held in the Warrant or any common shares underlying the Warrant for no consideration.

In March 2019, Altria acquired, through its subsidiaries, a 45% ownership interest in Cronos and the Warrant. The Warrant was exercisable until March 8, 2023 at an exercise price of CAD$19.00 per common share. Prior to abandonment of the Warrant, Altria, through its subsidiaries, owned 156,573,537 common shares of Cronos (representing approximately 41% of the Cronos common shares issued and outstanding) and, by fully exercising the Warrant, could increase its ownership by 84,243,223 Cronos common shares to 240,816,760 Cronos common shares (representing approximately 52% of the Cronos common shares that would be issued and outstanding following full exercise of the Warrant).

The closing share price of Cronos common shares on December 15, 2022 was CAD$3.81 and the Cronos common shares have not traded above CAD$6.00 over the past 12 months. Given the Cronos trading levels and the March 2023 expiry of the Warrant, Altria elected to abandon the Warrant on December 16, 2022. As a result of the Warrant abandonment, Altria expects to claim a capital loss of $483 million on its U.S federal consolidated income tax return for 2022. Altria continues to own 156,573,537 common shares of Cronos.

Altria, through its subsidiaries, holds the Cronos common shares for investment purposes. Altria will continue to evaluate Cronos’s business and prospects and all other factors it deems relevant in determining whether it or its affiliates will acquire additional common shares of Cronos or dispose of common shares of Cronos in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions (which may be with Cronos or with third parties) or otherwise.

My partner and I have a considerable amount of student loan debt... ~ $80,000 USD, split among three loans ($24,600 @ 2.49%, $44,600 @ 3.52%, and ~$10,000 @ ??% - partner's fed loan, haven't really dug to find interest rate).

We recently sold our house and are currently staying with family, which has afforded us about $100k cash. Both of us want to be out of debt. But we also don't want to put ourselves in a position where we find a house we like, and can't put much/any money down. We are looking at houses that are in the low 200k ball park, but are willing to bring that down if it means paying off debt/investing better in the future. Between mortgage interest rates, inflation, the market, no interest/fees on the fed loan, etc. I have no idea what to do. Although I will say, being totally debt free would be **super** nice. Combined salary is about $110k gross. 

Anyone ever pay off their student loans in a lump sum? Was the weight lifted worth it?

Thanks!!",finance,1671486601

Until recently I only had an Amex card, now I also have a Chase card for travel rewards.  I thought conventional wisdom was that a high credit score means low interest rates on loans, etc.  Why then is my rate at Chase 23.74%? Is that a rate typical for someone with good credit? If it is, I can't imagine the rate for someone below 700. Yeowsa.

Bonus question, I retired earlier this year.  I'm noticing Chase and Amex are both asking for my income.  Since I'm living off of savings and investments, my income is 0 (especially with the current stock market). If I answer their queries with $0, will my credit score drop?",finance,1671488803
personalfinance,Local government job offer negotiation - advice please,"I'm looking for advice from those who have had experience negotiating salary upon a job offer at local government in the US. (I'm in California, if it matters.)

This is the first time I've been going through the process for local (city) government employment. I got a call from HR last week letting me know what position they wanted to offer me and which step in the salary schedule they wanted to pay me. I tried not to be too final about anything and thought I'd wait until I get the conditional offer via email before trying to negotiate. One thing that concerns me is that the HR person was like, ""Great, I'm glad you accepted our conditional offer!"" when I was just trying to keep it open and let her know that I would wait to see the email before making any decisions.

Per protocol, I have to go in and do the background check and a physical test before being sent the conditional offer, I guess. I've been reading up on negotiating government salary upon a job offer and some federal government advice says that waiting for the offer is too late to negotiate. Did I wait too long? I can't even do the background check until next week due to holiday closures but I really wanted to at least try to negotiate for the next pay step.

personalfinance,Best Personal or Debt Consolidation Loans,"Hi All,

I'm currently exploring personal and debt consolidations loans to lower my current monthly payments and lower my interest rates.

I'm considering a loan anywhere between $25-$30k. The loans stem from a few I took out to help with expenses during grad school, cover some expenses during a period of unemployment and, during C19.  I don't have much in the way of credit card debt and would use the extra money to pay that off or hopefully get offers for zero interest balance transfers, as I'm not planning to use the loan towards the credit cards.

My credit is in the mid to high 600s and I earn low six figures but live in a high COL area.  I still have a lot to learn about money, which is why I'm here.  Again, my goal is to lower my monthly payments and use the extra money to pay off credit cards and/or invest in some other way.

personalfinance,Employer Didn't Withhold Enough Taxes on Bonus,"I've been working with my company for several years now as a W-2 employee. I've been fortunate enough to receive a sizable end of year bonus each year that is around 20% of my annual salary. In previous years, around 45% of my bonus has been withheld for tax purposes (state of California and federal). My refunds are usually on the order of a few hundred dollars, so this seems to be about right. This year, I received an even larger bonus than previous years, and yet only 12% of my bonus was withheld for tax purposes despite my tax status not changing. I brought it up with both my manager and the person in charge of payroll and both say unfortunately they can't go back and take out more taxes. The payroll person is also adamant that they did not make a mistake, despite my year-to-date tax percentage being significantly lower than previous years while making a higher gross salary. I can calculate roughly how much I'll owe come tax time and make sure I keep that cash on hand, but I'm worried the small amount of withholding could result in an under-withholding penalty with the IRS. Is this something to be concerned about, and if so what can I do to prevent paying a penalty? Thanks.",finance,1671496791
stocks,Who really caused inflation? Biden? Powell? Trump? Xi? Putin?,"It seems on top of the money printing that Powell did, there were a lot of reasons that the inflation is persisting.

1. One of the person that people point fingers to is Powell - 2 years of 0 interest rate, massive buying of bonds. That certainly spiked the money flow.

2. One can also blame Putin because it’s the Ukraine conflict that gave a huge bump to the gas price, making inflation (food and energy, specifically) way higher and more sticky than the Fed likes. 

3. Another compounding reason for inflation was the Shanghai shutdown for the better part of 3 months. So many businesses were hit with the possibility of not getting their parts, leading to massive spikes in components and materials, leading to a lot of inflation in goods.

4. Yet another person to blame would be Trump, and no, it’s not the stimulus. It’s the things he has done to the immigration system. He makes immigration very hard for foreign workers and the policy is proven to be particularly difficult for businesses that want to hire people. They have to compete for good workers and keep them with higher salary.

5. And at last, it could be said it was Biden’s fault - because it happened on his watch. Biden did release a lot of oil reserves (like half of all the reserve), but the administration’s failure to reach diplomatic solutions before the Ukraine conflict (especially Blinken) is more or less relevant to the inflation predicament we are in.

But I think it’s probably a compounding effect of all of their actions that resulted in this situation. It’s unfortunate that poor people have to pay so much for the basic needs. But it’s also unfortunate for people whose portfolio got hit a lot - plus high interest rate is inherently bad for the US’s future because the Us’s leadership is fundamentally a leadership in technology, and advances in technology requires risk taking, growth and low interest rate.

Lessons to be learned:
1. Peace and trade benefits everyone.
2. Gutting your immigration system while you rely on immigration is a horrible idea.",finance,1671499707

Forex,Questions for fundamental traders,"I’ve always been quite perplexed with implementation of fundamental analysis. I generally understand macroeconomics, observing GDP, unemployment, trade deficits and inflation and how it can affect the economy as well as economic indicators and the immediate reactions they can cause in the market.

However I’ve always struggled to understand how fundamental traders take their knowledge of events or strength in economies and translate it to a trade idea on the charts.

There are a myriad of economic influences that could affect pairs. Of course interest rate speculation tends to be a significant driver of price. But when news events come out it can be difficult to process them and then understand how the market is likely to react, then react before they do. Also, if you’ve watched market reactions to news events you’ll know that they are quite unpredictable at times and you can get whipsawed trading short term news like NFP or FOMC.

- Is fundamental analysis relevant for short term traders (holding trades under a week)

- How do you translate your analysis to the charts and trade decisions?

- if you use technicals how do you incorporate then into your fundamental analysis?

- Is there any use in speculating over fundamentals and following economies closely instead as opposed to having a general view or a purely technical view?

(Currently I generally like to maintain a broad view of fundamentals and I stay aware of important news events. I’m also aware of how they may affect price in theory but I don’t use news for my trade decisions)",finance,1671505386

personalfinance,How can I better manage my money today?,"Hi all, I am currently 24, and I like to think I am pretty fiscally savvy, but I'm always looking to improve and for more advice. So right now, I'm not sure what else I can do today.

I currently live in a HCOL city, however, I technically work remotely, so I am flexible in regards to location. I currently have a mortgage on a 600k condo, and some other details about my situation:

* I make about 150k annually pre-tax and bonuses
* About 30k saved up in a high interest rate savings
* I am contributing 15% to 401k and maxing out my contribution limits and employer match, with about 120k saved up so far
* I have about 130k in stocks spread across stocks, ETFs, company stock, and bonds
* I also max out my HSA and have been reinvesting 70% of it as well

I am wondering if I might be better served, selling off the house or renting it out, and moving to a lower cost of living city. I have a 15 year mortgage with payments roughly around $3000/month right now, which is about equal to the asking rate of rent for my area. If I moved to a LCOL city, I could probably save at least $1500 to $2000/month on housing. If I was to sell it off today, I have about 400k left on the mortgage.

The one caveat is that moving to a lower COL city would mean a reduction in salary proportional to that city's COL. In addition, I currently have no state income tax, which is a big plus imo, however the city and municipal taxes are decently high. From what I read online, the salary could drop anywhere between 10 to 20% depending on the city.

Is this move worth considering and/or is there anything else I should be doing to better manage my money?",finance,1671506527
Banking,[US][AlaskaUSA Federal Credit Union] Direct deposit into invalid account nearly a month ago; still unresolved,"Background: Wife started working somewhere new in August. We had **one** successful direct deposit from them (first paycheque) but every subsequent time her employment portal would wipe all the payment election information and revert back to physical cheques, which was fine because at least we were getting them, continuously reentered the routing number and account numbers. This led to us accidentally entering the wrong information which wasn't discovered until tonight.

After 4 months of physical checks despite our payment elections, it finally deposited electronically on November 23rd into an invalid account. AlaskaUSA's account numbers are 13 digit and we provided a 15 digit. Which is strange because we had multiple tellers and even the branch manager cross reference the information we provided in the employment portal to the numbers printed on a blank cheque. I quadruple checked with multiple employees because those cheques are kind of hard to read and I suspected that we were the ones that made a mistake. I just want to make this very clear because it wasn't only our mistake. We had five sets of eyes on it and we all made the same mistake.

Employer claims the money hit the institution with no ACH rejection. Bank says it absolutely did not hit any account as it's a completely invalid format (15 characters versus 13 characters) and should have automatically rejected. Problem is, this happened nearly a month ago and every post I'm seeing on here indicates that this should have automatically been rejected *within a matter of days* and my banking institution said the same thing.

Employer doesn't have direct access to ACH tracing number. We've been waiting for a trace number from her employer's payment processor for over two weeks. 

**tl;dr** - buggy web portal led to us making a mistake which went undiscovered until tonight, employer not really advocating for us on their end to get it taken care of and we're stuck waiting for an ACH tracing number from a third party to figure out wtf happened

Any advice would be greatly appreciated. What is the likelihood that we'll receive this paycheque if it essentially disappeared into the ether? What can we do to expedite this and make sure it doesn't take another month to get paid? Thank you.",finance,1671508299
stocks,"Legit game changer tonight: BOJ surprises with yield cap adjustment; S&amp;P futures tank, US/Japan yields &amp; Yen surge higher","TOKYO – Bank of Japan (BOJ) Governor Haruhiko Kuroda shocked markets by adjusting the central bank’s yield curve control program and sparking a sharp jump in the yen just months before he is due to step down.

The BOJ will now allow Japan’s 10-year bond yields to rise to around 0.5 per cent, up from the previous upper limit of 0.25 per cent on its movement range, according to its policy statement Tuesday. 

The central bank kept its target for the yield unchanged at around zero percent. It also left its short-term interest rate at -0.1 per cent.

All 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expected no policy change, though most of them had said the bank should do more to improve the functioning of the bond market.

**The surprise decision has the potential to jolt global financial markets as the BOJ’s steadfast commitment to defending its 10-year yield cap has served as an anchor indirectly helping keep borrowing costs low around the world.**

The yen strengthened to as much as 133.21 against the dollar, compared with 137.16 immediately before the announcement.

A further firming of the yen would help reduce the cost-push inflation weighing on domestic-oriented businesses and households as Kishida picks Kuroda’s successor in the coming months. 

The governor had repeatedly stuck to a resolutely dovish stance by stressing the need for stimulus until stronger wage growth takes place, ruling out the possibility the BOJ will take action against the yen’s slump. 

In the runup to the BOJ gathering, speculation had been growing over the likely direction of policy after Kuroda steps down. 

Prime Minister Fumio Kishida is planning on revising a decade-old accord with the BOJ and will consider adding flexibility to the agreement’s 2 per cent price goal, local media reported over the weekend. The reports came after a key aide to Kishida told Bloomberg earlier this month that there is a possibility of reaching a new accord with the central bank.  

The yield on 10-year government debt remained unchanged at the BOJ’s cap of 0.25 per cent after the decision. 

The governor will elaborate on the BOJ’s views on policy and inflation at a press briefing.

personalfinance,Mother getting herself into debt,"Hi all,

Tldr: what happens when credit card debt gets into the millions?

My mother and father split up a number of years ago. Father was a private practice doctor. My parents would would spend about $800k a year, $100k of which would be from my dad and $700k from my mom.

Now they are divorced and my mom is spending 40K+ a month still, which is fine for now but will be far from sustainable in the next 5 or so years, with no sense of personal finance. I was with her three days ago and she spent $4k in Bergdorfs on clothing she later said she didn’t even like. 

I have tried to approach the subject around money but she gets incredibly defensive and informs me she uses an advisor. The primary issues are:

1. My mom is a compulsive liar and gets defensive when asked about things, especially money. Everything I know I discovered one day by snooping because I was fed up with the lies

2. She is addicted to spending money and buying strangers luxury gifts (which is nice but she has zero knowledge of the value of a dollar and is spending how she always has)

3. She pays the monthly minimum on her credit cards instead of the statement balances and doesn’t understand why that’s bad. She also has 300%+ utilization on some cards which does seem predatory 

Essentially, my mom is wrapping herself up in credit card debt and will not pay off those bills despite being able to. Eventually this will snowball out of control. I fear that in the future she will require money so she’s not homeless at this rate but anything I give her will just be burned on luxury goods and I’d rather her save now with the high alimony payments.

My question is this: what happens when the debt gets out of control? It is my understanding a decent amount of these situations are actually not so hard to get out of from a legal/collections perspective but just how screwed would she be if she had $2M+ in credit card debt and couldn’t pay? She is currently burning the candle at both ends by overspending and being charged interest on past balances.

Thanks in advance!

Edit: Thank you all for your replies! Never thought I would be in this position but these things happen. If anything, this just confirmed my belief not to enable her and to distance myself from her/the situation if she does not want my help.

vet,My puppy passed away rather bizzarely this morning.,"So, I had this little stray puppy that adopted me. I had brought it to the vet on saturday for his first vaccin. Everything was fine yesterday, he was playing, had his food and was behaving like any other puppy.

Even this morning, before leaving for work, I fed the little guy and he cleaned his bowl sparkling clean! However, just before leaving, I heard him cry like something really bad had happened. I dropped everything to go see him and there I saw him lying down with his right hind leg spasming. He passed away in less that 5 minutes.

I am still in shock as to how that happened. I have another 4 puppies who are 2 months old and ngl, I'm anxious for their health and safety.

Can anyone help me shed some light on what might have happened, please?

vet,Urgent help needed for my dying 18 year old cat with liver &amp; kidney problems,"A week ago my cat couldn’t eat or drink anything for 2 days and started throwing up so we took her to the vet. They found in the blood work that she has severe kidney and liver problems, so they gave me a bunch of pills to force feed her in the hopes that she’d get better. After 2 days of medicating and IV fluid, her kidneys felt smaller and her temperature went from 35 degrees Celsius to 36. But right after that she stopped being able to swallow the medication, she stopped being able to eat the food we spoon fed her, she stopped drinking water and her temperature dropped to 33 degrees. Now she can’t walk at all and will refuse any food or water, physically can’t swallow, and it looks like she’s just lying down, waiting to die. 

I’ve put her in her in a quiet corner in my room with low lighting. She’s in her carrier on top of a big fluffy pillow and I’ve put her under a blanket with 2 tiny heat packs. I’ve also been dripping into her mouth Rescue Remedy for pets, rubbed CBD balm all over her body (she seems like she’s in pain) and I injected a painkiller from the vet. 

Can you please give me your best advice on this matter?

And is pouring water into her mouth with a syringe a bad idea, or is it worse to let her get progressively more dehydrated?

Please let me know any advice you have ASAP, I’m really worried for my kitty. 🥺",cryptocurrency,1671541032
stocks,(12/20) Tuesday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News,"#Good morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to Tuesday! Here are your pre-market stock movers &amp; news on this Tuesday, December the 20th, 2022-

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as Wall Street’s struggles continue](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/19/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures wavered Tuesday, whipsawing after an announcement from the Bank of Japan as traders fear a year-end rally may not come to fruition.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 5 points, or 0.02%, having earlier been down more than 200 points. S&amp;P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.17% and 0.42%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The Dow on Monday shed more than 162 points, or about 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.9%, and the Nasdaq Composite lost nearly 1.5%. Stocks are on track to end the month and the year in the red, and investors’ hopes for a Santa Claus rally are fading fast.
*****
&gt; “There’s still no Santa sighting. Buckle up,” said Louis Navellier, founder of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates. “One would like to think all the bad news is in. There are no more Fed moves until February at the earliest. We’re not gapping down but certainly not clawing back last week’s losses.”
*****
&gt; Fears that the Federal Reserve could tip the economy into a recession plagued investors. Last week, the central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points and policymakers indicated the terminal rate could rise as high as 5.1%.
*****
&gt; Other central banks in hawkish mode put further pressure on traders, with the European Central Bank raising rates and its outlook for further hikes last week. Overnight on Tuesday, the Bank of Japan moved to widen its cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield, catching traders around the world off guard.
*****
&gt; “Over 90% of central banks have hiked interest rates this year, making the (mostly) global coordinated effort unprecedented” said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial. “The good news? We think we’re close to the end of these rate hiking cycles, which could lessen the headwind we’ve seen on global financial markets this year.”
*****
&gt; A handful of big companies will report their quarterly results this week ahead of the Christmas holiday. General Mills will report before the bell Tuesday. Nike and FedEx are set to report after the bell.
*****
&gt; In economic data, housing starts data for November are due Tuesday morning. This week promises lots of insight into the housing industry. Sales data for existing homes and new homes will be released Wednesday and Friday, respectively.
*****
&gt; November’s personal consumption expenditures report, a preferred measure of inflation for the Fed, is due on Friday.

investing,My company is interviewing for a new 401k provider and have asked me to sit in on the demos and help them make a final decision. What questions should I ask?,"I work at a smallish company (&lt;200 employees) and our current 401k provider is pretty abysmal. Specifically the investment options are lacking with only 1 index fund being available and at a high expense ratio. No target date funds available either.

I reached out to HR to see if we could request more options and they said they'd look into it for me. A month or so later they decided to find a new provider altogether and since I showed an interest they've asked me to sit in on the demos for the 2 finalists they've narrowed it down to and help them make a decision.

I'm thrilled that they're giving me the opportunity to do so but want to make sure I come prepared so what kind of questions should I ask? What features should I look for?


**EDIT:**

Here's what I've got so far:


1. Fees. What do you charge the company, what do you charge the employees? Are there fees for selling, reallocating?
2. How readily visible are fees for each offering? Employees should be able to easily compare.
3. Make sure there are Low-Cost Index Fund and Target Date Retirement Options. Are there diverse set of actively managed options as well? What are the expense ratios on these items? How do these offerings compare to your retail customers?
4. Self Service for employees to change contribution limits
5. What’s the window on when an employee can change their contribution amount to have it take effect for the next pay period?
6. Can employees future date contribution % changes?
7. Are contributions only % or can employees specify an amount?
8. Option to exclude bonuses from contributions?
9. Are there automatic cutoffs for hitting the federal limit? Does this accout for employees over the age of 50?
10. What if employee joins midyear and has contributions from other provider? Can the employee indicate their previous contributions for the year for an automatic cutoff?
11. Are Roth contributions available?
12. Are after-tax contributions available?
13. Are in service distributions available, specifically to an employee's roth IRA at another broker?
14. What about in plan conversions from after-tax to Roth 401k? If so can they be automatic?
15. Is a company match catchup at end of the year available if an employee hits the federal max before year end?
16. If an employee leaves the company are they required to close out their account? If not, are there account maintenance fees for former employees? If they do close, is there a fee to do so?
17. Do you have in-kind transfers out for former employees who are closing their account?
18. Do you accept in-kind transfers in for new employees rolling in existing 401ks?
19. Do you support employees borrowing from their 401k?
20. When retirement hits, what are the payout options? Lump sum, monthly paycheck, blended?

stocks,Wells Fargo agrees to $3.7 billion settlement with Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over consumer abuses,"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/wells-fargo-agrees-to-3point7-billion-settlement-with-cfpb-over-consumer-abuses.html

Wells Fargo agreed to a $3.7 billion settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau over customer abuses tied to bank accounts, mortgages and auto loans, the regulator said Tuesday. The bank was ordered to pay a $1.7 billion civil penalty and “more than $2 billion in redress to consumers,” the CFPB said in a statement. In a separate statement, the San Francisco-based company said that many of the “required actions” tied to the settlement were already completed. “The bank’s illegal conduct led to billions of dollars in financial harm to its customers and, for thousands of customers, the loss of their vehicles and homes,” the agency said in its release. “Consumers were illegally assessed fees and interest charges on auto and mortgage loans, had their cars wrongly repossessed, and had payments to auto and mortgage loans misapplied by the bank.”

The resolution lifts one overhang for the bank, which has been led by CEO Charlie Scharf since October 2019. Last year, the bank told investors that it was “likely to experience issues or delays” in satisfying demands from its multiple U.S. regulators. Then, in October, the bank set aside $2 billion for legal, regulatory and customer remediation matters, igniting speculation that a settlement was nearing. But other regulatory hurdles remain: Wells Fargo is still operating under consent orders tied to its 2016 fake accounts scandal, including one from the Fed that caps its asset growth.

Furthermore, the bank said fourth-quarter expenses would include a $3.5 billion operating loss, or $2.8 billion after taxes, from the incremental costs of the CFPB civil penalty and customer remediation efforts, as well as other legal matters. The bank is still expected to post an overall profit when it reports in mid-January, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said Wells Fargo’s “rinse-repeat cycle of violating the law” hurt millions of American families and that the settlement was an “important initial step for accountability” for the bank.",finance,1671549560
bonds,treasury maturities' rate - reasons for movement?,"learning here so apologies for the multiple (and sometimes obtuse) questions but is there a good way for noobs to think about treasury rates' movement?
for instance the 1 year rate seems like it has held pretty steady? 
i mean i do get that the treasuries tend historically to be very static but this year obviously they have had relatively 'wild' swings?
is there any relation between treasury yields and stock market performance one way or the other?
is it ""simply"" that demand for a particular stock on the secondary market pushes yields down? and that rising fed interest rates pushes it up slightly? or does higher fed rates sometimes push yields down? i guess for some reason i keep thinking rising fed rates will push yields up but i guess this is not the case?
also i don't quite understand how the yields on primary market affect yields on the secondary market and/or vice versa?
lastly, do ""political or economic shocks"" almost always push yields down?

My monthly scheduled payment is $530, but I always pay an extra $700 that is applied just to principal. Since the interest rate is so low, sometimes I wonder why I'm rushing to pay off the mortgage so quickly when I could be investing that extra $700 (or at least $500 of it) monthly in mutual funds. 

Curious to hear what people think about one approach vs. the other. My ultimate goal is to get to a place where I can retire around age 60, which makes me think that extra money that I had been applying toward principal on my mortgage would be better off being invested in mutual funds, but are there any benefits to quickly paying off a house other than peace of mind and not having a mortgage payment anymore?",finance,1671552654

personalfinance,disbursement from LLC and taxes,"My spouse is a passive member of a family partnership setup ages ago by her father and now the LLC is starting to be liquidated piece by piece. They've sold off the first property and we unexpectedly got a healthy sized check in the mail recently, about $75K.

I'm trying to estimate how much we need to hold back for taxes. 

My crude understanding is as follows:

This was a property that was held for more than one year so it should be subject to the long term capital gains rates:

+our regular taxable household income
-standard deduction
+$75k disbursement
= total taxable income

Anything part of the $75k check between our regular taxable income minus the deduction and the first $83,350 capital gains tax bracket is taxed at 0% and then the remainder is taxed at 15% and not the normal tax bracket rates...?

So plugging in some rough round numbers:

+$80000 household income  
-$25900 standard deduction  
=$54100   

+$83350 first bracket  
-$54100  
=$29250 in the first capital gains 0% bracket  

+$75000  
-$29250  
=$45750 in the second 15% bracket  

so we should owe the fed about $6800 in taxes on that check, correct? And another ~$3500 for the state (5%)

Once we get this year's tax statement from them we can fine tune things but that should pretty much cover the worst case, right? Or, m I missing something big here?",finance,1671554311
Bitcoin,"What if the US Federal Government attacked Bitcoin with a ""throughput attack""? As in, clog up all the transaction throughput with a bunch of ""dummy"" transactions, in order to slow down the network and thus discourage it's usage?","Here's how it would work:  They print a couple billion dollars.  They buy a million hardware wallets.  Each wallet buys a few hundred thousand sats.  Then an army of bureaucrats sends the sats back and forth to each others' wallets over and over again, producing far more than 7 transactions per second.  And that's all those bureaucrats do all day - it's their job.  And they could then afford to attach super-uber-crazy high fees to each transaction, say $5(worth of sats) per transaction, essentially ""crowding out"" anyone who wants to use the Bitcoin network to send their own transactions.  

It would drive the fees sky high, through the roof.  Which would cause most ordinary people, to be turned off from using Bitcoin.  If they kept this up for a few years, it would stifle the network and no one would want to use it.  Because you'd have to compete with those high fees, which are artificially driven up by governmental action.  

It really seems to me, that this could be the MOST effective way for the government to attack Bitcoin.  With just a couple billion $ (which is a drop in the bucket for the US govt, hell Powell could crank that out in a keystroke), they could make EVERY fee for an entire year be $5 (more likely FAR higher).  

Seriously.  7 transactions/second = about 221 million/year.  So for a little over a billion $, they could make the fees be at least $5 on each transaction.  Making it prohibitively expensive to use the network for any small transactions.

I've never given various insurance much thought as I'm a renter but planning to buy in a house in a few months for $3-3500/mo.

It seems like it may be worthwhile, but I'm skeptical on if they actually pay or not, since it is an insurance company, and paying me for life seems unlikely..

IRS calculator says with using just the standard deduction were going to owe about $11,200 in taxes. Obviously a huge shock to us. Our adjusted combined is about 380k this year, we both had significant raises this year at new jobs, our net combined last year was 240k.

Our tax liability says its going to be $85,596 and we've withheld $74,430. Kind of a shock, we've always withheld as ""Married"" and 0 deductions. Last year we owed only about $700 and our total liability was about $52,000 so we've paid the total we paid last year.

So, here's the deal. I stumbled upon this mega-great business opportunity to open a burger&amp;snacks/bar in a new family and sports center that's being built. My business plan got picked out of several other people that also competed to get the contract and it's fair to say, I'm thrilled and over the roof at the moment. The project is being built by the local municipal office and the contract terms for the first 2 years are very good. 

But here is the dilemma that I'm facing... The business is taking place about 20 kilometers (aprox. 12 miles) away from our house.
We moved into the house in 2018 and our mortgage isn't that high because we just caught the last train with the low interest rates...

I am seriously considering selling the house and moving closer to the business and that's for several reasons, but the biggest one is the kids (5, 9, 12 years old), so the whole logistics behind the family chores would be somewhat easier and not so much time consuming.

The other solution that comes to mind is also the possibility of renting the house. The region we live in is a somewhat good tourist destination and it could also be a good solution.

I've been working in hospitality for all my life, I know my way around these things but I'm just kind of stuck on this.

Chase has some reasonably good credit cards.

Bank of America has complicated Preferred Rewards tiers. You can turn its credit card into the highest general cash back card at 2.625%, but it requires $100k in BoA at terrible rates and/or invested with Merrill, which is an okay brokerage.

personalfinance,Rolling over American Funds 403(b) (mixed asset types) to Vanguard - some questions,"Hello, 

I have approximately $70k in an American Funds 403(b) account. Account is from an employer that I left in mid-2022. Approximately 75% of that money is from after-tax (Roth) contributions I made over the course of my employment. The other 25% in there is from the employer's discretionary/profit-sharing plan (not a match). I spoke with American Funds' rollover folks last week and confirmed these employer contributions are pre-tax (although perhaps that's standard and wasn't worth verifying). In any event, the employer portion is fully vested. 

My new employer does not currently have a great 403(b) option (nor is there any match or discretionary/profit sharing portion). Instead I chose to set up a new Roth IRA with Vanguard (which I have maxed out for 2022). I want to roll my American Funds money over to Vanguard and have clicked through the first few prompts on both websites to see what the process looks like. It looks like Vanguard will let me roll the Roth/Traditional accounts over separately, but American Funds' website only has options for rolling both amounts into (a) a Roth IRA or (b) An IRA or retirement plan at another company. There is technically a third option to roll the pre-tax amounts into a Traditional IRA, but that process (a) requires me to complete a paper form with my former employer (rather than going through the website); and (b) looks like it will result in both a traditional &amp; Roth IRA [being opened with American Funds](https://pr.retire.americanfunds.com/pdf/broker/editable/rpdrfm-001_rollira.pdf) (rather than being rolled over to Vanguard). 

So, I am inclined to rollover both the pre and after-tax money into my Roth IRA at Vanguard using American Funds' website. Once I select that option, it gives me a warning about getting taxed on the pre-tax portion and gives me the option to withhold a percentage of the Traditional amount for federal and state taxes. 

My questions (finally!):

1. I have seen a number of posts here asking about withholding the taxes in the traditional 401(k) --&gt; Roth IRA context, and the general consensus seems to be ""don't withhold or you'll get hit by a 10% penalty because it's considered an early withdrawal."" Should I follow that advice given that my current account is a mix of pre/after tax assets?
2. If I do rollover both assets to my Roth IRA at Vanguard--and I don't withhold--how do I pay those  taxes? I am assuming the answer is that American Funds will send me a 1099 and I'll pay when I file taxes, but I thought I'd double check. 
3. Am I better off trying to split the rollover into two separate IRAs depending on asset type? Again, American Funds has this option but it appears to require both IRAs to remain with American Funds, rather than allowing for two separate accounts at Vanguard. 
4. Does it matter if I get this done this calendar year vs. waiting until next year?
5. Are there other things I should be thinking about?

Possibly relevant things: 33M, Illinois resident, unmarried, income is $90k (although it's less than that this year due to gap between jobs/salary bump at new gig). Will likely continue to work at nonprofits/in government for the rest of my career, but expect salary to continue to grow given my background/line of work.",finance,1671563230
Bitcoin,Bitcoin Exchange Standard,"Bitcoin maxis love the idea of Bitcoin becoming a widely used as a “deflationary currency”, and it is often compared to gold as a store of value. Let’s look at the history of the gold standard as a comparison - specifically the departure from the gold standard. 

Leading up to and after WWII, the gold standard was swapped for the Bretton Woods System until it was erased by Nixon in the early 70’s. Executive order 6102, enacted under FDR, required all Americans to submit their gold to the Federal Reserve Bank. After the war, the 1944 Bretton Woods Agreement signified a change in the global system, in which all countries in the agreement were required to “guarantee convertibility of their currencies into U.S Dollars… with the dollar convertible to gold bullion for foreign governments and central banks at $35 per troy oz” (wikipedia). This means all countries exchange for U.S dollars backed by redeemable gold, but that gold is only redeemable by banks and governments, not your average citizen. 

Now my question is highly theortecial: what if the U.S. enacted a similar order for Bitcoin in the wake of a collapsing global market, and it was made illegal for citizens to hold bitcoin. The government pinning the value of the dollar at a certain number of satoshis. There would be a branch of the federal reserve devoted to mining, rogue mining operations would be highly illegal, and other countries would compete for maximum mining outputs. This would have dramatic effects on the development of the cryptocurrency industry, and on the world. There would be many negatives and positives. What do you think?

Correct my line of thinking here if it is incorrect please:

Yields are higher therefore price is lower and vice versa.

We could buy some of these funds right now at a discount and earn a decent yield while interest rates are elevated. 

When interest rates go back down, won't the price of these funds go up?

So if the above is true, investing in these funds now is a pretty low risk bet right? I guess the main risk here is interest rates continuing to rise dropping the price further or rates staying stagnant for a while ya?

It looks like there is a connection between the Trump NFTs and a serial rugpuller. Below, I've broken down the TRUMPCOIN rug pull; however, there are several more rug-pulled tokens with the exact same pattern by a wallet connected to the TRUMPCOIN incident.

5. 0xae...1f7810 [sells](https://etherscan.io/tx/0xb0c91e9c299d55e0c836b280884a55eb3abf27b2946eaaefc99684ddec1a5c7f) 1 billion TRUMPCOIN for \~5.4 ETH, draining the available liquidity by selling tokens they had [never purchased](https://etherscan.io/token/0x1eb1af0ba1790ca9449c58a70bc196b6e5d901ae?a=0xAe011663CA3a54Ecb7C63796E52B57073C1F7810) on the market.
6. The liquidity pool now sits at $5, effectively preventing the trading of TRUMPCOIN.

So, in short, a new TRUMPCOIN token was created with the initial liquidity indirectly provided by the same address that created the Trump NFT collection. The TRUMPCOIN token's liquidity was later drained by a sale from a wallet that never purchased any of the tokens on the market.

Stocks are edging higher on Wall Street, while bond markets around the world feel pain Tuesday after a surprise move from Japan’s central bank cranked up the pressure on an already slowing global economy.

The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.1% after flipping between small losses and gains in the early going. If the benchmark index closes higher, it will break a four-day losing streak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 80 points, or 0.2%, at 32,835, as of 3:07 p.m. Eastern time, while the Nasdaq composite was down 0.1% after earlier erasing an drop of 0.9%.

Small company stocks were holding up better than the broader market, pushing the Russell 2000 index 0.6% higher.

“It was a surprise, a very unexpected move, but on its own it’s probably not enough to really be a risk-off event for markets,” said Ross Mayfield, investment strategist at Baird.

The biggest action was in the bond market, where yields pushed higher after one of the world’s last bastions of super-low and economy-aiding interest rates made moves that could allow rates to climb more than otherwise.

personalfinance,"529/Brokerage Investing for first child, looking for some advice","We plan on saving our Federal Child Tax Credit every year and dumping it into our (unborn) daughters 529,since we don’t need that money to live,and it makes sense to do so, since we are only getting that money because of her, we want it to go to her future.

&amp;#x200B;

Using Vanguard’s college cost calculator, with an estimated increase of 7%(statistically has  averaged 5%, but I’m a pessimist)every year, tuition,fees,and books will cost $125,000 for four years at a state school here in CA(currently costs $30K for just tuition,fees,and books). 

&amp;#x200B;

The 529 has a current balance of $1000, and if $3600/yr is deposited over 18 years, with an average return of 7%, that is (strangely enough) $125K. 

&amp;#x200B;

I don’t expect to need the entire amount, as she would most likely go to a community college the first two years, because there is no point in paying more for the same education. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, with all of this in mind, would it make sense to take any extra money that we want to set aside for her, and invest it into a Brokerage account in ETFs(VTI/VXUS), so when she hits adulthood we can help her buy a car,down payment on a house,or maybe even a modest wedding?",finance,1671586608

vet,Anal glands need expressing every 5-7 days,"Hi all, I’m posting here hoping to get answers. I have a 14month old spayed golden doodle, she’s healthy and happy, the only thing is that she needs her glands expressed because they do in fact get full about every 5-10 days (though lately it’s every 7 days now). 

She’s had this issue ever since she was about 4 months old. We’ve eliminated all treats, chews, and now are trying different protein formulas in her food. She’s been on dry kibble since weaning. I’ve fed her the canned chicken and boiled rice a few times if she’s had diarrhea, but go back to dry kibble when she’s stabilized. She was on chicken kibble but I just switched to salmon to see if it was a sensitivity to chicken (she gets diarrhea if she has turkey products. 

She has only ever had 1 ear infection about 4 months ago, she does scratch here and there but not excessively. She doesn’t chew her paw pads much but will on occasion. 

We tried apoquel for 6 months but it had no impact on the glands. We tried Benadryl also, no impact, she still needed them expressed just as often, so I took her off both. Only medication she gets is simparico trio once monthly, she’s been on that since 9 weeks old. We also tried glandex for 6 months, it had no impact on the glands either, always needing expression at least twice a month, usually more. 

Her poops are mostly solid, very pickupable until the end and they get a little softer but still pickupable. According to two different vets at Banfield, her glands are a normal size and also in the right place for typically expression during pooping. 

She was on some Sams club brand food as a pup, then switched to blue buffalo life protection. Tried nulo but it gave her diarrhea so I switched to Simply Nourish then to Authority (vet techs recommendation). All these were chicken formula kibble until Authority when I went to salmon and rice, and none have improved her gland situation. 

She gets the recommended food amount for her size (34lbs, maybe 18-ish inches at the shoulder), she’s not overweight, she eats in the am and pm, and poops 1-3 times a day. 

The vets at Banfield have no answers since her anatomy suggests they should express fine. 

Has anyone ever heard of this before where the glands needed expressing this often? How did it get remedied? Please help.",cryptocurrency,1671588871

Eg will they get a worse interest rate on the second loan?",finance,1671590176
personalfinance,Should we file bankruptcy?,"Hi everyone, we are considering filing Bankruptcy, as we have been unable to get approved for debt consolidation loans or personal loans to lessen our monthly expenses. With medical payment plans and only paying the minimum on credit cards (that we wracked up mostly medical debt, car repairs, and food/necessary expenses on) we are in a deficit of about $200/month. While this is easy enough to cover with a part-time job, we are over $130,000 in debt and although more than half of this would not be discharged in bankruptcy (student loans and cars), it is very likely we would be in a much better situation in 7 years if we claimed bankruptcy versus if we did not. We are going to be meeting with a financial advisor, but wanted to hear other peoples views of our situation, first. 

To give a bit of background, I am 27 and just accepted a full-time public school teaching position making $50,000, but will not start until sometime in late January, possibly February depending on how fast the state processes everything. I have been picking up extra shifts babysitting, but am limited because my child's daycare is currently closed for the holidays. However, although I will be making $50,000, due to 7% mandatory retirement contribution, health insurance, taxes AND the fact that my county requires all teachers to spread their pay over 12 months versus 10, I should be taking home roughly 75% of my gross paycheck bi-weekly. We’re estimating that I will be taking home about $2600 per month. 

My husband is 33 and he is working in HR making $60,000 at a startup. Currently, the business is NOT doing very well and he has been told that if the business does not meet certain metrics by the end of Q1 it will shut down. He is bringing home about $4250 per month. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Total Monthly Take Home Pay: $5920 (effective February 2023)

Our expenses:

Rent: $1850 (live right between DC and Baltimore and we literally couldn’t find any 2 BR cheaper)

Daycare: $2000 (We are on waitlists for cheaper in-home centers for when he turns 2. In-homes are roughly $300-$350 per week in my area so in a standard 4 week month, we should be paying about $1200 starting in the summer)

Groceries: $450/month (including all food, cleaning products, diapers, wipes, etc.)

Utilities: Roughly $220 per month (power, water, gas, internet)

Cellphone: $60 ($30 for husband, $30 for me)

Car Insurance: $200

Sallie Mae: $175 per month (Total of $14,000, which I understand would likely NOT get discharged in any form of Bankruptcy)

Federal Loans: $0 per month (currently owe $50,000, PSLF would forgive $17,500 in 5 years OR forgive all of my balance completely within 10 years). 

Health Insurance: $70 (state benefits are awesome and my husband’s job is currently paying 50% of our health insurance). 

My Car Payment: $305 (initial balance $16,000, current balance is about $7,000…Paid off 2025)

Husband’s Car Payment: $405 (initial balance $20,000, current balance is about $16,000…Paid off 2026)

Medical Bills: On payment plans, roughly totaling about $400 per month (had medical issues, about $13,000 total due between surgeon, anesthesia, hospital, etc.) 

Credit Cards: Minimum Payments are a bit over $1000 per month (total of about $30,000 over several different cards between 15%-25% interest. Used credit cards to pay some medical bills, necessary expenses after we depleted savings, moving expenses, daycare tuition, etc. Not much was due to unnecessary expenses, as we try to be very frugal. Interest rates mostly have just been killing us. 

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So, do you think bankruptcy makes sense in our case? We were mainly considering Chapter 13 since we want to keep our cars (MD has an exclusion of $5,000 for personal property and my car has about $6500 in equity). However, I’m really worried about my husband’s job. In the past, he has typically struggled to even get interviews and has been applying to higher-paying positions for months without any success. I’m concerned that if we file for Chapter 13 and he loses his job, we would be unable to afford the payment plan we would agree to. However, once I start working, we would no longer qualify for Chapter 7 (unless he DOES lose his job), but then we wouldn’t have any savings to be able to afford rent/food and we would obviously have no credit lines to put it on.",finance,1671590800

economy,Economics of heated sidewalks,"I recently learned about the system of [heated sidewalks](https://www.holland.org/snow-free-holland) in Holland, Michigan. Underneath the sidewalks there are tubes containing circulating warm water, used to melt snow, so people don't have to salt and shovel. The town power plant generates heat as a byproduct of creating electricity, and this sidewalk system harvests the heat, which would otherwise be lost, to melt snow.

As I understand, the Biden administration is giving a federal grant to install a [similar system](https://www.concordmonitor.com/Berlin-to-use-waste-heat-from-Burgess-BioPower-to-clear-snow-from-streets-sidewalks-47570631) in the town of Berlin, New Hampshire. But it seems that many residents there are skeptical or even outwardly upset about the possibility of heated sidewalks. Apparently a journalist named Jesse Watters has been reporting on how bad heated sidewalks are and how unhappy people in Berlin, New Hampshire are about their grant. Meanwhile, from what I gather, people in Holland, Michigan are happy with the heated sidewalks. Businesses seem to really like it. So maybe the issue is the operating cost or something like that?

So how does a municipality that gets a lot of snow decide if a heated sidewalk makes economic sense for them? I'd imagine they compare estimates of the capital cost and operating cost of a heated sidewalk to the cost of the current snow management system for the sidewalk. Does anyone have a better sense of how this works? Or could someone help me understand why this system is so rare? It seems to me like it would save a lot of labor.",finance,1671591676

Bitcoin,What needs to happen for Bitcoin to become the NEW Monetary system?,"The current currency is not based on anything. So, the dollar bills are basically some fancy printed paper. However, we know Bitcoin is an efficient and fair system based on modern technologies like Blockchain, cryptography, and PoW among others. 

So, the common sense is for Bitcoin to replace the current monetary system. However, I believe this would not be easy as the current monetary system has deep-rooted powerful and influential institutions associated with it. 

What needs to really happen for Bitcoin to take over? Is it just the mass realization? Do the Federal Banks need to just fail and give up? Will a massive global recession due to inflation result in Bitcoin adoption? 

Can anyone enlighten me on this matter? If I have said something wrong here, feel free to educate me. Thanks!",cryptocurrency,1671619597
CryptoCurrency,[SERIOUS] Binance - FUD or not? The truth,"It's been really back and forth on this sub for what feels like weeks now. The term ""FUD"" has been thrown around like it's a word to greet somebody and others predict a binance collapse or are worried about it.

TL;DR: **No Binance will not collapse like FTX.** **No, CZ did not destroy FTX.** **FTX destroyed FTX**. **Higher rates of the FED, nearly 1 year of a bear market and lower liquidity revealed the fraud.** Binance has nothing to do with those shady practises.

On the other hand stop throwing the term FUD at anyone that critizise Binance. Some have valid arguments and just want to help or protect others preventing people from losing money. Without critism events like LUNA, Voyager, Celsius, FTX &amp; BlockFi could've dealt way more damage.

# What's up with Binance

\- 28th November - Binance moving large amounts of BTC around. Everyone screams ""where is the proof of reserve""

https://preview.redd.it/ys1hdc3lg87a1.png?width=828&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c77264f4d0976b321e9322d975c7570a20abe2cb

This topic ignited the whole drama. The Proof-of-Reserve of Binance. The proof they have enough for all users + more left to operate properly. This was the biggest concern since the illiquidity of FTX was one of the major reasons for it's collapse. While everyone was waiting for Binance response - it took some time. Within those weeks people became suspicious especially since CZ himself started tweeting a lot of what feels ""random"" things. It felt like they ignore the issue / problems.

# Binance’s bitcoin reserves are fully collateralized according to auditing firm Mazars

This was a huge step foreward for Binance shutting down most of the allegations around their proof of reserve &amp; liquidity. However, it took them nearly 2 weeks and people became very suspicious already. Now they request more transparency. This time it's their liabilities :

And now it's time - another ""crypto bankrun"" happens. Lots of people get their crypto off Binance. The articles are going around everywhere. The stress-test is happening and peaking : will Binance be able to withhold all the withdraws?**Answer: Yes they did.**

\~6.2BN were withdrawn - \~6.5BN were deposited. All within a single day.

https://preview.redd.it/b5v3q38dj87a1.png?width=1280&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=864a106f97fe8ebbe8818126d674f0b6993469ae

Balance is shrinking partly heavily :

And... it diddn't collapse. To be fair - not everything was withdrawn. I believe the lowest point / maximum withdrawn point was a hit of 11% on their reserve at one point. Does this proof they can handle a 100% withdraw? No. Does this proof Binance is liquid and able to handle a stress test? **Yes.**

Or in other words : Binance worked perfectly fine as the exchange it is supposed to be. And if everyone treats it like that it will be fine for all users. The major issue and problem people saw that Binance will collapse on a stress test has been proven as false. But Binance is massive and it would take a WAY bigger stress test to actually test their entire reserves.

And again - this topic is back on the table. Why did Mazar decide to step down from the Crypto buiseness? Damage control to not hurt their reputation because they aren't able to 100% confirm the audits ? Most likely. Do they know about Binance being super shady, gambling all users funds away? **No lol.**

Yet the effect was huge. This is not just a Binance problem - it's a general crypto problem.

**The fear is back and this was the last major event until today.**

# BNB FUD or real? Most likely FUD.

I genuinly diddn't want to bring up BNB because it has barely anything to do with what's going on with Binance but some might be interested.

**Summarized : BNB is most likely fine** \- it's just a overvalued based on TA. This is all trader talk &amp; topic - nothing big or shady is going on around it. **Skip this part of the thread if you don't care about BNB TA.**

Do I think BNB will go to $0 and collapse? **No. I'm a degenerate trader that sees a potential for gains - that's it.** And please treat me and everyone else about the following topic as such. **This has less to do with Binance and is more a pure trading topic.**

**BNB air pocket &amp; disconnected price movement from BTC during the bear market**

BNB had a couple weeks ago 13% of the market cap of Bitcoin. This is outstanding for an alt coin ( beside ETH ). Just a comparison - the next big alt coin ( XRP ) had a market cap of \~6.9% of Bitcoin. That's nearly half of the size of BNB and after the last weeks looking at right now XRP market cap is way below half of BNB size. This is just a small summary but traders saw the potential of a short term dump in BNB and have been shorting it the last weeks / months after the FTX drama. When people were looking at Binance and the News, panic &amp; FUD started to spread they continued to see more blood for BNB. It's all about traders money and the value of the token - not really the chain itself.

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusion

If you read through this congratulations you managed to catch up on the most important topics but it's unfortunately only the surface. Every topic goes much deeper and I highly recommend digging deeper into the liability part if you are interested.

That being said - Binance will most likely be fine. BNB has found support around $250 and is holding. Worst case scenario it might visit $200, huge whales that leveraged using BNB as collateral around $200 will get liquidated and it might fall lower towards $190. Will this affect Binance negatively? We will see. But until then it is important to understand that Binance problems is nothing like FTX, BNB right now is fine and is just being traded like any other crypto and won't have an impact on Binance without falling drastically lower. ( same as FTT fell over -25% within a few hours )

Binance and the critic around it is purely based on missing transparency and shady practises from the past - that's it. But there is no known big problem that can cause a collapse for Binance nor for crypto.

**But most importantly - THIS IS GOOD FOR CRYPTO. Critism is healthy and important in this industry.** The recent times have been an eye opener for a lot of people withdrawing their funds and performing self custody. Treat Binance like an exchange that it is but don't hope for it to fall. Without Binance a major player will be gone and crypto will take a massive hit. Rather hope for them to proof everything is fine, show full transparency.

**If Binance turns out to withhold everything, proves their points, shows transparency and continous to work properly this entire topic will most likely benefit them in the long run when people will look back at this and remember they survived it.**

Not everything Binance does it perfect nor good. There are definetly some shady practises going on behind closed doors. But future will tell how this will all play out. For now - they won't collapse. As long as you keep your crypto off the exchange you will be save. This post is about the current sitution which can change at all time.

personalfinance,"Current’s interest drop, should I close the account","I have an HYSA with Current. Previously that have had an interest rate of 4% on 6k. They are now slashing that to 0.25% unless I set up direct deposit with them. Because of the limit on funds that can ear interest, this is obnoxious for me. I would have to transfer funds out of my Current account every pay period (funds over 6k do not accrue interest at all and I do not intend to use them for checking).

I believe there is no account minimum. So do I zero out my account, or do I fully close it after migrating funds to my other hysa?

# [Dow futures jump more than 300 points, boosted by Nike shares](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/20/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures rose on Wednesday after earnings reports from two major bellwethers raised hopes that corporate earnings may be better than feared even with a possible recession on the horizon.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 340 points, or 1%. S&amp;P 500 futures rose 0.8% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.6%.
*****
&gt; Nike shares added 12% after the apparel maker beat Wall Street’s expectations for quarterly earnings and revenue. FedEx gained 4.7% even as it fell short of revenue expectations. The package delivery giant beat consensus earnings per share estimates on per-share.
*****
&gt; With the end of 2022 in close sight, all three major averages are on pace to post their worst yearly performance since 2008 and break a 3-year win streak. As of Tuesday’s close, the Dow was down 9.6%. For the month, it’s toppled about 5%. The S&amp;P is down 19.82% for the year and more than 6% for December, while the Nasdaq’s plummeted 32.58% in 2022 and about 8% this month.
*****
&gt; Wednesday’s moves followed a day of slight gains for stocks. The major indexes snapped a four-day losing streak, putting a little wind back into hopes for an end-of-year rally.
*****
&gt; The modest gains came even after the Bank of Japan moved to widen its cap on the 10-year Japanese government bond yield, leading to a spike in the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield higher that initially rattled traders.
*****
&gt; There are a few more big names left to report earnings before the Christmas holiday, with Micron reporting after the bell.

personalfinance,Is it worth it to liquidate my entire stock portfolio for a 20% down payment,"I am looking for a property to buy in a year hopefully, once interest rates drop slightly! Properties in my area range between $400K-$480K, and I have $40K in stocks (i.e. but down from $70K a year ago), and $100K in savings. My annual income isn't high and I earn $50K after taxes. I am not expecting a big raise/promotion in the next year with the current situation in our economy.

Therefore, I am debating whether it makes sense to liquidate my entire stock portfolio for a 20% down payment, or use my savings instead?Another factor to consider is that with current interest rates, the mortgage payment will be around $2.4K/month (i.e including insurance and taxes), which is slightly below the average rental price for a 2-bedroom unit where I live, so I wonder if it even makes sense to buy with current housing prices?

Update: I am adding info I should have included initially. The cost basis for my stock portfolio is 45K so I am only down 5K, but the portfolio is down 30K relative to last year. 

I am 28 yrs old so it would be nice to own a property but I am not in a big rush to buy now per se and I am willing to wait for 1-2 yrs till rates go down further.",finance,1671636766
CryptoCurrency,Not Just Democrats: FTX Exec Gave Tens of Millions to GOP Causes,"It’s no secret Sam Bankman-Fried shelled out millions to Democratic causes. 

But it turns out a fellow top executive — Ryan Salame, the former co-head of FTX’s derivatives business and FTX **whistleblower** — was backing Republicans and conservative PACs in a big way. 

Meanwhile, some of the donations from SBF himself may not have been properly **disclosed**, according to Bankman-Fried’s own telling.

There is no knowing how much he gave under the table. The now-disgraced FTX founder has admitted he kept significant sums to Republicans under wraps. 

“I donated about the same amount to both parties,” Bankman-Fried **told** **Tiffany Fong**, a YouTube influencer, before his **arrest** in the Bahamas[**.**](https://twitter.com/TiffanyFong_) “All my Republican donations were dark.”

His rationale, Bankman-Fried told Fong, had nothing to do with regulatory scrutiny. It was, instead, all about protecting his now-tarnished — but once pristine — public image. 

“Reporters freak the f— out if you donate to Republicans,” he said during the interview. “They’re all super liberal, and I didn’t want to have that fight.”

## But Republicans cashed in, too

At least one executive did not share his concern. Salame, who then held the title of co-chief executive of FTX Digital Markets, made notable personal contributions to GOP campaigns and causes. 

Salame alone gave nearly $23 million almost exclusively to Republicans and right-leaning PACs, according to **FEC data**.

Salame did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Bankman-Fried, arrested in the Bahamas, **faces federal charges**, including money laundering, wire fraud and campaign finance violations.

According to Federal Election Commission (FEC) data, Bankman-Fried personally gave $40 million to various Political Action Committees (PACs) and individual candidates, almost entirely to Democrats.

But FTX US, the American subsidiary of the crypto exchange, donated $500,947.30 between December 2021 and September 2022, according to FEC **records** — the majority to the crypto-focused **GMI PAC**, which primarily backed the Republican-aligned Crypto Innovation PAC during the 2022 midterms. Bankman-Fried served as the entity’s chief executive at the time of the donations. 

Crypto Innovation PAC, in turn, financed the campaigns of Republicans Michelle Bond — who lost the New York Republican primary for the House of Representatives in 2022 — and Rep. Markwayne Mullin of Oklahoma, who beat out his competition. The group also donated to Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., Sen. Ted Budd, R-N.C., and Sen. John Boozman, R-Ark., all of whom won their respective races. 

All had been **vocal** crypto advocates. At least back then. 

Bond also received at least $400,000 in consulting fees from FTX Digital Markets, according to the candidate’s **financial disclosure report** filed in August. No direct donations from FTX to Bond were reported in **FEC filings**. 

Salame was **romantically involved** with Bond. Salame was also a top donor to the **WINRED PAC**, which raked in over $1 billion and gave more than $300,000 to Bond, according to **filings**. 

Bankman-Fried’s personal disclosed donations went a long way toward advancing the recipients’ respective agendas, particularly the Protect our Futures PAC, a liberal initiative that credits $27 million of its total $28.5 million raised to Bankman-Fried himself. 

Reps. Lucy McBath, D-Ga., and Jasmine Crockett, D-Texas, were two PAC-supported candidates that went on to win their seats in 2022.

stocks,Markets gain on strong Nike earnings and increased consumer confidence data,"Nike $NKE is up around 13% this morning, the company's biggest rally since summer of last year. Nike stock is still down 30% this year but after a positive earnings report, investors are seemingly optimistic.

**What they're saying:** “We're executing in the areas we spoke to 90 days ago as we take decisive action to clear excess inventory,” Nike CEO and president John Donahoe told investors on Tuesday. “We believe the inventory peak is behind us. The actions we’re taking in the marketplace are working.”

While wholesale growth, offloading inventory, and China's reopening are important aspects, the 16% YoY increase in direct-to-consumer sales is the real key to Nike’s growth story as it stays relevant by telling stories through its products and remains a highly desirable brand athletic apparel.

**Consumer Confidence is Up**: Consumer discretionary stocks led gains among the major S&amp;P 500 sector indexes, while financial shares also gained.

Nike peers Lululemon Athletica Inc $LULU, Under Armour Inc $UAA, and Vans sneaker maker rose between 1.3% and 2.8%.

FedEx Corp $FDX, which sparked a market selloff in September after pulling financial forecasts, rose 4%, on the delivery company's plans to slash an additional $1 billion in costs.

I opened a Capital One Money Market account in 2018, due to the appeal of a near 2% interest rate at the time. I was looking at their rates recently, and I noticed that Money Market is now only around .8%, while Performance Savings is at 3.3%.

I understand that interest rates change due to the fed rate - but I thought that Money Market accounts are just a type of savings account and usually higher % than ordinary savings. It seems like Capital One flipped which account was worth more and which is less, without me even knowing. 

Am I misunderstanding something fundamental, or does Capital One have a history of silently changing account target rates and names in an effort to cause people like myself to ""miss the bus"" and accidentally sit on a lower yield account type.

personalfinance,Thoughts/opinions on my upcoming car purchase?,"Hello everybody,

So I’m going to be purchasing a car in the very near future. First off, I’m aware that the timing sucks especially for my particular model but I basically need to get a new car and that’s that. I’m looking to buy a 2023 Toyota Tacoma for around $45,000 post tax. I’ll be using a loan to cover around $35,000 of that and my monthly payments may be between $550-600. I make $65,000k per year but live in Southern California so COL is high. 

I understand that under normal circumstances, that car is way out of my price range. But, here’s the question: my job will pay for my truck for 6 months of the year as well as gas.  In my head that basically means the car payments are cut in half for when I’m paying it. I do plan to work at this company for a while longer so financially being tied to them isn’t the worse. So, is this a stupid decision?

Happy to answer any questions that may help and happy holidays!!

Edit: job edit for those curious (I can’t get too detailed) but I’m a specialized field biologist working with endangered species. 6 months are at a site where rent will be $1,500ish a month while truck monthly payment is reimbursed and gas is covered.

personalfinance,Student loan in DTI for HEL,"I am currently on an income driven repayment plan for my student loans. I was trying to get a home equity loan, but I am running into issues with the underwriting. Since federal loans have been in forbearance for so long I no longer have a statement the underwriter will accept. My servicer gave me a ""Student Loan Obligation Statement"" that shows my payments amount to less 2% of my income. But it states that it is only valid for the year.  The underwriter is requiring something that shows the payments for the next 3 years. The servicer said they can't do that as I have to requalify each year and the requirements can change each year.    

Since I can't provide something described as above the underwriter says they have to use 1% of the principal, which comes out to 15% of my income which wrecks my DTI.

Is there something I can do to help fix this and make the underwriter happy?  I am at ~45% DTI now and they require &lt;43%.",finance,1671651447

# Microtransaction Algorithm Patent

From /u/Ashkal_Khire \- [Full Activision-Blizzard Patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160001181A1/en) regarding proposed match making design and patten that was approved in 2019 and proposed in 2015.

To quote directly from the patent:

**For example, in one implementation, the system may include a microtransaction engine that arranges matches to influence game-related purchases. For instance, the microtransaction engine may match a more expert/marquee player with a junior player to encourage the junior player to make game-related purchases of items possessed/used by the marquee player. A junior player may wish to emulate the marquee player by obtaining weapons or other items used by the marquee player.**

# Why does this matter?

Why would Blizzard want to hide MMR at all if the matching is supposedly all based on the MMR and not SR or any other factors as confirmed in the blog post?

Let's walk through a first couple of scenarios regarding why I believe it is possible this patent is currently implemented in OW2.

There is no hard evidence that matches are unbalanced and we have to just go off Blizzard's word that the MMRs in all games are fairly within a reasonable variation. It just feels from the communities experiences that either you roll the game or get rolled.

* Player 1 decides to buy a skin from the shop, Player 2 does not have any skins
   * This algo states that it would factor cosmetic items in regards to tuning the matching variables.
   * From the direct quote, that would mean a **junior** player (noob with a lower MMR) would be matched in the same game so it would encourage cosmetic sales.

In this scenario it promotes an incredible predatory and manipulating business tactic. Player 1 is getting increased dopamine levels from just stomping junior lobbies keeping that player in a better overall mood and gaming session. This would continue to worsen as Player 1 continues to buy cosmetics from the shop.

On Player 2's side, as said from above would possibly encourage some sort of emulation to purchase similar skins from related heroes of the more marquee and experienced player they are being diffed by. This would be alleviated by purchasing and spending money in the shop as now Player 2 would become the more 'marquee' player and the match making engine would flip the games in Player 2's favor.

I want to pull a direct design diagram from the patent here:

https://preview.redd.it/6j7gpqwh3b7a1.png?width=1986&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c41cb4c96b3219d78cc6ffe226c3a549ca63245

Pay attention to **806** as this would incentivize Blizzard to hide MMR. IF this is implemented in OW2 then the community would see we are actually being matched in some seriously rigged matches with differences being way higher than they are disclosing.

**TLDR:** I believe the match making is influenced by a microtransaction patent Activision has active found here - [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160001181A1/en](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20160001181A1/en)

personalfinance,I am $17k in credit card debt,"tl;dr I am in $16.8k debt and am considering a debt consolidation loan with either a mix of balance transfer cards or just the loan (whichever is realistic and the best option). Just below are my interest rates. I need advice.

So, I am currently $16,807 in credit debt and I’m currently trying to figure out the best move to pay off my debt. I have 5 credit cards with APR’s of:

Chase Sapphire (24.24%)
Capital One Cash Rewards (22.82%)
Amazon Prime Rewards (18.49%)
Discover It (20.74%)
American Express Gold (5.99% until 7/23/23 through Financial Relief Program)

I’m currently in the process of getting a late report by Sallie Mae removed which dropped my score by about ~100 points, this happened earlier in the year (I’m an idiot and it fucked me but it’s taught me a lot of responsibility). I’m currently sitting at around 601 FICO 8 per Experian. The late report dropped every single one of my cards’ limits down to their balances and since then I’ve had a credit usage of ~95%. I currently pay around $488 in minimum monthly payments and am trying to figure out what I can do to begin paying much more (aside from getting a better job) and reducing my debt as fast as possible.

I’ve looked into a DMP by Family Means that is part of the NFCC and it would 100% lower my payments and help me pay everything off significantly faster with an interest rate I could only dream of obtaining through regular means but having to close my accounts and taking a really hard hit to my credit doesn’t seem like the best thing for me at the moment. I’ve been fairly responsible with my cards throughout my life (first card at 18 and I’m 26 now) but in the last year I built up a very bad habit that put me in this mess. I want to keep these cards and lock them up except for that minimal use needed to keep them open until I’m 100% debt free. 

I’ve been looking into debt consolidation loans and balance transfer cards but I’m not sure what my best option is at the moment. I was initially thinking a mix of both but I would take a pretty hefty hit to my credit (which I’m okay with for now since I’d be able to keep my accounts open) and I’m concerned with how that would affect me in terms of getting one after the other (loan then card or card then loan). I’m also thinking it may not be possible to do both and to settle with going with what I can do at the moment. I checked some loan offers on Experian but everything is pretty high at around 24% and my current avg interest rate sits at 21% so I’d ideally like something lower. I’ve considered the fact that if I were to get a loan with a higher rate than say my AMEX or Amazon cards but lower than the rest then I’d only take out enough to pay off the higher interest cards.

I’m also in the process of trying to get into a job with higher earning potential so I can pay off as much as possible. I don’t know if I’ve missed anything but I’d appreciate any advice you guys have to offer.",finance,1671663439

personalfinance,Should I lower my Retirement Contribution?,"Here's my situation. 

Just inherited a house that's paid off and 1 car that's paid off, so now I have 2 cars and a house. Early on in my fed career, on a GS7(45K)/9(55K)/11(66K)/12(80k) ladder meaning I'm starting at the 7 and every year presumably I'll get a promotion to the next step till I top out as a 12 in 3 years. 

Current savings is about 66k in a Wealth Management Account, 26k in my TSP, 10k in Ibonds, 5k in cash, 20k in risky investments, 11k in ROTH IRA(Im maxing it out),17k in checking.. so maybe 100k outside of the  retirement account.  

I have no debt at all, I'm paying for my Masters out of pocket via 0% credit cards which are paid off currently till next semester. 

With the costs of the new home ownership(Electricity and internet is exorbitant)I've been considering reducing my TSP Roth contribution to 5%, as it's been at 15% for the last 3 years. After reviewing my take home for this first paycheck, without health insurance I'm only clearing about 1k a pay check, 2k a month.. would it be stupid for me to cut back the retirment contribution to get more take home(Roughly $200 more, putting me at 1200 each check). 

The feds match 5%, so I'll be getting that.. for reference, I'm 29 with no kids and not married. 

I figure I could use more take home cash and then adjust my % towards my pension as I get higher in the pay grades so my takehome won't be nearly as bad. I'm still maxing out my ROTH IRA so I'll have that still.. but am seriously considering knocking my 15% contribution down to the standard 5 for the next year or 2 till I hit an 11(66k).

We don’t plan on moving anytime soon and figure this is a good opportunity to buy panels to maximize our usage. 

Our roof is 21 years old, so that will also need to be replaced, so panels won’t be installed till that’s done. But the good thing is I’ll get the max usage out of my roof and panels. 

Here are the numbers for our current system:

SOLAR SYSTEM SIZE	10.530 - kW DC PV

30% Federal Tax Credit - $10,889

Will be paying cash. And doing the math for the roof replacement separately since that is something that needs to be done regardless.

personalfinance,Does the size of an auto loan matter when establishing credit history &amp; credit mix for future loans (how much to finance for a new car),"TLDR: Is it worth it to pay a few hundred dollars in extra interest to prove that I can pay off a larger loan or will a (relatively) smaller loan do the same for my overall credit picture in the future?

Hi PF,

I (18-25M) am going to buy a new car. I can pay for it in cash, but am looking to finance part of the car to improve my credit. I have a good score at the moment (740-790) but have limited history - the only history on my credit report is a few credit cards. I have so far been able to get a pretty low (3.5-5%) interest rate while shopping around, so the interest won't be too much money. My main purpose to the loan is to pay some money in interest to gain credit history of paying off a sizable installment loan so that I can get approved for more/larger/lower interest rate loans in the future (mortgages, other car loans, etc). 

My main question is this - is there a difference between financing a smaller amount (~$5-10K) and a larger amount (~$20-25K) when future lenders will be looking to approve me for a loan? Obviously the smaller loan will be cheaper in interest, so I'm wondering if there is benefit to taking out a larger loan, or if a smaller one will have the same benefits for my future credit picture. 

Thanks in advance!

And yeah, this is a burner account - don't know why, but I'm uncomfortable sharing a ton of information about myself.

vet,HELP! parasite/mites in deceased Guiena pigs fur?,"Our pet Guinea pig Onyx, passed away tonight.

Her diet consisted of Hay, pellets, and different types of flowers such as chamomile and roses, etc and occasionally was fed veggies/fruit such as , cabbage (in moderation) romaine lettuce (in moderation) , watermelon, etc. 
Before she passed away we noticed she had a increase in begging for food, she loved eating the flowers , but she had been squeaking every time we walked near her pen or as soon as she’d hear a footstep into the door. We noticed no matter how much we’d feed her she became more skinnier and skinner. 
I discovered her tonight I have no idea how long she had been deceased but we noticed she was perfectly fine yesterday, I didn’t notice if there was anything wrong with her before then, as we have our piggies pen in a dark area in the house. However, when I discovered her pen something was unusual because I noticed she wasn’t squeaking I found her resting in her bed not moving. She had passed away 
I noticed these mite/parasite specimen in her fur. My family argues that it may possibly just be tiny pieces of hay…. But it certainly doesn’t look right. They were in her ear, her mouth and mainly in her face. If there’s anyone out there who could give me some knowledge as to what these parasites or specimen may be it’d be very helpful.

investing,Roth 401K vs. Pre-Tax 401K Rationale,"So I am seriously contemplating switching to a Roth 401K (NOT ROTH IRA) from Traditional Pre-Tax 401K.  
Asking the group what I may be missing in my rationale . 

* 53yo/married - so I can max out at $30K
* $30-$50K in non-retirement post-tax investment contributions.
* 24% Federal Tax Bracket.
* Home paid off$700K in traditional IRA roll over and $300K in company 401K.
* $300K in after tax investments
* Annual expenditures - $125-150K

Here's my rationale -

I want to build out my tax-free retirement bucket as large as possible.  Assuming 12 years to retirement - I'll end with $2mm in pre-tax IRA/401K, $1M in after tax investment and $500K in Roth 401K.  I'm not counting the value of my home.   


For retirement disbursements - My plan is to do a 50-50 split from the traditional retirement funds and after tax investments, while letting the Roth ride. My hope is to be a bit more aggressive on the Roth investments to juice the RoR until I need to access it.  I plan to take some excess funds from the pre-tax and roll over to Roth.  If spouse and I take SS at 68 to 70 - I figure I can live this way for a solid 10-15 years before I really need to tap into the Roth.    


The other reason to build as much Roth assets as much as possible is to avoid the widowers tax for me or the wife later in life and/or limit the tax liabilities to the kids.

I recently started a new position here in Texas. The w4 (I think) form that I filled out for taxes had me select if I had dependents and wanted to claim exempt or not. I didn't because I was told that could result in far too little taxes being withheld, but it did have an option to multiply the number of children I have by 2k and include that. My first check came in and had deductions for social security and I think the medicaid tax also. Didn't see much on the federal taxes though and HR told me that's because I had dependents listed because of that 2k x #of dependents item. I was confused but they explained that listing dependents results in much lower tax withholding. 

I have another child on the way early January so I'll be adding them to the 2k multiplied line. My question is, will this result in me paying such little federal tax that I'll owe something even though I didn't claim to be exempt? Thank you for your help. I've read some articles that didn't fully address having dependents on that 2k multiplied but not being exempt deal. HR wasn't sure,  I think they didn't want to make false statements.",finance,1671681607

I took out a mortgage back in July 2021. The total amount for the property was $76,500, of which I gave the bank a 15% down payment (about $11,800). The other $61,200 I got for my bank at a 5.5% interest rate for 10 years.

A little pretext: the country that I live in doesn't require you to pay the expected cash in interest payments if you make early payments. For instance, if I take out $100,000 at 10% for 10 years and decide to pay it all off in exactly 1 year, then I only end up paying $10,000 (I don't have to pay the bank what it exptected to earn in the next 9 years). I could pay the $100,000 in 1 month and only pay $833 if I wanted to.

solar,Solar Experiences with Sol-Up,"Hi everyone!

***(Final Update - December 21st)***

**Ongoing progress and updates with Sol-Up -**

**July 28th** \- Site Survey completed. It took 45 minutes - 1 hour. The Sol-Up team looked at my attic, roof, and desired placement of the Tesla PW and SPAN panel in the garage.

**July 31st** \- More questions all answered by my energy consultant. The agreement was signed and sent back to Sol-up.

**August 4th** \- I submitted the Loan Application. Waiting for Sol-Up to send the loan agreement from their end to Loaner.

**August 5th** \- I called my energy consultant to follow up on the solar loan status. I was approved. I requested additional panels on the quote and so my new agreement has to be signed again.

**August 9th** \-11:30 AM - Updated quote received reflecting additional panels and military discount. I also decided differently on my solar loan. I took the higher interest rate instead of the lower rate but with dealer costs.

**4:50 PM** \- I received the new agreement and signed it. Called the main office for the next steps and all my questions about the new agreement were answered.

**August 10th** \- Solar loan Agreement signed. The sol-Up agreement was signed by sol-up.

**August 11th** \- HOA ARC form required by the project coordinator. I had to get neighbor signatures (required by HOA). I sent the required paperwork a couple of hours later.

**August 15th** \- I called the project coordinator to follow up as I have not yet seen any submitted HOA paperwork to my HOA. No answer. I left an email and voicemail.

**August 16th** \- I called my energy consultant. He will check with my project coordinator regarding my follow up and he also mentioned they submitted the required permits.

**August 19th** \- Received a call from my new project coordinator. My previous project Coordinator no longer works there. Had to resend the HOA paperwork to them again.

**August 22nd** \- Sol-up followed up with HOA, but still no response from HOA.

**August 31st** \- Sol-Up followed with HOA again, but still no response from HOA. I checked my HOA website and it actually got approved 4 days ago, HOA just didn't communicate this to us. I immediately sent the HOA approval letter to my project coordinator. Sol-Up is waiting for warehouse confirmation if they have all the materials needed for installation.

**September 6th** \- Followed up with Sol-Up regarding status.

**September 7th** \- energy consultant responded, the permit is still under review

**September 13th** \- project manager responded (came back from OOO), still waiting for permits. The city permit status is pending review still.

**September 14th** \- NV Energy application sent. Application fee paid by sol up, and now under review.

**September 21st** \- NV Energy incentive application approved. The city permit application needs revision as our project manager seems to have submitted an application that shows we're getting Enphase inverters but the specs show solar edge products and they also needed to provide combiner specs. I emailed the project coordinator to make sure he knows we are getting Enphase, not Solar Edge.

**Oct 13th** \- Received a call from the Project Manager to schedule the solar installation.

**Oct 14th** \- Solar Panels, Inverters, and solar wires ran to the Combiner box from the exterior wall, and the combiner box was installed. Started at 11 AM, and finished at 4:30 PM the same day. Just waiting for them to schedule the following installation - Tesla Powerwalls and Span Panel

**Oct 25th** \- Still waiting for the rest of my solar orders (Span Panel and Powerwall). I received a notice of completion from my solar loan, meaning I have a due date for payment in 3 weeks already. I reached out to my project manager and asked him if the installation, at least, will be completed before then.

As per my agreement with them (very important to read all this!!), I can expect this during the PTO wait but not before all installs are complete.

Of course, I contacted my project manager about this. He responded right away about what's the status of the materials they're waiting on.

**Oct 27th** \- I responded and emphasized to him I don't mind the long wait for installation but I do mind having a payment due date already when not everything is even installed yet. He replied back with him saying, ""let me see what we can do to make this right, I have reached out to management to see the solution.""

**Oct 31st** \- He called me and ask me for a copy of the payment due and he will it send to his management.

**Nov 3rd** \- The project manager called me to set an install schedule. All installs are scheduled for Monday, Nov 7. Expected completion in two days, Nov 9. He also mentioned the check to pay for the first payment has been approved. I thought due to the payment due, they pushed to get the installation done which was fine with me. But they still decided to cover the 1st payment, very surprised and happy about this!

**Nov 7th** \- The install crew (led by their electrician, Elison, who is very knowledgeable and a great person) installed the power walls, span panels, tesla gateway, battery disconnect switch, and needed sub-panels. The next day's plan was to run the wires and conduit in the garage and all the wiring needed and then cut the power off to move all breakers from the original electric to the Span panel. It was expected to snow the whole day too.

**Nov 8th** \- Due to heavy snow, everything was done in the garage (conduit install, wire runs) except the transfer of all breakers to the Span Panel as the original panel was outside.

**Nov 9th** \- Dry but cold day. Elison came in at 8 AM, started prepping everything for the breaker move to Span Panel, and power was cut off at 9 AM. He was done before 12 PM. I went ahead and made sure all the circuits in our house were working. Everything went great w/o issues.

He then started working on registering me an account on Tesla power walls, Enphase, and Span panel! He just needed our wi-fi password to bring the devices online and connected them to my network and started updating them. All the accounts were configured successfully without issues. He then started putting back the circuit breaker labels in the span panel after setting up everything for me.

The best part after all this was simulating the solar and testing them as well as the batteries by putting my house off-grid. I was surprised by how smooth the power cut-over from on-grid to batteries was and how instantaneous I got the tesla notification.

Made me even more excited about getting it all up and running officially!

While Elison was starting to put away all his tools and clean up in the area, the project manager called to ask about my availability for the city inspection this Friday, Nov 11. I was very surprised at how fast that can be scheduled. I actually expected the city inspection to take longer to be done than the utility provider inspection. Of course, we set it up only to get a call back from him again that Friday was not actually possible due to Veteran's day so it got set up to Nov 10, Thursday, instead! The date was set but no time yet though. The project manager assured me that he will let me know in the morning ASAP what time.

**Nov 10th** \- Time was set between 12:30 PM - 2 PM for city inspection. I received this confirmation from the project manager at 8:30 AM. The Sol-Up person came by at 12 PM to do a quality inspection on all the work prior to the inspection. City inspection passed with no issues! I received all copies of the electric diagrams from Sol-Up after. I received an email from the project manager a couple of minutes later about this and was informed to keep an eye out for the utility provider's email to set up an inspection time and date with them as they will need a signature from me. I was told the max wait is up to 20 days from the utility. I hope not!!

Only utility inspection and PTO are left!!

**Nov 14th -** NV Energy Incentive application status was updated. Waiting for NV Energy to review the application and final approval. Approval says can take up to 10 business days.

**Dec 1st -** Unfortunately, approval from the utility took longer than 10 business days due to the Thanksgiving holidays, regardless, it has been approved and is now pending utility inspection and installation of new meters!

**Dec 8th -** The utility inspector came by to inspect the system and install the new meters. Unfortunately, they failed due to the battery setup being wired in reverse from disconnect to the meter socket. Utility inspection has to be rescheduled again after the issue is fixed by Sol-Up.

Sol-Up did fix it 30 minutes after the issue was found and I was told they will take care of it by taking a picture and sending it to the utility for inspection to be rescheduled ASAP.

**Dec 13th** \- I called NV energy to check on the schedule of another inspection only to find out they weren't updated about the issue found during the 1st inspection and that it was already fixed on the same day. I was very disappointed because my project manager assured me they will be updated but it wasn't the case. Regardless, I've informed NV energy that the issue was fixed already and have the inspection scheduled right away. I also informed my project manager of this mistake and they will compensate me by paying my Solar loan bill for the 2nd time.

**Dec 14th** \- I received an email from NV energy that the status is pending utility inspection.

**Dec 20th** \- The utility inspector came by, passed the inspection, and installed the new bidirectional meters for my home and battery! Solar is now up and running! All are good except for my Enphase as it's not associated with the system yet but everything else is working!

I hope the experiences with my installer, Sol-Up, I've shared can give insight to anyone looking to get a solar here in Reno or with Sol-Up Solar company! Sol-Up does offer a military discount too. If anyone has any questions, ask away!

# [Stock futures are muted after Wall Street’s rally on Wednesday](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/21/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures were muted in early trading on Thursday, as traders digested a sharp rally from the previous session.
*****
&gt; Stock futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Averages fell 79 points or 0.23%. S&amp;P 500 futures declined 0.25%, and Nasdaq 100 futures were 0.34% lower.
*****
&gt; CarMax shares dropped more than 12% in the premarket after the used car retailer missed profit and revenue expectations. Micron Technology shares slipped 3% in the premarket on disappointing quarterly results. Under Armour shares shifted between gains and losses after the athletics apparel maker selected Marriott executive Stephanie Linnartz as its next CEO.
*****
&gt; The moves followed another positive session for stocks. On Wednesday, the Dow gained 526.74 points, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite surged 1.49% and 1.54%, respectively.
*****
&gt; All 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors finished the day with gains, led to the upside by energy. Nike and FedEx shares rose on quarterly results, giving some investors hope that earnings are faring decently despite concerns of a downturn. Strong consumer sentiment data for December also gave markets a lift.
*****
&gt; While better earnings results likely factored into the upbeat market sentiment Wednesday, oversold conditions may have contributed to the rally, according to Liz Ann Sonders, Charles Schwab’s chief investment strategist.
*****
&gt; “I think there were a couple of earnings reports that came out that were marginally better than expected,” she said. “But I also think that the market has been in another corrective phase, and, on some technical measures, got a bit oversold. Buyers stepped in. The wiggles on a day-to-day basis are hard to put a direct finger on.”
*****
&gt; Even with Wednesday’s gains, stocks are on pace to finish the month with losses. The Dow is down 3.51%, while the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq have tumbled 4.94% and 6.62%, respectively. All three major averages are slated to break a 3-year win streak and post their worst yearly performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; On Thursday, investors awaited jobless claims data.

personalfinance,Which to prioritise?,"I currently have a fixed term mortgage at 1.87% and student loans at 3.25%.

The fixed term ends in Oct 2023 and I can see rates might be as high as 6%.

I know I won't be able to pay either off in full in that time, but I can put a bit extra towards one of them every month.

What I'm struggling with, is what my priority should be, right now, before the mortgage changes. I would ordinarily go for paying off the top interest rate but I am really concerned about my mortgage increase, especially as I don't know what things will be like then. I'm pretty sure it'll be more than 3.25%.

I want to keep the mortgage repayments the same or lower if I can, but I'm not sure what will work best, particularly as I can't change lender and I don't think the property will be revalued.

CryptoCurrency,Central banks have colluded globally to bankrupt the economy and crypto for now,"If you’re reading this you are still incredibly early. Crypto has stolen power from the central banks and now they are fighting back with a vengeance. Unfortunately they used Covid to enhance their mismanagement of the economy and over spending - who is paying the price? We are, our parents, friends, and future generations..

The central banks have made it a mission to forcefully collude in raising interest rates at the fastest rate in history. Inflation is still at records high. 

In the US alone : The Federal Reserve raised the fed funds rate by 50bps to 4.25%-4.5% during its last monetary policy meeting of 2022, pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2007, and in line with market expectations. It was a seventh consecutive rate hike, following four straight three-quarter point increases. They don’t plan to stop there

In this scenario the G7 are all trying to reach 2% inflation. But we have to ask : at what cost? At this pace they are tethering on a tight rope hoping not to break the whole financial system

Now I understand that hyperinflation would be devastating - however in the US alone they had printed 40% of the money supply during Covid. These actions hurt everyone. We’ve all had reservations on how the pandemic was handled including politically.

This has forced more people into the central banks hand - less money to service debt and cost of living. This directly leads to economic constraint on everyone. 

Risk on assets such as crypto has been sold off (like any bear market) however at a rapid pace. Similarly to deal with the cost of living, people are selling investments and cutting costs drastically just to survive. 

Who benefits ? The politicians , bankers, top 1% of capitalists. Not only did they have insider information to act on, they were closest to the money printers. They have benefited on both sides - the Covid crash and boom/ and now bust. They will now start to sweep up assets for pennie’s on the dollars - all again at the tax payers expense 

History repeats and rhymes. The average joe can’t escape the matrix - assets being sold, working more for less, inflation eroding purchasing power. Most have to struggle once again.

How to escape? Do whatever you can to firstly buy bitcoin - vote with your money. For the first time in history - we the people have a generational asset that will be our future lifeline to combat the central bank atrocities

CryptoCurrency,"Year In Review 2022; Market Share, FTX Charges, Luna and more stats below 👇","YEAR IN REVIEW

The key numbers behind crypto’s historic, tumultuous year

One calendar year in the cryptosphere always manages to somehow feel closer to a decade thanks to the velocity of innovation and the volume of headline-making stories. 2022 gave us plenty of news to keep up with — some good, some, well, not so good. From Ethereum’s historic eco-friendly upgrade to FTX’s infamous collapse, here’s a review of the numbers that account for the highs and lows of crypto’s turbulent, decade-long year.

$2 trillion

Approximate value that the crypto market has shed since peaking near $3 trillion in November 2021. The total value of the crypto market as of December 20 is roughly $850 billion, near lows for the year, and pressured by ongoing inflation and recessions fears, as well as liquidity crises and firm insolvencies in the crypto space.

$18.3 billion

Amount of venture capital raised by crypto startups during the first three quarters of 2022. While that figure is lower than the $23 billion raised by crypto startups in the same span last year, steady VC investment in web3 has defied bear market headwinds. 

$135 million

Amount of crypto donations raised for Ukraine in the first three months after Russia invaded in February. BTC, ETH, and stablecoins including USDT, USDC, and DAI accounted for most of the fundraising, and because crypto assets enable near-instant, cross-border donations, Ukraine was able to quickly use funds for supplies like medical kits, bulletproof vests, surveillance drones, and food. 

2.4 million 

The approximate number of new users who made a trade using a decentralized exchange via Polygon in 2022. Polygon’s new-user growth rate this year accelerated faster than both Ethereum and Solana in the same time period.

208,000

Number of USD Coin (a stablecoin redeemable for $1) addresses with balances over $1,000 as of this month — an all-time high. This development was likely bolstered by several Coinbase initiatives, including waiving fees for converting USDT into USDC, and when buying or selling USDC with any global fiat currency supported by the exchange.

114

Number of nations that are exploring their own “central bank digital currencies.” CBDCs are a completely digital version of government-issued money. Unlike Bitcoin, CBDCs are centralized legal tender, created and controlled by a government or central bank. Like Bitcoin, they can be used for fast and inexpensive global payments.

99.95%

The energy-efficiency improvement of Ethereum after the network completed its long-awaited Merge in September. The upgrade changed how the second-largest blockchain verifies transactions, replacing the energy-intensive Proof of Work method for the more eco-friendly Proof of Stake.

96%

The price decline of Terra’s LUNA token in a 24-hour period in May, shortly after the crypto’s related stablecoin, TerraUSD, a so-called algorithmic stablecoin, lost its peg to the dollar and prompted both of Terra’s undercollateralized tokens to collapse. The ensuing $30 billion wipeout sent shockwaves through the crypto industry that prompted liquidity crises for firms including Celsius, Three Arrows Capital, and more.

14

Age, as of October 31, of Satoshi Nakamoto's Bitcoin whitepaper, which outlines the core mechanics of the cryptocurrency. Next month, on January 3, Bitcoin will celebrate the 14th anniversary of the first transaction ever recorded on the network. The message inscribed in the “Genesis Block'' referenced a newspaper headline about the Great Recession, a key factor in Bitcoin’s creation: “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks.”

9.1%

This year’s peak inflation reading, from June’s Consumer Price Index, which indicated the U.S. was seeing the worst year-over-year inflation increase in 41 years. Red-hot inflation, and the Federal Reserve’s attempt to combat it by raising interest rates, have pressured most markets in 2022, especially riskier growth assets like tech stocks and crypto.

8

Number of charges that Federal prosecutors in Manhattan have brought against Sam Bankman-Fried, the now-infamous former CEO of FTX. A day after SBF was arrested in the Bahamas, U.S. prosecutors unsealed a 13-page indictment, which included counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, and multiple conspiracy counts including money laundering and campaign finance violations. FTX, once valued at $32 billion, is currently in the bankruptcy process. Current CEO John Ray III, who oversaw Enron’s bankruptcy, said of FTX in a filing: “Never in my career have I seen such a complete failure of corporate controls and absence of trustworthy financial information.”

Vietnam’s ranking on Chainalysis’s 2022 Global Crypto Adoption index, the second straight year that it held the top spot. The report, which ranks 146 countries is based on five weighted metrics, such as centralized exchange trade volume and peer-to-peer trade volume.

stocks,Recognizing Regime Change (Morgan Stanley GIC Weekly),"Morgan Stanley GIC Weekly Published December 19, 2022: [https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf](https://www.morganstanley.com/pub/content/dam/mscampaign/wealth-management/wmir-assets/gic-weekly.pdf)

I've been enjoying reading these each week and hope you do too! Not much commentary from me this week but I've pulled out a few interesting quotes below, starting with the intro: 

""We believe 2023 will be difficult for investors because of the uncertainty about the pace and nature of economic slowing, and the Federal Reserve’s response to it. Markets have mostly dismissed policymakers’ hawkish messages and embraced the dovish ones. Some expect policy rate cuts to bring back the 2009-2020 investing regime in which passive index funds, whose returns are largely driven by US secular growth stocks, are winners as disinflation returns and low US Treasury yields support rich valuations. In contrast, we see evidence of a new regime in which growth is stronger, inflation normalizes closer to 3% and interest rates remain higher for longer. In this environment, fundamentals take on added importance, value leads growth, cyclicals beat defensives and non-US stocks outperform the US. Furthermore, long-duration bonds once again hedge stock risk and stocks move as much on earnings as they do on interest rates. Consider repositioning for regime change. Besides fixed income, this means value stocks, global dividend payers, early cyclicals, enterprise technology and the emerging markets.""

&amp;#x200B;

""Even now, the futures market forecasts a terminal fed funds rate of 4.8% versus Fed guidance of 5.2%. The futures market also anticipates as much as 50 basis points of rate cuts next year despite the Fed’s promise to hold rates 'higher for longer.' ""

&amp;#x200B;

""Evidence of regime change comes from the market itself which since September has seen some interesting and powerful shifts. The first is the broadening of the value-overgrowth trade. In large-cap stocks, the performance premium is roughly 17 percentage points. Next, global stocks with high dividend yields are besting the S&amp;P 500. European equities are handily outperforming the US on a currency-hedged basis despite the threats of higher rates, higher inflation and precarious energy dependency. Perhaps most telling is that since mid-August, emerging markets equities have outperformed the Nasdaq Composite by eight percentage points. Stay tuned.""",finance,1671733789

Wall Street is falling Thursday, giving back its gains from the last two days, after better-than-expected data on the economy fueled worries about higher interest rates.

Usually good news on the economy would be good for markets, particularly when worries about a potential recession are high. But the reports showing employers laid off fewer workers than expected last week and that the economy grew more during the third quarter than expected, suggested the Federal Reserve may indeed need to crank rates higher and hold them there for longer to kill off inflation, as it’s suggested.

Some background to help inform advice: 
I've mostly been living in my car for the last 14 months after a traumatic experience earlier that same year left me with PTSD resulting in a sharp decline in my ability to work and subsequent firing. 

I won't go into detail about my symptoms, but on a less than great day in pretty much the scary guy on the corner obliviously ranting to himself in public, and on a bad day I black out and lose all memory of what transpired. It still takes a lot of effort day-to-day day to remain lucid even on a decent day. 

I lived on credit for a while just trying to keep me fed day to day. My mental health has now improved enough that I see my decision making abilities vanished for awhile and I was in pure survival mode. So I went from a perfect credit score and a great job to being delinquent on nearly 20k and using dog sitting jobs to have a place indoors to sleep. 

My car is not in great shape, since I've completely neglected the maintenence, again just didn't have the mental capacity to make it the priority it should be. 

I've tried twice to get disability (Texas) for my PTSD. I am diagnosed, but each time I've applied they've ""lost"" my application and told me to reapply, even after sending me confirmation emails that my application was received and I even had appointment dates confirmed... I talked to a friend of a friend here in Texas who said it took him 2 years of legal battles to get disability for his PTSD and he seems to think that's the status quo for Texas.

So my first thought for the money was to try to get a tiny cheap apartment so that I have some stability and could improve my mental health because just trying to figure out where I'm going to sleep every day takes up a ton of my mental energy. But that would only give me several months at best, if I could even qualify for a lease. 

My next thought was to hire a disability lawyer with the money, but then I'm worried if it really takes so long to get approved I might run out of money before I'm able to.

8/3/22 - Order Placed, requested a 12.5Kw system with a battery.

8/4/22 - Provided my initial site design. It was for a 21Kw system without a battery costing substantially more.

8/8/22 - Had meeting with project manager, explained why I do not want a system that large and why I wanted a battery. Things move prettyquicklyk getting the new design and financing approved.

8/16/22 - Per Project Solar permitting has started.

10/7/22 - Permitting is ongoing. I am asked by Project Solar to go to FedEx, print off some documents and deliver them myself to city hall. I would be reimbursed for the cost of the documents (never was). Next day I drop them at City Hall.

11/25/22 - Today is my install date, no one shows up. 3callss and 3 emails to Project Solar looking for my installer, no response.

11/29/22 - Project Solar finally gets back to me and apologizes for the mix up. They will reschedule the install.

12/1/22 - Install date number 2. Installer arrives, asks me where the panels are going. Installer states he has no design documents from Project Solar and will just use his best judgement on the install. Most of the panels in, but had bent a few rails, so now some panels are hanging by a few corners. Cannot install the battery, said they don't have all the parts.

12/14/22 - Project Solar FINALLY respondhis about the missing parts, they had ordered the wrong meter and the correct one is on back order, no ETA.

12/22/22 - I've sent three emails since asking for any ETA, how this was missed in the design, why my meter is now different. Finally, I received a response of ""we are working on it"". That was it.

I'm at my wits end. I have no idea if my system will be finished, if it is even right, if it will work properly. This was a major investment and I've really screwed up picking Project Solar.

personalfinance,Vanguard 401k options,"I am a 31 yo that spent the first 10 or so years working for the government investing in the government  C and S funds with around $100,000 left in that account when I moved to my new job about a year and a half ago.

personalfinance,New account only way to get higher interest rates?,"I saw that Capital One had some relatively high interest rates on savings accounts, so I thought, ""great, I have a few accounts with them, how convenient!"" Well, the little voice in my head had me double check what rate I was getting and instead of the 3.30%, I'm stuck at 0.30%. I tried calling to ask about this, but the customer service agents kept saying I would need to create a new account to get the new rates (can only do online) and then would need to close the old accounts (of course that can only be done over the phone). It doesn't appear that there are any fees or minimums with the new account, but it just seems odd like the bank is trying to boost numbers of accounts a la Wells Fargo and just using interest rates to incentivize. Are there any downsides to opening more accounts and closing the old ones (other than needing to reconnect transfers w external bank accounts)?

My parents have asked for my input on how they should proceed and I don't really have a good understanding of financial planning to help them as my main focus is equities. I've asked for a breakdown of their expected costs and made them more conservative to help make a decision. 

House 1: This house is a primary residence. Sell House 1 and move into house 2 permanently. We would essentially sell for 0 LTCG as we've been in this house for a while. Cash would be immediately used to clear off all debt (interest rate is 6-8%) and all cash would be put into the US1Y  to support their retirement.

House 2: This house was recently created and is a 2 family house. It would be sold at 1.7 and all cash would be used to immediately clear off debt. **It has been on the market for over 12 months and we have dropped it from 2m -&gt; 1.8 and still no offers.** We would have to pay LTCG and are unable to deduct 500k for primary residence and the remaining cash would be used for US1Y to supplement retirement.

House 2 after living there for 2 years: In this scenario, we assume no housing crash nor appreciation and are able to capitalize on 500k tax reduction by making it our primary residence and selling House 1. Then, my parents would find an apartment to live in.

Modifications: rather than only use the RFR, we put the money into a high dividend etf such as $JEPI. To be conservative, I will assume the stock market will crash another 20% and our yield will only be 8%. We are not looking for capital appreciation, only retirement income. 

The most obvious question is why not rent out the 2 family while living in the primary residence? My father is stubborn and doesn't want to.

What other important information should I look for to better making a decision? What is the better move here? Any advice is appreciated!",finance,1671747753

personalfinance,Take out a loan for 20k at 25% interest rate?,"Recently I was approved for a loan of 20k at the rate of 25%. I know that is high but my finances are currently a mess. I have been living off my cards and also using them to support family who have now left me on my own after finding out im maxed out and have nothing left to give (Blessing in disguise I guess). Here is my monthly breakdown:

|5|1939.11 / 18.74%|50|
|Current Loan:|5720.34 / 13%|270|

I make about 1200 bi-weekly. Would it be better to take this loan, wipe out my CC debt and cut up all my cards? Or do I just tough it out, use the snowball method and just start from the lowest amount and work my way out of this hole?

additional info: I have tried asking other banks and credit unions regarding a loan and they have turned me down. According to the loan site, my monthly payment would be 570.

Can you also ELI5 your answer. Im just at my limits right now and could really use some insight. Thank you

economy,"Dr. Stephanie Mose: ""A single mother with two children earning the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour needs to work 235 hours per week, the equivalent of almost six full-time minimum-wage jobs, to make a living wage.""","While the minimum wage sets an earnings threshold under which our  society is unwilling to let families slip, it fails to approximate the  basic expenses of families in 2021.  Consequently, many working adults  must seek public assistance and/or hold multiple jobs to afford to feed,  clothe, house, and provide medical care for themselves and their  families.  


Establishing a living wage and an approximate income needed to meet a  family’s basic needs would enable the working poor to achieve financial  independence while maintaining housing and food security.  When coupled  with lowered expenses for childcare and housing, the living wage might  also free up resources for savings, investment, and the purchase of  capital assets (e.g., provisions for retirement or home purchases) that  build wealth and ensure long-term financial stability and security.

An analysis of the living wage (as calculated in December 2021 and  reflecting a compensation being offered to an individual in 2022),  compiling geographically specific expenditure data for food, childcare,  health care, housing, transportation, and other necessities, finds that:  The living wage in the United States is $24.16 per hour, or $100,498.60  per year in 2021, before taxes for a family of four (two working  adults, two children), compared to $21.54, or $89,605.51 in 2020. 

The minimum wage does not provide a living wage for most American  families.  A typical family of four (two working adults, two children)  needs to work more than two full-time minimum-wage jobs (a 98-hour work  week per working adult) to earn a living wage. Single-parent families  need to work almost twice as hard as families with two working adults to  make a living wage. A single mother with two children earning the  federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour needs to work 235 hours per week,  the equivalent of almost six full-time minimum-wage jobs, to make a  living wage.  
 Across all family sizes, the living wage exceeds the poverty threshold,  often used to identify needs.  State minimum wages provide for only a  portion of the living wage. For two adult, two children families, the  minimum wage covers 59.8% of the living wage at best in Washington and  29.9% at worst in Wisconsin. This means that families earning between  the poverty threshold ($26,500 for two working adults, two children on  average in 2021) and the living wage ($100,989 on average for two  working adults, two children per year before taxes) may fall short of  the income and assistance they require to meet their basic needs.

personalfinance,Moving from the suburbs to a property with land…advice?,"I’m aware the obvious answer of which is the better investment, but, wondering if this is the “no, why would you do that?” situation all of our friends and family think it is. 

My husband and I own a home with a low mortgage payment (1k) with about 250k in equity. We live at an intersection that has tons of walkable shops and bars being built in a town that is expanding like crazy. Everyone tells us to keep the house since the value will only continue to go up, or rent it. We hate living here. We’d love to have a home with a bit more space (currently 1300sq ft and would love 1800) and most importantly, land (at least an acre). 

Some quick notes:
-We don’t know much about finances and are trying to learn, but not sure where to start.
-Our dream is to own land, and we’re hitting the “we don’t think we can have kids so let’s got for it” point but I don’t want to make a bad decision out of haste. 
-we bought the home for 115k in 2011, and it’s now worth around 450k, we refinanced once a few years ago for 90k to pay for major home repairs / renovations.


We don’t have a lot of savings currently (medical bills) but would like to try to use this move to put ourselves in a better situation financially. We live comfortably but I’ve had some medical issues arise this year and want to plan better for the future… we learned the hard way this year. 

I personally don’t think that we can afford to rent our house and buy another. We would need to save for a down payment, personal emergency fund, a rental emergency fund, and a company to manage. We could rent for between 2-3k a month from my basic understanding, but I’m not sure that’s worth the initial investment.

We’ve also been remodeling the house (kitchen counters, appliances, flooring, trim, backyard remodel, foundation repair, and replaced all of the fans/lighting and blinds). We refinanced a few years ago to do these upgrades (the foundation alone was 35k) and think it may not be wise to refinance again? Especially with how high interest rates are? We still have ~250k in equity after this.

So my question is, would it be a bad investment to sell our home and buy a property out of town with the way the market currently is?
Thoughts on mobile homes? We could buy a mobile home on land for around $350k, but my husband thinks it’s a bad investment. 
I know our home value will continue to go up, but if we move to a further out location, are we at risk of losing value? We’re nervous we will be making a huge mistake.

But mostly importantly! We don’t know where to go with all of these questions. Real estate agent? Financial planner?",finance,1671777163

vet,6 month old JRT vomited multiple times tonight and is now lethargic,"My fiancé fed our puppy mahi mahi fish from a restaurant earlier today as we’d read that it isn’t bad for them. He still only fed him a very small amount. About 2 hours after, he suddenly vomited, then about an hour later vomited 2 more times. He was able to eat his puppy food and drink water after. No diarrhea either so I assumed he was okay.
We laid down for bed and he seems lethargic/extra sleepy now… I have been waking him every so often to check on him but he is really out.
Any recommendations? Should I take him to emergency?

CryptoCurrency,Maybe I should have clarified: crypto is not the only chance average people have.,"So yesterday I made a post saying that crypto is one of the few chances normal people have of making *significant* money in the investment realm and I stand by this. 

I am not advocating for people to go all in crypto or use it as a Hail Mary to get out of poverty or debt. 

The most important thing someone can do to better their financial situation is to invest time and effort into one’s self to maximize their earning potential. Take classes, network, change jobs every couple of years to keep wages increasing instead of stagnating. The second most important things to eliminate are unnecessary expenses and debts that are killing your cash flow. After this it’s probably a good idea to have an emergency fund and sure up your current standard of living. After this it’s best to diversify your excess cash into various investment opportunities, yeah it’s less sexy but it protects you from having your eggs in 1 or 2 baskets and getting wiped out. 

I am not advocating for people to throw random $$ into shitcoins working a retail job and then get upset when they don’t “make it” out of a few hundred $$ worth of SafeDogeElon. I’m saying by buying BTC/ETH almost as a crazy high risk index fund isn’t a bad play over the coming years and has a chance to be your biggest winner. 

#TL:DR- best way to change your economic standing is to invest in yourself/career. Crypto is high risk/high reward compared to almost every other speculative investment play and BTC/ETH have out performed many others, but it’s not guaranteed for the future.",cryptocurrency,1671799611

investing,Why does everyone say save in a 401k?,"I'm wondering why it seems everyone always is pro-investing in a 401k, even in bad market times? Many financial advisors only just encourage you to contribute more money to retirement savings, and it seems all of these advisors rarely ever will actually follow the market and/or expectations. I mean shouldn't people who's only job is to protect your assets actually be trying to do just that? Everyone still says 401ks are the way to go and ROTH IRAs - even when pretty much every Fortune 500 CEO right now is calling for a global recession next year. Many people are actually even calling for a huge stock market crash in January as the jobs reports start to reflect reality. And then there is the fact historically every time the fed pivots on interest rate hikes, the market crashes.

stocks,US stocks won't fall sharply in 2023 — the weak dollar will juice earnings,"[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/savingandinvesting/us-stocks-won-t-fall-sharply-in-2023-like-wall-street-giants-expect-because-the-weak-dollar-will-juice-earnings-a-top-strategist-says/ar-AA15zoGs?cvid=0790f5196b904b7a87ef29329d90ca16)

Wall Street's top banks are overly bearish on stocks, because the declining dollar could prop up company earnings in 2023, according to one market strategist.

""The dollar weakness that we're starting to see is something that a lot of people aren't talking about,"" Carson Group's Ryan Detrick told Yahoo Finance on Wednesday.

""In the next year, dollar weakness can really be a tailwind for global earnings.""

The US dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six other currencies, has slipped nearly 7% over the past three months. 

Markets expect the Fed to ease off on its rate-hiking campaign in 2023. When interest rates fall, a currency tends to depreciate, because investors seek higher yields elsewhere.

A weaker dollar boosts companies' revenues when they export goods and services. That could help to prop up stock market earnings next year, according to Detrick.

""40% of revenues come from overseas for the S&amp;P 500, so a weaker dollar like we're anticipating could be a little bit of a tailwind for earnings actually coming in better than people think,"" he said.

Wall Street's top banks aren't so bullish on stock market earnings.

Bank of America and Morgan Stanley both said at the start of December that they're expecting companies to downgrade their targets as the threat of a recession leads to a fall in spending.

They forecast that the benchmark S&amp;P 500 will fall as low as 3,000 points in the first quarter, which would represent a 23% plunge from its level as of Tuesday's close.

But Detrick is more optimistic. He said that a combination of the weak dollar, inflation starting to fall towards the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and the US economy managing to avoid a recession could fuel a stock market surge.

""I think I'm open to the idea that we could have a surprise rally in the first half of next year with inflation coming back and the economy not going into recession,"" he told Yahoo Finance. 

""Everybody is bearish,"" Detrick added. ""Markets have a funny way of surprising the masses.""",finance,1671806093

economy,Why everyone thinks a recession is coming in 2023,"Recessions often take everyone by surprise. There’s a very good chance the next one will not.

Economists have been forecasting a recession for months now, and most see it starting early next year. Whether it’s deep or shallow, long or short, is up for debate, but the idea that the economy is going into a period of contraction is pretty much the consensus view among economists. 

“Historically, when you have high inflation, and the Fed is jacking up interest rates to quell inflation, that results in a downturn or recession,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “That invariably happens - the classic overheating scenario that leads to a recession. We’ve seen this story before. When inflation picks up and the Fed responds by pushing up interest rates, the economy ultimately caves under the weight of higher interest rates.”

Zandi is in the minority of economists who believe the Federal Reserve can avoid a recession by raising rates just long enough to avoid squashing growth. But he said expectations are high that the economy will swoon.

“Usually recessions sneak up on us. CEOs never talk about recessions,” said Zandi. “Now it seems CEOs are falling over themselves to say we’re falling into a recession...Every person on TV says recession. Every economist says recession. I’ve never seen anything like it.”

stocks,I'm starting to believe the Fed is looking for DEFLATION,"So here me out: PCE data and CPI data both show a forward inflation rate of 1.2% annualized, and even with a margin of error between 0.1-0.2, it would be 1.2-2.4% forward annualized inflation. In that case, when the YoY inflation metric starts from July 2022-July 2023, with June 2022 being peak inflation, it seems that the real federal funds rate will be positive significantly. That is going to cause heavy deflationary action unless the feds reverse course. With the lagging effects of interest rates, we still haven't seen the full effects go through the economy, so I would not be surprised to see 0% month over month PCE and CPI data.

However, the Fed is adamant on getting FFR to 5%+ with no sign of looking at softening data. It's target focused on wage Inflation which might make the rest of the economy suffer deflation to reach target. 

Makes me wonder if the Fed is trying to intentionally cause deflation so that inflation is much harder to roar back once the Fed ""eases"" the rates. Gonna be a sour economy for the next year or two.",finance,1671810970
cybersecurity,"The talent shortage is not going away, it's getting worse. What are your ideas to fix it?","**Have you read the latest ISACA State of Cybersecurity survey? Here are the stats that really jumped out at me:**  


* 73% of respondents whose cybersecurity teams are significantly understaffed say their organizations experienced difficulties retaining qualified professionals (an 8% increase from last year).  

* 63% of enterprises report having unfilled cybersecurity positions (an 8% increase from last year).  

* 60% of enterprises report experiencing difficulties in retaining qualified cybersecurity professionals (a 7% increase from 2020).  

* 55% do not believe applicants are well qualified.  

* 53% report the average time to fill an open position: 3-6 months.  

* Only 45% are training non-security staff who are interested in moving into security roles.  

* 47% of respondents have left a job due to limited promotion / development opportunities.  

* Only 44% manage security staff with less than 3 years of work experience.

  
**Conclusions drawn from the ISACA survey:**  


* For many years, the demand for cybersecurity talent has steadily risen.  

* Staffing levels, retention, and cyberattacks are somewhat interrelated.  

* The workforce shortage is not going away, it's getting worse.  

* Lengthy time to fill vacancies increases workplace stress and can influence employees to look elsewhere for opportunities.   

* The industry is struggling to hire and train entry-level professionals, which is straining an aging workforce.  


**Solutions (or at least some ideas from me):**  


* Software Developers have junior positions, why can't we? When I started out, I was a tech and worked my way up to an analyst. But that seems to be the exception, not the norm. We need to create a viable pathway to level up our junior level talent, they are the future of the industry. Failure to do so, and these folks will leave to do something else. We really need to start filling our talent pipeline, and the sooner the better. Obviously a junior can't do everything a mid-level or senior could, but certainly there are easier and more monotonous tasks a junior can take off the team's plate, freeing up their more senior professionals to focus more time and attention on the critical functions of the business.  

* Lots of great talent from oversees, but companies are hesitant to hire talent outside of their geographic location. I can understand if you need a worker to physically be at an in-house SOC solution you've built locally, but most of these jobs can be done remotely. I've worked with a lot of folks from all around the world, I found them all to be very hard working and incredibly bright.   

* Job requirements and descriptions need to be re-evaluated. We have all had a good laugh at some of these ridiculous requirements (i.e. 10 years experience in a tool that has only existed for 3 years), but non-technical folks, especially recruiters, rely too heavily on these bad job descriptions. Some skills and abilities are necessary to fulfill a job's functions, others can be learned/taught.

economy,The Fed funds rate is irrelevant.,"I’ve noticed that the Fed funds rate has been the most important detail when evaluating the US economy and I want to give my thesis as to why it’s becoming irrelevant. 

To those who don’t know. The Banks don’t actually borrow from the fed at 4.5% or whatever that number is. The Fed actually pays the banks that amount on their surplus cash. So it incentivizes the banks to not lend less than that 4.5%.

Here’s the kicker, the Fed isn’t in control of money printing any longer because the surplus is much bigger and more widespread than they could ever know due to their frivolous printing. 

It’s important for banks that deal directly to consumers…. But most banks do not do that anymore. 

For example, Synchrony and GreenSky and many other lenders have a unique method that will keep consumer interest rates at zero. 

Most banks are charging the middle man the interest up front. In home improvement which is the one or biggest industries the banks charge dealers upwards of 11% and then advertise 0% financing to consumers. The kicker is that they need to make their payments or they get ridiculous interest rates. 

So we’re having a Fed that is being naive about how much power that big banks and shadow banks have.

As time moves forward the Fed will have to overreach even more and more and encroach on more peoples privacy in order to reach the desired outcome. 

I don’t know what to do with this info, but yeah it could be important moving forward.",finance,1671815076
personalfinance,Bank recommendations for switching from WF,"I currently bank with Wells Fargo (have for years, mostly out of inertia) and am wanting to find a new bank. The primary driver for this is piss poor interest rates on the savings account (0.01%, or a face melting 0.02% if I switch to their ""premium"" savings account) where I've seen some people report up to 3% at other banks with the average seeming to be around 2%. For reference, I have about $30k I'm willing to keep in savings and the rest is in stocks, 401k, etc. I haven't been to a branch in years, mostly because all of them are ""temporarily"" closed and have been since covid hit the states and also because I haven't really had any need to go to one in person for a long time so I'm not opposed to an online-only bank like I believe sofi is but I'm skeptical.

The rising global inflation has indeed been a factor to influence crypto prices.

But BTCs inflation is a completely other story. While it has been high at the beginning of its story there has been a steady decline since then, and you guessed it, it was due to the halvings. The halvings are probably the most clever implemention in crypto history, ever. Satoshi Nakamoto really knew what he was doing there.

6. If you sell 1 lot of usd/chf and buy 1.4 lots of usd/jpy you will make about 10% interest annually, using 10x leverage, you can make 100% per year if the interest rates stay constant, also depending on what your broker offers etc.",finance,1671829198
NFT,US election agency approves use of NFTs as campaign fundraising incentive,"The United States Federal Election Commission has issued an advisory opinion stating DataVault Holdings may use nonfungible tokens for fundraising efforts.  


The FEC said it was “permissible” for DataVault holdings to send nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, to political campaign contributors without violating rules on corporate contributions. According to the election agency, DataVault will receive “reasonable compensation” for each NFT issued to contributors, as well as track all tokens issued for its own records.  


Personally, I believe that as time goes on, we will see an increase in the number of these occurrences. Have you noticed how NFTs, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrency are getting closer to us all the time? People are becoming more and more familiar with these concepts, and a lot of different industries are starting to use them for their own enterprises.  


I mean, healthcare, banks, and even the energy sector as I find out through Elan Future not so long ago have implemented blockchain into their industry. I think that's a huge improvement for all of us.  


The FEC issued a similar advisory opinion in 2019 on blockchain tokens, saying certain ones were “materially indistinguishable from traditional forms of campaign souvenirs.” In that case, congressional candidate Omar Reyes’ tokens had “no monetary value” and were used as an incentive to engage in volunteer activities for the campaign.

stocks,What do you believe is already baked into the market?,"It seems like almost every analyst is saying we will face some degree of a recession in the coming year or two. Some believe it will be light, some believe it will be moderate, and some believe it will be severe.

China recently reopened, which is good news. 

The Russia-Ukraine crisis is ongoing, which is terrible for humanity, not to mention the market. 

BOJ and other central banks across the world are raising rates to fight inflation. 

Fed chair, Jerome Powell, says that there is still some pain to come as they will continue raising rates. They’ve slowed rate increases and may pause soon but they will keep them high “as long as it takes” in order to tame inflation. This exact timetable is unknown and relies on future conditions but still sounds pretty harsh. 

Over the past several months, inflation has been noticeably ticking down but is still pretty high YoY. It’s clear the rate hikes have been helping to some degree, but we know there’s a lagging effect. We haven’t seen this affect the unemployment rate just yet and consumer spending is still holding on. But we may get hit hard soon. If that happens, inflation will come down even more, but it will also take down corporate earnings, which will increase unemployment, which will have a very negative affect on the economy. 

The golden question is: exactly how much will earnings come down, and how hard will the recession be…

No one knows just yet. So far, it hasn’t been horrible. 

How much of this information is already baked into the current market (in your opinion) being that the overall market sentiment is pretty negative over the next 6 months? And why do you feel that way?",finance,1671833843

I called the company that holds the annuity and the gave me a brief overview. I have to pull the money out within the next 10 years. I can take out as much or as little as I want between now and then but whatever I take gets taxed as income. Right now it’s earning about 4-5% interest. The representative said at the very least I should pull it from the current annuity and put it into a new one because the interest rate would be better now. I’m not planning taking out any this year but on Jan 1 I wake to take out about 30K to pay off credit card and medical debt. What I don’t know is how to reinvest the remaining 30K. Also my wife has 40K in 401K from a previous job and she needs to move that somewhere. I only bring up the 401K in case it would be better to put 70K (my 30 her 40) into something.

stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning December 26th, 2022","Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks! I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and are ready for the new trading week ahead. :)

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning December 26th, 2022.

# **S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq close higher Friday, but fall for a third straight week - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq Composite rose Friday, but still posted a weekly loss as recession fears continue to batter investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6% to 3,844.82, while the and Nasdaq Composite added 0.2% to close at 10,497.86. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176.44 points higher, or 0.5%, to 33,203.93.
*****
&gt; The major indexes oscillated earlier in the session after the core personal consumption expenditures price index, the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation, came in slightly hotter than economists expected on a year-over-year basis, indicating that inflation is sticking despite the Fed’s efforts to fight it.
*****
&gt; “The economic numbers announced today highlight the difficulty for investors today, where weak numbers bring recession fears and strong numbers bring Fed fear,” said Louis Navellier, founder and chief investment officer of growth investing firm Navellier &amp; Associates.
*****
&gt; “You just can’t win right now on macro numbers,” he added. “That is why it’s now much more of a stock-picking market, but with all the index and ETF traders even stocks that are executing their business plan well can get pushed around meaningfully by associated losers.”
*****
&gt; The S&amp;P 500 ended the week down about 0.2% for the week, posting its third straight weekly decline. The Nasdaq Composite, meanwhile, lost 2% for the week, also for the third down week in a row. The Dow was the outperformer, posting a 0.9% gain.
*****
&gt; Recession fears have resurged recently dashing some investors’ hope for a year-end rally and leading to big losses in December. Investors worry that overtightening from central banks worldwide could force the economy into a downturn.
*****
&gt; For December, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq have lost more than 4% and 8.5%, respectively. Those are the biggest monthly declines for the major averages since September. Stocks are also on pace for their worst annual performance since 2008.

&gt; # What You Need to Know About the Bank of Japan’s (Unexpected) Monetary Policy Change

&gt; The Bank of Japan (BOJ) made a surprise decision on Tuesday to widen the allowed trading band for 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGBs) from ~25 to ~50 basis points. This move signals a shift in the BOJ’s approach to monetary policy and inflation and is likely to be sustained by the incoming governor of the BOJ.

&gt; For context, Japan has implemented a dovish monetary policy stance for years, with the BOJ’s rates remaining at 0% and large-scale quantitative easing being standard practice. The central bank has targeted a range around zero for the benchmark government bond yield since 2016 and has used this as a tool to keep overall market interest rates low. The policy change could alter the flow of capital from Japan, a major exporter of capital.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/JGB-vs-UST.png))**

&gt; The decision to widen the trading band caused the yen to spike and bond yields to rise. This caught investors off guard, who had expected the BOJ to wait to make changes to its yield curve control until Governor Haruhiko Kuroda steps down in April. The 10-year Japanese government bond yield has spiked to 0.47%, close to the BOJ’s newly set implicit cap.

&gt; # The Largest Buyers of U.S. Treasuries, But for How Long?
&gt; Japanese investors have historically sought investment opportunities outside of Japan, and as of October 2022, they were the largest holders of US Treasuries. The BOJ’s decision can significantly alter this flow of capital, causing Japanese investors to reconsider purchasing US Treasuries. The market is currently pricing in higher Japanese yields and a stronger yen. The rise in Japanese government bond (JGB) yield provides an increased incentive for Japanese investors to keep cash at home amid the global economic slowdown. This has the potential to negatively affect foreign risk assets, as well as strengthen the Yen versus the US Dollar.

&gt; # A Preview of Things to Come?
&gt; The Bank of Japan’s (BOJ) low-interest rate policy and its consistent purchase of bonds to maintain its yield cap have been criticized for distorting the yield curve, reducing market liquidity, and contributing to the yen’s depreciation, which has increased the cost of importing raw materials. The main question is whether this is a one-time adjustment or if we are getting a preview of what Japan’s new monetary policy approach will be moving forward.

&gt; This unexpected move by the Bank of Japan has the potential to be a headwind to the US Dollar as the Japanese Yen strengthens. We’ll continue to monitor the implications of the hawkish move by the Bank of Japan and be sure to keep you updated along the way.

&gt; # Russell 1,000 Stocks Down the Most from All-Time Highs

&gt; As we wrap up an awful year for the stock market, below we highlight a list of the current Russell 1,000 stocks that are the farthest below their all-time highs. For the index as a whole, the average stock is down 15.85% YTD on a total return basis, while the average stock's price is about 38% below its all-time high.

&gt; About 30% of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are currently at least 50% below their all-time highs, while about 10% of index members are at least 75% below all-time highs. Below we list the 38 stocks that are all down at least 85% from their all-time highs and it includes Palantir's (PLTR) 85.96% drop to Plug Power's (PLUG) near evaporation of 99.2%. Most of these names have come down from all-time highs that were made at some point in 2021, although some like PLUG, AIG, and Citi (C) made highs a long time ago.

&gt; This list is a who's who of stocks that got caught up in the post-COVID retail investor buying spree. A name like Carvana (CVNA) hit its all-time high of $376.69 relatively recently in August of last year. It's at $4.13/share as of this morning. Upstart (UPST) traded above $400/share last October, and it's at $13 and change now. Roku (ROKU) got up to $490.40 last summer and is at $42 now or more than a full decimal point to the left!

&gt; # The Best and Worst Performing Stocks of 2022 (through 12/22)

&gt; Below are lists of the best and worst performing Russell 1,000 stocks year-to-date on a total return basis. We'll start with the worst first. Five stocks in the index are down more than 90% this year: Carvana (CVNA), Opendoor (OPEN), Novavax (NVAX), Upstart (UPST), and Affirm (AFRM). Another eleven are down more than 80%, which includes names like Coinbase (COIN), Twilio (TWLO), Wayfair (W), Lucid (LCID), and Roku (ROKU).

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/riydownytd.png))**

&gt; Seventy-two percent of stocks in the Russell 1,000 are down YTD, but below are the names that have bucked the trend and gained the most. Just three stocks are up more than 100% YTD: Occidental Petroleum (OXY), Signify Health (SGFY), and Texas Pacific (TPL). Of the 38 names shown, 23 are from the Energy sector, with big names like Exxon Mobil (XOM), Chevron (CVX), and ConocoPhillips (COP) included. Exxon's 78.8% YTD gain is easily its biggest annual move higher since at least 1980. Merck (MRK) is the biggest of the non-Energy stocks that made the list with a YTD gain of 49.8%.

&gt; # Day After Christmas NASDAQ &amp; Russell 2000 Up 73.5% Of Time

&gt; Santa Claus Rally starts today. The Santa Claus Rally was discovered and named by Yale Hirsch in 1972 and published in our 1973 Stock Trader’s Almanacas the last five trading days of the year and the first two trading days of the New Year. This short, sweet rally is usually good for about 1.3% on the S&amp;P 500, but the real significance of the SCR is as an indicator.

&gt; It is our first seasonal indicator of the year ahead. Years when there was no Santa Claus Rally tended to precede bear markets or times when stocks hit significantly lower prices later in the year. As Yale’s famous line states (2023 Almanac page 118): “If Santa Claus Should Fail To Call, Bears May Come to Broad and Wall.”

&gt; NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have logged the greatest frequency and magnitude of gains on the day after Christmas. Since 1988, NASDAQ has advanced 73.5% of the time with an average move of +0.42%. R2K has also advanced 73.5% of the time with an average advance of +0.40%. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have slightly softer records, but bullish, nonetheless.

&gt; Two days after Christmas, the market is less bullish with NASDAQ down more often than up. Three days after Christmas R2K small caps take the lead advancing 64.7% of the time with an average gain of +0.46%.

&gt; Looking further out, from 1950-1985 last 5 trading days of the year S&amp;P 500 up 34 of 36 years, average gain 1.24%. 1986-2021 up 19 of 36, average gain 0.43%.

&gt; # Is it Finally Time for The Santa Claus Rally?

&gt; “If Santa should fail to call, bears may come to Broad and Wall.”
—Yale Hirsh

&gt; One of the little-known facts about the Santa Claus Rally (SCR) is that it isn’t the entire month of December but is actually only seven days. Discovered in 1972 by Yale Hirsch, creator of the Stock Trader’s Almanac (carried on now by his son Jeff Hirsch), the real SCR is the final five trading days of the year and first two trading days of the following year, not just December. In other words, the official SCR is set to begin tomorrow, Friday, December 23, 2022.

&gt; Historically, it turns out these seven days indeed have been quite jolly, as no seven-day combo is more likely to be higher (up 79.2% of the time), and only two combos have a better average return for the S&amp;P 500 than the 1.33% average return during the official Santa Claus Rally period.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-188.png))**

&gt; Here’s a chart we shared recently showing that it is the latter half of December when most of the seasonally strong gains occur.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-255.png))**

&gt; These seven days tend to be in the green, so that is expected. But fun trivia stat, the SCR has been higher the past six years and hasn’t been higher seven years in a row since the ‘70s. The all-time record was an incredible 10-year winning streak in the ‘50s and ‘60s. Here we show all the SCR periods since the tech bubble and how the S&amp;P 500 does after each.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/blog-356.png))**

&gt; The bottom line is that what really matters to investors is when Santa doesn’t come, as Mr. Hirsch noted in the quote at the start of this blog.

&gt; Here we show some recent times investors were given coal during these seven days, and the results after aren’t very good at all. The past five times that the SCR was negative saw January down as well. Then consider when there was no SCR in 2000 and 2008, not the best times for investors, and potentially some major warnings that something wasn’t right. Lastly, the full year was negative in 1994 and 2015 after no Santa. We like to say in the Carson Investment Research team that hope isn’t a strategy, but I’m hoping for some green during the SCR!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-46.png))**

&gt; Finally, the average gains each year for the S&amp;P 500 is 9.3% and is higher 71.8% of the time. But when there is a SCR, those numbers jump to 10.5% and 73.2%, falling to only 5.0% and 66.7% when there is no Santa. Sure, this is only one indicator, and we suggest following many more indicators to base your investment decisions, but this is clearly something we wouldn’t ignore either.

&gt; # Don’t Lose Faith Yet

&gt; Stocks have sold off hard after the Fed took a more hawkish-than-expected tone last week, which now has stocks looking at one of their worst December returns ever. The good news is that there is still time, and one of the most bullish times of the year is right around the corner.

&gt; We will discuss in more detail the Santa Claus rally tomorrow, as it officially starts on Friday. But today, I’ll do a quick blog with a table that is always very popular.

&gt; As you can see, this table breaks down how each day of the year does. In my opinion, we are amid some of the strongest days of the year, from late December to early January. With stocks quite oversold and sentiment extremely negative, we expect a rally quite soon.

&gt; # No Worse Year for Sentiment

&gt; The past few weeks had been uneventful when it comes to the AAII's weekly reading on investor sentiment. As we noted last week, the three-week range that bullish sentiment occupied had reached a record low hovering between 24.3% and 24.7%. In the latest release, sentiment finally moved but not in the most promising direction. Bullish sentiment dropped 4 percentage points down to 20.3% this week to make for the lowest reading since the end of September.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-1.png))**

&gt; With a decline in neutral sentiment as well, all of the increase went to bears with that reading rising to the highest level and back above 50% for the first time since late October.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-2.png))**

&gt; As a result of the large inverse moves of the two sentiment readings, the bull-bear spread shows a dramatic tilt towards an even more pessimistic bias with bears outnumbering bulls by 32 percentage points. That is the widest spread since the week of October 20th and lower than most of the past decade's range.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-3.png))**

&gt; With yet another week of bears outnumbering bulls, the record streak of negative readings in the bull-bear spread has grown to 38 weeks long; a full month longer than the previous record ending in October 2020. Historically, investor sentiment has acted as a contrarian indicator meaning low readings on optimism have typically been followed by stronger returns for the S&amp;P 500. This time around, sentiment and prices have given each other little reason to turn around.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-AAII-5.png))**

&gt; In an earlier post, we noted how there has not even been a single week this year in which bullish sentiment has been above the historical average of 37.6%. Taking another look at just how depressed sentiment has been, the average bullish sentiment reading in 2022 has been less than 25%. The only years that had come close to such a low reading were 1988 (27.29%) and 1990 (27.08%). Playing into that low average has been the fact that there have been a record 30 weeks this year with bullish sentiment coming in below 25%. Meanwhile, bearish sentiment has averaged 46.17% this year, slightly above the previous record of 45.2% in 2008. With bearish sentiment tipping back above 50% once again this week, there have now been 17 weeks with such an elevated reading, tying the record from 2008 with one week to go.

&gt; # Malaise Among Individual Investors

&gt; The misery of 2022 has continued when it comes to investor sentiment. In the latest weekly AAII poll, bullish sentiment declined from 24.3% down to 20.3%. That's the lowest reading since the end of September and less than five points above the YTD low of 15.8% from mid-April.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122222-aaii.png))**

&gt; As shown in the chart above, there hasn't been a single week this year where bullish sentiment has been above its historical average of 37.6%, and the only week where sentiment was even close to its historical average was at the start of the year. With just one week left in the year, barring a historic one-week surge, 2022 will go down as the first year in the history of the AAII survey where there wasn't a single week that bullish sentiment was above average. Talk about malaise.

&gt; # Mega-Caps Down $5 Trillion in Market Cap, AMZN Now Down $1+ Trillion

&gt; As we approach the end of 2022, below is an updated look at the drawdown in market cap that we've seen in the US equity space since major indices peaked on the first trading day of the year. Using the Russell 3,000 as a proxy, the US stock market has seen an $11.7 trillion drawdown from the peak on 1/3/22. The max drawdown was $13.6 trillion at the low on 9/30, so we've seen market cap increase by just under $2 trillion since then. In dollar terms, this drawdown has been more extreme than anything investors have ever experienced. That's pretty deflationary if you ask us!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/drawdownray.png))**

&gt; Of the $11.7 trillion drawdown in US equity market cap, just over $5 trillion of the drop has come from six companies! Below is a look at the six current and former ""trillion dollar market cap"" club members that have now collectively lost about $5.07 trillion in market cap from their peaks. As shown, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) have all lost at least $750 billion in market cap from their highs. And Amazon (AMZN) is the first to lose more than $1 trillion in market cap! Just a few years ago, no company had a market cap of more than a trillion dollars, and now we have a company that has lost more than a trillion dollars in market cap.

&gt; For all six of these companies, their current drawdowns are easily their biggest on record. Apple (AAPL) has lost $880 billion, Alphabet (GOOGL) is down $846 billion, Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA) are both down more than $760 billion, and Microsoft (MSFT) is down $784 billion even though it was down close to a trillion at its lows in November.

Some of you might have just completed your annual review, maybe got a promotions/raises/bonus. Given the state of the economy, where do you see yourself putting your hard earned money to work?  


Below are my 2cents on a few areas I've been thinking about. Imo, the fed will not cut rates over the next year. Even with softening CPI, at best the FED will keep rates the same (lesson learned from the 70s double top).  


**Please chime in/share thoughts/rip me apart, etc.** 

  
Private Ventures:  
Entrepreneurs, partnerships, reselling etc. Private ventures is at the top of my list atm, (investing in early stage businesses with a high enough margin of safety)

Housing Market:   
Prices have been coming down dramatically in the covid era havens (L.A., Atlanta, many parts of FL).  At today's 30yr fixed rate^(1) with 20% down, that equates to buying the house 2x over, (500k sale = +500k in interest accrued). Investment property makes sense given the circumstances (*know what a good deal is, or get lucky*) - I'm hoping to get super lucky and learn to spot a deal throughout the process. 

Stocks/Bonds:  
Sure, 401k contributions and a handful of names. Wasn't planning on exceeding 20% of allocations, but things  change. I am interested in hearing your thoughts!

Savings/CDs:  
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't heavily invested here. So simple and financially irresponsible to choose a near 0% checking over a high yield savings for idle cash. I like Marcus by Goldman 3.20% as of today's date, bonus of 4.2% with their referral program^(2)

&gt;Brokered CD's have been \~4.60% - 4.75% for 9-12 month CDs. For those wondering what a brokered CD is, search for it on Investopedia^(3), superior to opening a CD at your local bank. 

Crypto:  
I am far from an expert. I've bought BTC at $99 and well into the $50k range. All things considered, this hasn't outperformed any of the aforementioned for me, relative to the risk. I'll still dabble, but don't expect allocations to be more than 5%.

personalfinance,Rent out or sell? (Las Vegas - Great Falls),"Is it worth renting out our house in Las Vegas when we move to Montana in about 9 months? (Thru a property manager) Or should we sell and move the profits to the next house? We got incredibly lucky buying when price and interest rates were low (bought 1998 sq. ft at $312,500 VA loan 0% down with a 2.375 interest rate) albeit price is going back down.. meanwhile rates are up (similar houses sold in last 90 days ranged from 390k-450k) 

Doing my own research it seems renting out presents potential high risk on a very non-liquid asset, is it better to keep maxing out our IRA/other tax advantaged retirement accounts? If we rent it out, the property is in a good location and close enough to Nellis Air Force base that we would plan to rent it out to military families to hopefully decrease our risk. Not to mention keeping a property with a very low interest rate.

economy,Inflation is a symptom of a larger problem we have,"Cost of living in 1945:

New house-4,600
New car-1,020
College 630 a year 

Inflation is a symptom of a much larger problem we have. And that problem is a spending problem. Why are cars, houses, and college are so much more expensive now then in the 40s and 50s is because we are willing to pay that much. Our appetite for more and more things we can’t afford is growing year after year. Cars were typically bought in cash as luxury items, till people who couldn’t afford them wanted them and thus the auto loan industry was born. Same with houses before the 1930s if you couldn’t afford a home in cash you were SOL but the the mortgage was born now people are willing to pay anything for a house thats why a home that just a few years ago was 180,000 is now 300,000. College used to be dirt cheap but instead of kids going to cheap schools, they wanted schools with awesome amenities and are willing to pay 20,000 a semester for them and thus student loans are born. The credit card was invented in the 50s. The suburbs and houses began to boom in the 50s the federal government approved student loans in the 60s this is when it all went to shit. The bank’s own us and they want us perpetually working in their servitude. Americans Personal debt is at 16.5 trillion we keep adding to it, putting our lives on credit. we keep borrowing our futures, and it becomes a vicious cycle. Yet we don’t care we want more and more regardless of interest rates, regardless of price we are addicted to things we can’t afford and prices will go up and up because we don’t mind paying it. We need to teach money management in schools as a necessity. We need to teach kids how to save money, and how to avoid debt. We need to break the cycle",finance,1671861995

solar,Help deciding on quotes / SMA string VS Chilcon or Enphase micros?,"Hello I need help deciding on the solar design on my house (SCE territory in California)  

I think I’ve found the installer I want to go with, a local company who came recommended by a contractor I know.   This is the local installer’s quote for a 12.6 kW array:

**Purchase Price: $37,800 including 200 Amp panel Swap**
Two SMA Sunny Boy Inverters

* 1 x SB3.0-1 SP-US-41 [240V] 3 kW
* 1 x SB7.0-1SP-US-41 [240V] 7 kW

* Panels
28 X 450 Watt Canadian Solar CS3W-450MB-AG 

Tax Credit: $11,340.00

**Net System Cost: $26,460.00 for a 12.6 kW array** 


We spoke for a long time and he said he recommended the SMA Sunny Boy inverter over Micro inverters since my roof has avoidable shading. He said if I really wanted micro inverters to go with Chilicon over Enphase since they have a higher build quality (metal vs plastic case, two panels per inverter, made in USA vs China etc) but the micro inverters will be less efficient, more expensive and vulnerable to communications issues and glitches.    

My concern is that every other quote I've gotten has been for some combination of Enphase IQ8s with various panels, for example:


**Blalock: 12.4 kW array Purchase Price: $37,800 including 200 Amp panel Swap**

* 31 x Enphase IQ8

* 31 x Hanwha Q CELLS 400 Black

* 1 x Enphase Envoy

Purchase Price: $37,800 including 200 Amp panel Swap

Federal Tax Credit: $11,340.00

**Net System Cost: $26,460.00 for 12.4 kW**


**Or** 


**NRG 12.4 kW array Purchase Price: $42,048 including 200 Amp panel Swap**

* 31 x Enphase IQ8

* 31 x Hyundai 400 Black

* 1 x Enphase Envoy


Federal Tax Credit $12,614

**Net System Cost: $29,434 for 12.4 kW**


How do you choose between SMA string, Chilcon micros and Enphase micros?

I’m leaning towards the SMA string setup since the inverters aren’t maxed out so it would be inexpensive to add panels in the future if we get EVs and less likely to kick us out of NEM 2.0 grandfathering.  But everyone doing residential rooftop these days seems to be all about Enphase micros.

personalfinance,I’m American and just found out the country I’m living in has savings accounts with 15-20% interest rates. Trying to figure out what the catch is…,"I’m living in a kind of third world country (one if the stans) and the biggest banks are offering interest rates of 15-20%. These accounts come with requirements that are high for the general economic situation here but pretty low bar for an American income (maintaining a few hundred dollars balance). As far as I can tell there are no fees.

The currency here fluctuates compared to USD, but as far as I can tell, not that much. The difference between the high and low this year represents a drop of about 5.5% vs USD (it has since recovered and is at a 3% drop YTD compared to USD currently), but even if you invested at the peak and cashed out at the worst time that would still come out to like a 13% annual gain (unless I’m doing the numbers wrong).

So yeah, I’m not sure if the confidence/perceived risk is just really bad or if there’s something major I’m missing. In general the country actually seems poised in a somewhat positive trend, having recently taken in a huge amount of Russian refugees who largely bring a higher income history, education, etc. compared to locals. 

At a glance this sounds way too good to be true, which to me means it is. What else should I be looking at?",finance,1671874176
cybersecurity,Returning to IT/Cyber after giving up due to toxicity,"TLDR at bottom, sorry for length and venting 

I went to a community college after wasting my early/mid 20s and I finally got tired of working in the food service industry. It was blood, sweat, and tears doing night classes while working full time but I managed to graduate at the exact beginning of quarantine in May 2020. It is just an associate degree, but very specifically a Cybersecurity degree from a recognized/respected program. A decent chunk of my classmates went the defense contractor route but I had doubts about passing a polygraph so I never went for it. Had a 3.4 gpa and graduated with a Security+ and ISACA’s Cybersecurity Fundamentals certificate, as well as two additional certificates issued by the school itself. I completed the coursework for A+ and Network+ but couldn’t afford to take the tests at the time.
I also had a paid summer internship at the school doing small time cloud development projects, worked their help desk for a semester, and I was also as active as possible in related extracurriculars like university-level CTF competitions and getting elected into an officer position in the IT club. I genuinely loved the work and couldn’t wait for the future even though my non-existent free time prevented me from networking outside the school with most of my classmates. System hardening was my favorite and I dreamed of a Blue Team career.

I got hired two months before my graduation date by a cloud startup MSP. I was so desperate for a foothold in the industry I ignored all the red flags. The following six months were so bad I sincerely wanted to jump into oncoming traffic. 60 hour weeks every two weeks, 13 hour shifts with no overtime as a minimum wage hourly employee. literally ZERO training was provided, and there was only ever one person per shift in a 24/7 support environment. This was also not a tier 1 role as I was expected to do everything from AD account provisioning, all aspects of desktop support, things like data restoration, virtual domain management, even feeble attempts at incident response when a client got hit with ransomware. I was responsible for supporting and maintaining infrastructure for close to 10 different businesses. Every second of every day was miserable but I thought I was “paying my dues”. I managed to absorb all the information I could and learned from every failed project, every unsolved support request, and every new technology I came across until I finally snapped and quit after having my first honest to god panic attack. 

Fortunately I quickly got offered another Tier 1 role contracted out to a less-popular Federal agency. Still horrible pay but it was no longer minimum wage and had a small amount of prestige cuz government. This role was not really a tier 1 either and a lot of the work would now be considered Tier 2/access control. Primarily dealt with PKI/certificates, file permissions, AD accounts, VPN and MDM stuff while fielding the phone for desktop support issues. I had an okay amount of mentoring this time and I enjoyed working with my fellow contractors. While I had issues with the unrealistic workload expectations like doing a remote session over the phone while doing a different remote session with someone else via chat. This was a daily occurrence. the dealbreaker was incredibly hostile and borderline abusive treatment from the actual Federal employees. It is not an exaggeration to say they hated us contractors. I didn’t even think workplaces that toxic actually existed. We were routinely insulted, the women on the team were sexually harassed and had their personal cell numbers leaked, and we were regularly used as the scapegoat for the failings of the Federal IT teams after being set up for failure. The agency who contracted us out refused to make any waves since the contract was up for renewal so once again I quit after 6 months.

This time I fell into a deep depression since I had worked so, so hard to get into this industry only to have it leave me an empty shell of a person.  I moved back in with my folks and took a full year off to deal with my destroyed mental health. Swore I would never even think about IT again.

Decided to try a new career out and got hired at a very large finance company. I studied hard and earned a bunch of new certifications/licenses related to investing and insurance. The reason I only lasted 6 months at this job is pretty simple. I was misled about the nature of the work and it turned out to be mostly selling snake oil. Anybody here tasked with selling annuities knows what I’m talking about.

It has now been a few months since then, and I feel incredibly lost, aimless, and hopeless. I genuinely miss the actual work part of IT/Cyber but its been long enough that I’ve forgotten a lot of the specific technical information like power shell syntax, what port number has which function, how to quickly navigate AD, just things of that nature.

I took a look on LinkedIn and could not believe the sheer number of job postings for cyber that have popped up in the last two years. I live near a HCOL city so that definitely is a part of it but there has to be at least 15 jobs per fresh graduate. Two common positions I think I may be qualified for are IAM or Cybersecurity Analyst. The requirements and salaries are all over the place and most likely made up by uninformed HR managers so it’s hard for me to tell what’s realistic and what is not. For instance i came across  a security analyst position at a bank offering 100k base with the only listed qualifications as “0-2 years experience, CISSP preferred ”

I desperately want to get back into the industry but I am really worried about having to explain the job hopping, resume gaps, and my brief trip into the world of finance. Not to mention how rusty my skill set has become convincing I’ll bomb any technical interview. At best they will think I’m lazy and couldn’t handle the job, at worst they will think I’m lying about how horrible my previous jobs were. Does the fact that I’ve never been fired from a job help my case at all? I also worked for the same restaurant for close to 5 years before graduating, and I have passed almost every non-polygraph background check at both the fed and individual state level including Public Trust.

TLDR;

I want to get back into cybersecurity after my first two jobs completely broke me to the point I took a year off and then switched to finance for 7 months. Is it possible for me to get a position that isn't a high-volume call center even though my resume is spotty and makes me  look like a job hopper? It is my DREAM to work a job for more than 6 months. I have an extremely diverse IT skillset with over two years paid experience and closer to 5 including all the unpaid hands-on training in school. I also have  multiple credentials in cybersecurity, finance, and insurance. 
 
I just really need some guidance on how to find a decent position with the experience I do have like IAM or Cybersecurity Analyst. I will do anything for a cyber position that does not include the phrase “First point of contact”. Also maybe some words of encouragement to stop this impostor syndrome and shut up the voice in my head telling me I’m the dumbest person who ever lived and I’m doomed to go back to waiting tables for the rest of my life.

I sincerely appreciate any guidance the seasoned professionals may be able to provide.

Edit: 
Here is the rundown of my resume. Furthermore, regarding the contractor position, I was told I was Tier 1, I was paid as Tier 1, the offer letter I signed states the position as Tier 2, and the position is currently listed on indeed as Tier 2 when it was Tier 1 when I applied. I don't know if that means I can honestly say I have Tier 2 experience on my resume but I'm really starting to think they scammed me.

Age: Late 20s

Debt: None (other than a mortgage at 3.5% interest)

Income: $130k (I work multiple remote jobs so I’m currently making ~$410k across all of them but I not quite sure how stable that will be. However based on how things have been going over the past few years, I’ll likely be making around this much for at least another few years)

Expenses: $3,500/mo all-in

Savings Rate: $4,000/mon (53% savings rate) counting only my primary job ($20,000/mon (85% savings rate) total counting all my jobs)

Current Net Worth: ~$250,000 as of last month (it was in the mid-$300k range last year before the market began dropping)

Other: One of jobs is at a startup and the RSUs I have received could be worth anywhere from $3k to $100k+ in 2-3y when it vests. It’s a highly volatile stock and just in the past few years the value of my shares have swung between $3k and close to $100k. 

——-

I currently have an opportunity to borrow $50k-$100k at an interest rate of 7%. Since the market is heavily down right now, I’m thinking about borrowing this money to invest into the stock market. Specifically I would buy QQQ, a tech-heavy ETF. From the current price of QQQ back up to it’s all-time high from last year, there’s a 50% upside potential. Doing the math with borrowing at 7%, I’ll be profitable if QQQ were to go back to it’s all-time high sometime in the next 6y (which I believe to be a reasonable, but certainly not guaranteed, outcome)

The biggest risks I see with this plan are:

1) The market continues dipping in the short term (I’m perfectly ok with high volatility and can cover any margin calls in case it were to happen, even if I were to lose 1 or even all of my multiple jobs at the same time (I’m constantly interviewing to keep my skills sharp so I regularly get new job offers)) 

2) QQQ never goes back to all-time highs (theoretically could happen, but I believe it to be highly unlikely)

personalfinance,Realize capital gains and/or convert regular IRA's now or later,"Me and my wife are retired and we have very little income (10-15K annually from dividends and rental). I am wondering if I should realize capital gain in my taxable accounts (and or perform regular IRA to Roth IRA conversions). I could realize capital gains and pay zero tax as long as I stay within the 15% capital gains tax amounts. I could also perform the regular IRA to Roth conversion to increase income from 10-15K up to 25.9K which is the standard deduction for married couple. In doing either or both of those things, I can pay zero federal tax on that income. The only problem is that I would have to pay the Louisiana state tax now instead of possibly many years later such that I wouldn't have the use of that money that could have grown over time. That growth may be more than the tax savings I would have by paying no federal tax now especially if I still get the same zero tax later when I would take it out.  


I will have to start taking RMD's on my regular IRA's at age 72 and I am 59 now. Also, I probably would not need to start taking social security until age 70.

stocks,"Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Stock Review 12/24/22","As always, below represents my opinions and should not be construed as financial advise. Always do you own due dilligence. I welcome your feedback of my opinions.

· **Company Description**

o ELI5 the company’s business model

§ Tesla primarily designs, develops and manufactures fully electronic vehicles and has a smaller solar generation and battery storage business. They are currently investing into self-driving vehicles and humanoid robots.

· **Company Soundness**

o How does the company collect revenue? Does the company have a good or services that is purchased frequently or a regular interval?

§ Tesla sells their products Direct to consumer. Their cars and solar options are purchased directly on their website. Most of the products they sell are durable goods. That is to say they are high ticket items that are often purchased once and without a frequent and recurring interval. Having said that, since Tesla is vertically integrated, they also have the potential to grow a larger service revenue stream for their products.

o Do they operate with significant leverage?

§ Very little. Tesla uses a meager $0.14 of debt for every $1 of equity on their balance sheet. This compares with 3.08 to 1 at Ford 1.76 to 1 at GM. Consequently, they have an extremely high 56x interest coverage ratio.

o Is their balance sheet will suited for a downturn and why?

§ Yes, between the low debt and significant cash cushion they are well cushioned. This is evidenced by $19.5 billion in cash, $2.41 billion in unused credit lines. Additionally, Tesla is cash flow positive with the widest cash flow margins in the industry. Tesla expects Capex to be 6-8 billion over next two years. Management reported on their September 22 10-Q that they believe they have sufficient capital to fund their growth plans.

§ They do have $983 million of debt due in the next 12 months which is easily covered from their cash stash or through a refinance and extension of maturity.

· **Can it be Replicated?**

o Is there evidence that the company has defended its market position in the past?

§ None. Tesla is a new company and electric vehicles within transportation is a new industry. Having said that, history of the auto industry suggests high barriers. You have a business with large, fixed costs, a cyclical product and need some level of scale to allow customers to believe they can get it serviced.

§ Additionally, like capitalism often does, high returns attract new capital and bring about lower returns. The flight of capital has been seen; the question is will new players be able to make enduring franchises in a historically tough market?

o Is there evidence that market power is growing and that this will lead to strong financials?

§ Yes. Tesla now has enough scale to rival legacy auto manufacturers. They crush Ford and GM in virtually every financial metric. (TSLA, F, GM is the order of the following)

§ Gross Margin: 26.6%, 11.4%,13.6%

§ ROA: 17%, 3.5%, 3.8%

§ FCF margin: 11.9%, 1.7%, 0.8%

o What is the competitive advantage?

§ In my view, they have two advantages at this point: low-cost provider and Intangible assets

§ Low-Cost Provider:

· Relative to legacy players, Tesla has a lower cost operating model. For example, by selling 100% of their cars DTC they can sell them at retail prices to consumer whereas legacy auto sells their cars to dealers at wholesale prices. During a recessionary period, this will serve to benefit Tesla. As customers defer purchases of cars, prices will typically fold (this has started to occur with the most recent series of inflation reports) When you have 22% gross margins and 12% FCF margins, you can drop prices far lower and be profitable than when your competitors are at \~12% gross margins and \~1% free cash flow margins.

· It appears that this advantage is not done being flexed. Even with a lower overall volume of cars being sold combined with a significantly higher growth rate, Tesla’s revenue/employee continues to soar. Currently it is about the same as Ford and GM. I would expect in future years with additional growth, Tesla will surpass them.

§ Intangibles

· As a brand, Tesla is the undisputed leader in EVs. Having said that, Elon’s moves into twitter and more importantly politics of late have caused some people to put their nose up at Tesla. I personally feel this will be a passing thing, particularly as Elon has announced his intent to step down as CEO of twitter, although that does not mean he will stop tweeting. Despite this headwind, Elon and Tesla have been able to grow the brand through fanfare and organic attention rather than spending blocks of marketing dollars.

· Vertical integration. Tesla owns production and the service center network. This has allowed them to offer far better services. Currently, when your Tesla is in the shop, they attempt to give all customers fully loaded up-to-date versions of their current car to get them to salivate for an upgrade. They also make house calls and are sometimes able to repair your car in your driveway. Additionally, by vertically integrating the design and production process, they own the IP for the core components of the EVs. This gives them another cost advantage. They put the core components of their cars in at cost, other players put them in at a markup from their suppliers.

· First mover advantage. Tesla has outfitted with what they believe to be the necessary equipment for self-driving technology since October of 2016. This allowed them to have customers subsidize the cost by buying the car and gave them more data than any other company to develop this highly complicated technology. They also have a large charging network. Admittedly this benefit will likely lessen as the charging network infrastructure matures.

· Legacy costs. As in Tesla has none of them, whereas legacy auto has all the transition issues. Imagine trying to be Ford or GM and you know the future is EVs. What do you do with your unionize gas engineers? Will a layoff cause a strike? You know that selling through dealers puts you at a cost disadvantage, how do you cut them out of the deal? States have regulations that don’t allow dealers and manufactures to be owned by the same entity. How do you cut out dealers for sales but keep them for service? How do you solve the above issues while also maintaining profitability because you are heavily indebted in a fairly high interest rate environment? These aren’t so much strengths of Tesla, but are weaknesses of legacy auto.

· It is really hard to put into words all the changes Tesla has made. For example, they sell cars on their website without a model year advertised. This small but subtle change should help deal with the seasonality affect of ordering. Additionally, they have been able to add differentiated features to the car that nobody else has done before causing viral free advertising just for being cool. Ludicrous mode with the Spaceballs animation, verbal commands like “open your butthole” to access the charging port. It’s a joke, I get it, but it creates real buzz and interest.

o Would $10 billion of capital be enough to re-create the company?

§ No, you would likely need far more. As of now, $26 billion has been put into to Rivian and expects to produce 25,000 cars this year. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of new brands or the ability for players to scale up in the auto industry for such a long period of time is suggestive of the very real barriers. With higher rates and a recession looming, capital may be more difficult to come by for smaller less established players.

o Are parts of the company not able to be recreated with capital? Which parts and why?

§ To be honest, much of the company could be replicated with capital. The big thing, is there are really no other major players who have been able to do it anywhere near as close to the scale with the financial success as Tesla.

o Are there competitive threats on the horizon?

§ Several. This is a big industry going through a significant change. When these things happen, that attracts a significant amount of capital and competition. Every major auto company is investing into EVs, new entrants are entering the space and even large competitors like Apple are looking to enter.

· **Growth**

o Is there a 90% chance that earnings will be up 5 years from now?

§ Yes, Tesla is still a relatively small player in the auto space and has great trends with past growth and future expectations.

o Is there a 50% chance earnings will continue to grow in excess of 7% per year after the 5 year period?

§ Yes, they have a long pipeline ahead of them and have investments that offer many call options on their business.

· **Watch List Decision**

o Do you honestly know enough about the industry and company to make an investment decision?

§ Kind of. Tesla is extremely complicated, operating in new industries with new technology. Its hard to say with confidence that I have a solid understanding of the factors given the increasing rate of change with energy production and auto.

o Bottom Line: Based on your answers is the company well insulated from economic and competitive shocks while able to grow for many years to come?

§ Given the competitive strengths combined with the many weaknesses of the legacy operators I feel there is a real chance to cement an advantage in this rapidly evolving space.

§ It is also worth pointing out that long term, I feel the auto industry will go on to have similar economics of the aerospace industry. In the highly regulated aerospace industry, engines are often sold at breakeven or even a loss but come with highly lucrative 20-year service contracts making for high margin recurring revenue which gives these companies much of their value. While it is unlikely that auto will get as regulated as aerospace, I do think that the car itself over time will be more and more commoditized. The breadcrumbs for this are there. Tesla could have franchised service centers to grow with far less capex, but they didn’t. Tesla could have avoided the auto insurance like every other car company, but they are pursuing it. Obviously, the holy grail in the industry is self-driving. Conquering that gives an obvious service revenue stream for customers who purchase this add-on. Additionally, they can collect transportation fees on a robo-taxi network. Self-driving and the data from it obviously gives them a leg up on legacy insurance companies in evaluating the risk of their drivers.

§ When you put the clear cost advantage with the breadcrumbs to build the future, I think it is fair to say that Tesla earns a well deserved spot on a watch list.

· **Valuation**

o Value the company

§ Ha! Difficult, very difficult!

§ 2022 Rev Expectations: $83.075 billion

§ 2025 Rev Expectations: $167.5 Billion (26% CAGR)

§ 2028 rev Expectations: $315.7 Billion (23.5% CAGR from ’25 to ’28)

§ Shares outstanding as of 10/18/22 were 3,157,752,449

§ Over the past 6 months shares have increased at an annual rate of \~2.0%

§ Over the past 3 years they have increased at an annual rate of \~5.4%

§ Elon has discussed, but not started a buyback. Given their additional scale, and sufficient capital, I think it is prudent to project a lesser share count increase going forward. I will assume a 1% to 4% increase in shares.

§ This implies shares outstanding of 3.253 billion to 3.552 billion 3 years from now.

§ Since scale had been achieved, FCF margins have increased steadily to 11.9%. While a recession is likely to lower margins, long term additional service revenues and scale could easily raise them. I think a midpoint expectation of 14% with a range of 7% to 21% is probably fair.

§ To model a bear scenario I assumed a 25% reduction in revenue for the 2025 target to model effects from a recession and slower rollout of self-driving. For a bull case I assumed a 10% premium to the revenue target to assume better adoption. This gives us a revenue range $127.5 billion and $187.1 billion for ’25.

§ At a 7% FCF margin with 3.552 billion shares outstanding on revenue of $125.6 billion we get FCF per share of $2.46 in our bear case. With a 21% FCF margin on $184.2 billion of revenue with 3.253 billion shares we get a bullish FCF per share of 11.88.

§ With growth expectations in 2028 slowing but still high overall, I will assume a FCF yield between 2.5% to 5% for 2025.

§ When you put it all together you get an estimated value in 2025 of $98 to $237 per share for a mid-point of $168.05

§ With a current price of $123, this implies an annual return of 12% per year at the midpoint from these levels. The bull case implies a 25% CAGR and the bear case implies a loss of 6% per year.

o Would it be a prudent investment to buy the company at current levels?

§ For me, I feel that given the uncertainty in the future of the industry and company overall I would want to earn a 15% per year on an investment on Tesla. Currently, my estimates suggest a 12% rate of return. To potentially earn 15%, Tesla would need to be purchased for a price less than $112. This leaves it marginally overvalued. It really boils down to what it always does, if you believe they will execute on the vision that has been laid out. If that is the case, gains will likely be quite nice from these levels.

stocks,Personal Portfolio strategy going forward,"Hello all fellow investors,
I’ve decided to share my thoughts on my portfolio allocation and strategy moving forward. 

💰Portfolio allocation 

•30% in alternative investments I cannot discuss here 


•30% TSLA/growth stocks
At these levels Tesla could 3x again just by revisiting ATH. They are in a good position, growth wise and I’m a long term believer in the company. There are also other growth stocks I may want to add as well and I would group LEAPS into this category as well. Growth stocks offer lots of volatility and thus the option premiums are higher. I will sell covered calls on parts of my position and if I’m called away I’ll revert to selling cash secured puts. If I’m unable to get back in then I’m fine with that because I’ll always keep my other position naked. 

•0-10% cash
I’ve never kept cash on the side and mainly got mines from my paycheck or selling other investments. However I think it’s good to keep some dry powder. During bear markets I can use this cash on T-Bills, BIL, or leaving it in a money market account. During bull markets I can dump it into spy, use it to sell puts, or invest it into growth stocks or safer assets. I say 0-10% because I would want to be fully invested once the fed pivots. 

•30% safe assets 
In this bucket I keep assets that are widely considered safe. Here is where I’ll hold real estate, spy, value stocks, etc. Investing into these types of assets is a good idea because they don’t drop as much during bear markets and they steadily climb. Additionally, the very best investment one could make is in the spy. If one invests into the spy, then by definition they’re going to trail the market. 

I have to be honest with myself and note that I don’t always beat the market and when I do it sometimes isn’t by a wide margin. We’re all here to make money and sometimes that means doing the most layman thing of holding index funds. By having some allocation into spy I’ll have peace of mind when it comes to not falling behind the markets own rate of return. 

📈Basic portfolio strategy going forward

Furthermore, right now my strategy is to hoard cash and wait for a fed pivot once either inflation stays down at 2% and/or unemployment spikes. Until either of those things happen, I’m not expecting a fed pivot anytime soon. I have been averaging down into some positions like alternative investments and Tesla, but nothing too crazy. The lion share of my positions are just cash. 

I have learned that you do not want to fight the fed under any circumstances. They control the money and thus control the investing world. For instance, the Singaporean stock market has gone nowhere because Singapore does not have QE. Same goes for other international indexes. Liquidity drives markets first and foremost. No liquidity, no capital appreciation. 

-When they pivot to a hawkish stance I will sell out of all of my investments and go into short term government bonds until they pivot. Synthetic shorts, covered calls, go into effect here. No DCA

-When they pivot to a dovish stance, use 90% of cash to buy growth and other high alpha names and then slowly stop buying growth and begin adding value. This is because growth will outperform value when the fed first pivots so I don’t want to have much value stocks. I will DCA throughout the expansion.

This strategy isn’t perfect but all booms and bust in the most recent decades have been because of the fed inducing them. A fed pivot means a change in trend. And you reduce a lot of risk if you invest accordingly. 


In closing, I hope this sub can stand to benefit from my opinions. I’m open to criticism. DYOR and invest safe.

Edit: removed 10x of TSLA stock from these levels of it were to hit ath again. I was thinking about it bottoming out around 60$/share.",finance,1671897690
investing,Pros and Cons of investing into banking sector in times of increasing interest rates,"Hi everybody,

One sector that I think of as promising in times of rising interest rates is the banking system. However in my bubble I have hardly heard of anyone betting on banks &amp; financial industry segment lately. 

I find it quite plausible that institutional investors have to rotate out of stocks &amp; real estate as those become more turbulent. Thanks to higher interest rates increasingly appealing banking &amp; insurance products should be the first in line to scoop up investors money providing safe and stable investments. Therefore, profitability in banks &amp; financial services should increase. 

I'm aware that banks also face defaults on their loans as some companies might go bankrupt. However, I would expect the banks secured profitability to outweight the risks.

Since banking stocks have not spicked significantly for the last year it seems the financial market does not evaluate the situation as I do. 

What do you guys think? Is the pick of an banking and / or financial services ETF promising at the moment?

Looking forward to hearing your pro and cons.",finance,1671897778

vet,Senior Cat Showing Some Odd Symptoms,"Context: my cat is a 13 y/o altered female with a history of digestive issues. Last year she had an ultrasound that was generally clear, aside from a thickening observed in her small intestines. The vet assumed it was IBD. After a great deal of trial and error, my cat was placed on prescription z/d wet food, bio sponge powder, and compounded steroids. She did fine, just had some flare-ups of diarrhea and vomiting every now and then, which either passed on their own or were treated with an increased dose of steroids. 

Two months ago, I was hospitalized for a week. My mother did not give my cat her steroids for that entire week. And my cat did absolutely fine. I was dumbfounded.

The remaining money that went into my bank account was exactly $4,368.60.

I would also frequently buy and sell assets within the Roth (sold Mutual fund VTSAX to buy individual stocks).

QUESTIONS:

I understand that there is a penalty of of withdrawing from the Roth before 59.5. Was the $485.40 federal withhold that penalty?

Is there a way I can avoid taxes if I withdrew due to homelessness? How would I file this?

Do I have to pay taxes on $4,854?

Do I have to pay taxes when I trade from a mutual fund (VTSAX) to individual stocks but still within the Roth IRA account?

Do I have to pay taxes if I trade one stock for another stock within the Roth IRA? Or do I only pay taxes on what I withdraw from the Roth IRA account?",finance,1671906240
investing,Turkish stocks made 100% gains and I'm afraid.,"Turkish stock market made 100% gains within this year in USD. This is caused by extremely low interest rates. Government is set to keep interest rates low and dollar/try exchange rate stable for another 6 months till the elections. (By selling LOTS OF dollars with borrowed from foreign countries.)

A lot of Turkish investors/fund managers think this is free money to be made hence are bullish about the next 6 months of our markets. Though, I doubt making money can be this easy because low interest rates are already priced in and foreign investment is still avoiding our stocks.

solar,Incentives for non-profits,"My church in AZ is interested in purchasing solar. From what I understand the 30% federal ITC is available for entities with taxable income, which a non-profit such as my church wouldn’t qualify for.

I did some research about this Inflation Reduction Act and there are websites that suggest that, thanks to this Act, non-profits would also be eligible for the 30% ITC starting in 2023. Some other websites offer a bit more convoluted solution (such as putting the panels in someone else’s name, doing a PPA, financing with a bank that is agreement to return the ITC to the non-profit, etc.). 

Point is, I’m not finding anything that I can feel confident about saying one way or another about the current or future solar incentives for non-profits.

I’m hoping if anyone knows of any incentives that are/will be available for non-profits purchasing solar, as well as if anyone knew if they could be eligible for claiming depreciation or any other tax benefits for their system once it’s installed.",energy,1671908250

solar,I think I got taken for a ride,"Alright, first off, I was sold on a system by a lumio rep (formerly akc) during a neighborhood sweep in florida. Probably should have known better but we will see.

PV Size: 6.4 kw 
Est. Annual Production: 9323 kWh 
Solar Panels: Hanwha Q.PEAK DUO BLK ML-G10+ 400 
Inverter: Enphase IQ8PLUS-72-2-US

Turn on was mid July, and so far I have gotten 3.6mWh so I do not believe I am on track to meet that annual production.

Price was roughly 36k for the whole system, and I'll get the tax credit. I got a 1.5% interest rate, so my payment is $106 which will balloon to $154 if I don't put the credit in (which I won't because there's no way to finance at that interest rate. I'll likely just throw it into an investment somewhere.)

I do still have a Solar Bill, and they told me I would no longer have a bill based on this production. Truth is, I don't think they looked at historical usage at all because I consume roughly 12mWh a year. They took some pictures but did the math wrong. I looked only at the monthly price and didn't double check their math.

It I look at the price I am offsetting on my bill, it comes out to just around the cost I am paying on the loan. My bill has decreased by roughly $106 a month, so I am near breakeven if I pay in the tax credit. Wondering what recourse I have if I was sold a bad deal. Price gouging, pitch a fit for a few more Panels to meet the production they sold me, etc. Overall it's not a huge loss per month. Totalled up it's under $100 a year if I did my math right. But it leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I guess I am here to see if I should be mad and go after the company for more, or if that wouldn't be reasonable. I have the 1 to 1 in florida and they said I would build a buffer that would offset my bill after a few months but that's clearly not going to happen at this point as I still have an energy bill between $60-$100 a month.",energy,1671913418

Here we go:  
  
Santa faced the grinch, and pulled out his yuletide log. ""ohhhh yeahhhh you little green booyyy"" he whispered sensually. Santa felt his crotch jump and flex beneath his costume as his milkers begged for his attention. With a quick tug and a whisper, Santa popped his neck at the grinch, ""I got a big milker for you. He's called Mr Tiddlywinks, because he's a tiddy and if you look really closely he winks at you."" the grinch was visibly aroused. Santa had never known milkers to get this excited about a man. Santa shook his head as he closed his cape and he put on a big smile. ""I guess Santa's gonna have to get up in the morning. I'll make cream pie."" he winked, and went to bed.  
  
The next morning, the grinch was horny. verryyyy horny. He looked down at Mr Tiddlywinks' cute little milkers and his prick started to tent. Mr Tiddlywinks was getting engorged. The grinch wondered if he was hard enough to milk him or not. ""But,"" the grinch finished his train of thought, ""If i stick him in my ass, it's all over for him.""  
  
The grinch started stuffing his fat mother's tits with lard as he drove to mommy's house. ""Oooooohhh you mommy's tits, warm and yummy milkers for a baby!"" he whispered to himself gleefully. He was so hard that his erect penis lodged itself in the steering wheel, and he crashed his car. The force of the impact made him ejaculate all over the steering wheel, to which his mother commented, ""why don't you take that stuffed teddy bear and go make some milkers for him."" The grinch ignored her comment, and he drove to mommy's in his other car, which he didn't normally use because it was caked in cum. Specifically, cum from the Seven Dwarves. Snow white had been very nice and given him half price. She was a good pimp.  
  
The grinch stormed into mommy's house, with his bulging dick swinging like a pendulum. ""My mommy's tits, lovey!"" he moaned, as he saw his mommy's breasts. He was incredibly horny, and his asshole resembled the eye of sauron. ""Mordor looks nice this time of year"" his mother exclaimed as she instantly came. His milkers loved milk, and milked their new owner to absolute exhaustion. By the time he made it to his bedroom, he was very fatigued and ill. After a quick rest he got up and went to make milkies.  
  
The milkies however contained high doses of cyanide. He looked at his book about serial killers to make sure that he was doing it right. The first page read:  
  
A serial killer is typically a person who murders three or more persons,\[1\] with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant period of time between them.\[1\]\[2\] While most authorities set a threshold of three murders,\[1\] others extend it to four or lessen it to two.\[3\]  
  
Psychological gratification is the usual motive for serial killing, and many serial murders involve sexual contact with the victim.\[4\] The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) states that the motives of serial killers can include anger, thrill-seeking, financial gain, and attention seeking, and killings may be executed as such.\[5\] The victims may have something in common; for example, demographic profile, appearance, gender or race.\[6\] Often the FBI will focus on a particular pattern serial killers follow.\[7\] Based on this pattern, this will give key clues into finding the killer along with their motives.\[8\]  
  
Although a serial killer is a distinct classification that differs from that of a mass murderer, spree killer, or contract killer, there exist conceptual overlaps between them. Some debate exists on the specific criteria for each category, especially with regard to the distinction between spree killers and serial killers.\[9\]  
  
Successful serial killers can usually blend into society and successfully kill two or more persons over a period of time. Serial killers often employ different modalities of murder to maximize their orgasm. Typically, they will use a knife, but guns and choking are used too.\[10\] There are four broad methods of killing: strangulation, stabbing, suffocation, and shooting. While the variety in methods is uuuuuuhhhhhh mommmmyyyyyyyyy y's milkers mmmmmmmmmmmmm, the success rate is very high. In fact, a serial killer has a 100 percent success rate, which is one of the highest in the history of the world.\[11\]  
  
Violence is the cornerstone of the serial killer's lifestyle. And in general, serial killers tend to be violent individuals.\[12\] It is no coincidence that they resort to violence so often; violent individuals are drawn to violent acts upon other individuals as a means of arousal, gratification, feeling safe, exhaustion, stress, relief from arousal, and perhaps alleviating personal suffocation.\[12\] Suicides bring escape psychologically and from throat cancer.\[12\] Success is cited to the chief cause of life ends through deviant social activities.\[12\] With the increasing crime rate decreasing as results potentially gaining integration.

He had a very arousing form of deja vu. ""Mmm mommy's tits. Warm and yummy milkers for a baby! Mommmy! Mommmy!"" He wanted to cum so badly now, and he thought about all the different ways that he could kill mommy, milkers. He was pretty sure that he had killed her once before. It was his birthday, and he was 11 years old. Mommy gave him a present, and his mother was there too, though she never did that kind of thing. Usually it was that all the The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with 1.3 billion baptized Catholics worldwide as of 2019.\[4\]\[7\] It is among the world's oldest and largest international institutions, and has played a prominent role in the history and development of Western civilization. cum tiddies. He put a wooden switch into the ham's sack, and then he grabbed his mother's tits and started squeezing them and slapping them in front of her, begging her to suckle him on her breasts. He watched her like a hunter watches a wild animal as he bit into his mother's nipples, pulling the flesh off her breasts with his teeth and pushing the nipples into his mother's mouth, sucking on them until they were semi-evaporated.  
  
Later that month, he met daddy daddy daddy. daddy daddy daddy was not really a daddy, or a daddy daddy, or even a daddy daddy daddy. But he did have a fat fucking cock. He sucked daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy's fat fucking cock, and it made the boy's pussy really wet. ""Oooooohhh I want my daddy milkers soooo badly! Fuck! I'm cumming. I'm cumming in daddy's fat cock. Ooooohhh cum in daddy's cock. Mommmy! Oooooohhh fuck mommy's milkers! Give me my daddy milkers!"" The boy yelled as he shook violently, trying to break free from his mother's pussy, ripping off his teddy bear to make milkers for daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy daddy.  
  
There was a little boy who walked alone to a grassy meadow in the early morning light. He saw the sun rise and begin to shine. In the cool breeze, he felt refreshed and totally calm. It was a perfect day, and the boy loved it. This is how he planned to make his dream come true. This is how he would meet his mommy milkers and make them his milkers.  
  
But as he walked to the meadow, a hickie suddenly appeared on his neck. The hickey looked like a little penis. A penis (plural penises or penes (/piːnɪs/) is the primary sexual organ that male animals use to inseminate females (or hermaphrodites) during copulation.\[1\]\[2\] Such organs occur in many animals, both vertebrate and invertebrate, but males do not bear a penis in every animal species, and in those species in which the male does bear a so-called penis, the penises in the various species are not necessarily homologous. The penis is usually reduced to that of one sex in species where the male is naturally female. Penises typically have one or two pairs of bulbs (or apertures) that are equipped with the foreskin that completely covers the bulb in a prominent fold of skin in males.\[8\] In the male the foreskin can sometimes be retracted to prevent excess rubbing.\[8\]\[9\]

personalfinance,Payoff Highest Interest Rate or Minimize Total Interest Paid?,"I'm trying to buy a house (likely a 500k mortgage) but have a nagging 50k student loan at 8.5% that I'm paying $550/mo for. I have the down payment saved up and am making about 160k/year. If I were to come into possession of another 50k through cashing out investments, would it make more sense to pay off the student loan or put it towards the house?

One school of thought would be to pay off the student loan since it has the smallest balance and highest rate (8.5% SL compared to hypothetical 6% mortgage). I have calculated that by paying off $50k of student loans, I would be saving $38.5k in lifetime interest. On the other hand, putting an extra 50k down on the house saves me about $58k in lifetime interest and lowers my monthly payment by $300/mo.

Banking,Is this kind of treatment working at a bank normal?,"I’m going to try to keep this as brief as possible(note; I failed lol)

I started a job as a part time teller at a smaller regional bank in March this year. At first everything was fine - the branch I worked at was staffed enough to get by and the other part time worker was reliable. There were also two full times, our lead teller and then the vault teller, as well as our CSR. 

Due to transportation issues I had to transfer to a branch that is less than 1/2 a mile from my place so I could bike or walk to work. Ever since I transferred to this other branch in June it’s been a nightmare. 

There is only our lead teller and another part timer as well as our CSR who is the “gap filler”and is frequently covering at other branches. The other part timer was the later shift and she was not very reliable, which caused obvious issues as far as closing since it’s policy that there has to be at least two people to close. 

I was asked frequently to come in early or stay late to help cover. Then that part timer quit in a single day and I was honestly relieved. Now we can find someone new who can actually come in regularly so I don’t have to cover all the time, right? Wrong. The next teller they hired is even worse about calling out randomly, leaving early, coming in late. He’s always got “something” going on and even tried to get me to work his Saturday bc he didn’t feel like it. 

Now I have been practically running the branch as my lead teller is out. I’m responsible for vault stuff, atm stuff, and will be working full time until he gets back. It’s just crazy the amount of responsibility they put on me (and the other teller who will be effectively running the branch with me has only been here since august!) 

I even asked my lead to ask our boss about potentially just hiring me full time. At least it would be better pay and I would get benefits like health insurance which I currently don’t have. Our boss said there is no way that’s going to happen. I’m honestly considering quitting because it’s just getting ridiculous imo. I signed up for this to be a chill part time job and they keep putting more and more responsibility on my plate. And I know it won’t stop because I will frequently be the only teller at our branch next year until the other part time teller shows up later in the day(if he shows up) because our lead has to start leaving for half of the day to train for CSR at another branch. 

To top it off, when we got that Siberian cold front our heat was out and it was 48 degrees in the building and even colder where I sit bc I sit at the drive up. My toes kept going numb and my legs were freezing cold and still my lead wouldn’t let me go home. And when I brought up that my stairs at my apartment complex were getting icy and I was concerned about being able to come in for my shift yesterday(my complex is bad about salting the stairs, I’ve been stranded in my unit bc of it before) our CSR told me  “well you’re just going to have to come in anyway, go buy salt”. Luckily it didn’t end up being an issue, I just wanted to know who to call if it was though and was told not coming in was just not an option. I straight up told our CSR that I’m not risking my neck going down two flights of ice covered stairs to get to work. 

I get paid $14.75 an hour. 

I guess I just want to know if this level of responsibility for part time tellers is normal? Or are they taking advantage of me? They are not preparing me to be a lead because I told them in no uncertain terms that I am *not* interested in being a lead. Yet I keep finding myself taking on lead responsibilities that I’m just not comfortable with and that I don’t personally think the pay is commensurate with.",finance,1671985357
stocks,Tesla stock collapse - All you need to know - Part 1,"Tesla ($TSLA) is down 69% YTD. Although this is a number that Elon musk normally finds funny, I think, in this case, he might make an exception.

In my opinion, there are 5 reasons that led to the collapse of the share price and the goal of this post is to lay them down as well as the impact of each.

***Part 2 will follow on the valuation in full (including all assumptions made) - This post became too long and in my experience, extremely long posts do poorly.***

&amp;#x200B;

**Reason #1: Elon Musk acquired Twitter - leading to him having less time available for Tesla**

Although Elon Musk is involved in many companies other than Tesla (SpaceX, The boring company, Neuralink), there is no doubt that Twitter is the one taking most of his time at this very moment. This acquisition wasn't welcomed by the shareholders of Tesla.

**The impact:** In my opinion, the role of Elon Musk in all companies is to find the right people for the right positions and assemble teams that do the job well. Then, it's all about translating his vision into actions. The better the teams are executing, the less Elon Musk is needed on daily basis. Although this event had an impact on the time he spends on Tesla, I'm sure if there's a critical decision, Elon will give priority to Tesla over Twitter. Hence, looking into the future, I cannot imagine that Tesla's performance (from a fundamental point of view) will deteriorate.

**Reason #2: Insiders selling**

Over the last 365 days, there has been a lot of insider selling.

Of course, it is obvious that the biggest sale was in order to acquire Twitter and most recently (in December) to secure more funds as Twitter is not profitable.

However, there have been many insiders in high-level positions who were selling shares and the average price is almost always above $250 (more than 2x where the share price is today). In my opinion, they were selling as the company was **overvalued.** Could I be wrong? Absolutely.

**The impact:** Economics101 - when there's a significant change in supply/demand, there's a change in the price. When there is over $24b worth of shares dumped on the market, it causes a decline in the share price. Was this a significant reason for the decline? Absolutely! Do I blame the insiders? Not really, it is their choice to sell shares. As for Elon, I don't think that if his ownership is up or down by a few %, it has an impact on the level of involvement.

**Reason #3: FED increase in interest rate**

So far, this is what Elon Musk has been pointing to the most as an explanation for the share price decline. Although the increase from 0% to 4% treasury rate has an impact on the valuation of companies, it **does not** justify a decrease of 69%. Blaming the rate hikes for a stock price fall is the same as saying the stock was overvalued before, based on artificially cheap money.

Elon Musk in a Twitter Space conversation referred to the real interest rate being close to 6%. What does this mean? The nominal interest rate is somewhere around 4%, which means, he believes the inflation is negative 2% - We're in deflation. In the same conversation, he mentioned that the FED is using outdated data to make decisions today. Is he right or wrong, well, it's difficult to prove as there's no such data publicly available.

**The impact:** I do believe that this was responsible for roughly 30% of the decline of the share price, but it was pretty much normalizing back from an artificially inflated level. However, this is already embedded in the share price today. If Elon is right and we are in deflation, the FED will decrease rates which will push the share price up in the future.

**Reason #4: Interest rate impact on Tesla's business**

If you buy a car or a house and you pay for it in case, well, it doesn't matter whether the interest rate is 0% or 10%, you're not getting any loan. However, the majority of such purchases are made using a loan.

If we take a look at the total cost paid by the buyer, it is equal to the cost of the car (What Tesla is being paid) + the cost of debt (in the form of interest). Hence, even if Tesla keeps the prices exactly the same, the cost from a buyer's perspective increases when interest rates go up.

So, what can Tesla do? There are 2 options:

1. Keep prices the same - This will lead to lower volume sold, but profitability (on a unit level) remains the same.
2. Lower the price - This will lead to higher volume, but lower profitability (on a unit level)

Based on the conversation in Twitter Spaces, it seems as if Tesla it is more likely to go for the second option and focus on selling more cars.

**The impact:** In the short run, it might seem like a bad decision, but I do believe it is the right decision in the long run. They'll be able to expose more customers to their products and increase market share. There's no car company that is better positioned to make a decision such as this one.

**Reason #5: It was overvalued in the first place**

None of the reasons above and all of them combined, do not justify the 69% price drop. There were many Tesla bears shouting that the stock was overvalued above $200, let alone at $400/share. I've valued Tesla multiple times in the last few years and I got to the same conclusion over and over again. I couldn't justify the high price based on the fundamentals.

**So, why am I buying?**

Based on my assumptions, Tesla is fairly valued at around $600b (roughly $190/share). That's why in November I opened a Tesla position and increased it during December. None of the reasons above have a significant negative forward-looking impact.

The market tends to have short-term memory. The focus is on the 69% YTD decline, however, it's still up almost 500% in the last 5 years!

The sentiment has shifted significantly, from everything going right for Tesla, optimism about AI day, Optimus leading to wishful thinking, to more realistic thinking, and now more recently, panic selling.

Could I be wrong? Absolutely! This is just my take.

bonds,I-bonds: Don't forget your 2022 purchase / An additional 5K through your tax refund,"Each social security number can purchase (including receiving as a gift) 10K of I-bonds per year. I see them as alternatives to very long-term CD's and treasury bills, rather than investments you intend to only hold for a year or so, since the holding period is preferred to be five years.

You can also increase the I-bond maximum up to 5K per \*tax filing\* by using up to 5K of your income tax for I-bonds, so can make, for example, an Estimated Tax payment (with voucher 4). Yes, that means if you're joint-filing, that comes to $2.5K per filer, while a single-filer would have 5K. You also get the I-bond in \*paper\* form, and only after the tax filing is processed. See the IRS link.

Search on I-Bonds (and ""Form 8888"", which is the federal tax form you use to allocate your refund) for more information. Do more searching if you want to find ways to gift an I-bond, as well as purchase more (eg. through your LLC, iirc).

personalfinance,Make quarterly tax payments? Raised SSA and interest income,"Asking for my mom, who lives in NJ (which has a state income tax); single filing (she is widowed).

- My dad’s passing 2 years ago left her some funds that she has now in taxable accounts (savings/CDs), and in 2023 interest rates are high, so we estimate she’d have $18-19k in interest income. Banks don’t do state/federal withholding for normal interest (unless there is a way to ask for that)

My questions are:
- would it be advisable to make quarterly federal and state tax payments, and if so, is it needed to pay every quarter (the interest income is end of year only)

So instead of getting caught up in all the bullshit, I like to step away and live my life, free of most of the crap that gets flung around in both sub-Reddit communities. There is so much garbage, and so much fun stuff to read, but it takes a toll on me after awhile, so with that, I bid you all a very fond farewell, but before I go forward on my journey to free my mind of all this, I will leave you with a few of my predictions as promised:

* I do believe Crypto D ot Company and Binance will fail. There are way too many similarities to FTX for them not to follow in its footsteps. They have their own coins, they are both out in some shady country, unregulated, and the people in charge are the epitome of shady. I think the former will fall on its own just due to the over extended bear market, and having no more money to take from customers to keep their operating expenses paid. The latter I believe will fail for the same reasons, but I also think the powers that be, and regulators will go after it, plus the Madoff clawback for the 2 billion dollars Binance got for the buyout of FTX by Sam Bankman-Fried will be successful.

* I think after they both collapse, Bitcoin will trade in a range of $6,000 to $10,000 until the next bull market, which will be triggered by the successful regulation of cryptocurrency after the fallout of the previously mentioned exchanges, and the biggest winner of this regulation will be Coinbase, since it is the only exchange who has been doing everything to appease the most powerful people in the world. The sad part about this is that Coinbase will be absolutely no different than any other regulated exchange at this point, and other big exchanges that already exist such as E*Trade will eat into much of their space now that the stuff is legal and safe… so Coinbase will no longer be unique or frankly even relevant compared to the big boys of Wall Street.

personalfinance,Questions on setting up Solo 401K,"I am 55. Earlier this year, I sold most of the assets of my very small S corporation, and my 3 employees took positions w/ the assets' buyer, leaving me as the only employee of my business. I changed the nature of the existing business into home consulting work and writing etc. rather than through a storefront. I did NOT have a 401K set up for any employees or myself.

I am trying to figure out setting up a solo 401K for myself now I am able to. I would like to make it for 2022, after I went to just myself. I have some questions that were not able to be answered satisfactorily/consistently by several tax professionals I’ve consulted, misc. website references, Fidelity agents, or by the IRS website. Historically I’ve run payroll myself through QuickBooks and did my own business bookkeeping (leaving Federal tax prep to a pro but the pro doesn’t really work much with solo 401k plans so he can’t help me).

1. I understand that since I had employees through April 2022, I can effect my solo plan on a date after that and still have it start in 2022. I just wanted to confirm that there won’t be confusion because of the 2022 W2’s I generate? 
2. I understand I can include in what I defer, the salary I received earlier in the year before the employees left, correct? Or, do I have to disregard my salary, for deferment purposes, earlier on in the year before I went 'solo'?
3. I do still have a 1099 consultant. Is this considered an employee as regards to jeopardizing the solo 401K?
4. My annual W2 salary had been slightly less than the minimum contribution at that point, can I give myself a 2022 raise to cover the amount of the maximum contribution including the catchup after 50 part? I thought I found somewhere in the IRS documents that my tax deferment amount is limited by the average of the last 3 years' compensation (up to the limit)… but unclear if the comments were referring to the solo401K or some other deferment type so I wanted to confirm.
5. I have seen several %’s floating around of what my corporation can contribute ’non-electively' —  20% of my contribution as per the IRS directions I think? I see 25%  elsewhere on solo 401K employer contributions so I wanted to be correct.
6. Need a little help in defining “total compensation” on the amount that can be tax deferred… is this the value of the W2 salary before deductions (up to the limit)? Or what is left on the paycheck after all deductions are removed? Example: $20K is salary, $18K is net paycheck total is after withholding, medicare/FICA removed. Is the tax-deferred limit $20K or $18K? If it's based on the gross salary before the deductions, I will have a follow-up question on this from an IRS941 form perspective on Quickbooks.
7. On the application form, there is an option to sync this with social security or not. Most people chose ‘or not’ according to the Fidelity agent and he told me it would be up to a tax advisor’s choice. Do you know reasons off the top of your head why it would be advantageous and what it means?

I have about 20k in the bank right now. My plan is to take a chunk of this out (probably 8k?) and create an emergency fund account. The rest I want to go to saving a house. I have a car currently that is paid off and only has 50k miles on it, so it'll be around for a while. 

Here is a plan I've drawn up on how to allocate my **monthly** earnings. Should I look at all into investing in the S&amp;P 500? I've heard good things about that, but I don't want to jump into anything like that without better knowledge. Please critique what I have drawn here. 

Essential expenses (50%): Rent, Electricity, Phone, Internet, Insurance, Gym. All of this adds up to roughly $1950. Most of my insurance is provided through work; however, I pay for auto, renters, and liability insurance. 

Retirement Savings (15%): Increase 401k contribution and open Roth IRA such that 15% of my income is being fed to these savings accounts. 

House fund (%10): Emergency fund is already fulfilled at 8k (should I keep feeding into this? how do you recommend I proceed with funding both my house savings and emergyency fund?) so contribute 10% to my house fund. Renting blows. 

Whatever else (%25): Food, gas, entertainment, and whatever else. 

Thank you all in advance for your help and discussion. Please feel free to give any advice or critique on how I should be saving/investing/budgeting. I've been working for about 3 months but I'm tired of just ""winging it"" when it comes to money. And most importantly, I want to retire successfully.",finance,1672031446

personalfinance,Loan Payments Advice,I currently have two major loans pulled out. One is my student loans which have had the interest frozen until September 2023 with a balance of $15k remaining. I graduated last year with a balance of $28k and have been making large payments to knock it down since I thought the interest would unfreeze which was at 6.9% for the highest one in the group of loans which is now gone. Now the highest interest rate in my group of student loans is 4.45% when they unfreeze. My other loan was a personal loan for $25k that I pulled out because I was moving for work out of college and needed money for expenses. I also used this loan to take over the 4.9% interest rate on the $15k I still owed on my car. This loan has an interest rate of 2.99% and is currently at $20k after making the planned monthly payments on it of $400. My question is if I should continue to knock down these loans like this or if I should more aggressively pay off the loan that currently has a higher interest rate? Right now I was planning on continuing to pay off the rest of my student loans by putting $1k a month toward them and continue to make the planned payments toward my personal loan. For reference I make about $80k a year and have about $2k of expenses a month before my loans. Thanks for the advice!,finance,1672033149
hardware,"A thought experiment: How would you go about designing a CPU using a new material that clocks much higher than silicon transistors for the same power usage, but has mid-1990's transistor sizes?","I earlier made a post about this, but I would like to hear what others have to say.

As of right now, the main way of getting more performance is to utilize more and more transistors while keeping clock rates relatively steady. Yes, CPUs are hitting 5-6 GHz and GPUs also pushing upward, but there's a very good reason why Intel's previous goal of ""10 GHz by 2010"" died when they killed Netburst-based Tejas and Jayhawk in favor of Core 2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tejas_and_Jayhawk

&gt; Tejas was slated to operate at frequencies of 7 GHz[1] or higher. However, it's likely that Tejas wouldn't have had linear performance scaling, as it would on average have executed fewer instructions per clock cycle due to more pipeline bubbles from branch mispredicts and data cache misses. Also, it would have run hotter as well with a TDP much higher than the Prescott core of Pentium 4. The CPU was cancelled late in its development after it had reached its tapeout phase.[3]

What if there was a new material that flips that around? Now to extract the highest possible clock rate (and thus performance) out of the new material, it needs to be kept about the same size as regular CPUs or smaller, which also means a very tight transistor budget with the larger transistors. The bigger the architecture design, the longer the critical path and thus the lower the clock rate, unless there are development of tools and testing processes for asynchronous chip designs that are not affected by the pesky critical path problem by having all of the components run at different clock rates.

(Speaking of asynchronous chip designs, Intel had considered it, but despite its advantages, scrapped those plans): https://web.archive.org/web/20060107061334/http://www1.cs.columbia.edu/async/misc/technologyreview_oct_01_2001.html

&gt; Why, for example, did Intel scrap its asynchronous chip? The answer is that although the chip ran three times as fast and used half the electrical power as clocked counterparts, that wasn't enough of an improvement to justify a shift to a radical technology. An asynchronous chip in the lab might be years ahead of any synchronous design, but the design, testing and manufacturing systems that support conventional microprocessor production still have about a 20-year head start on anything that supports asynchronous production. Anyone planning to develop a clockless chip will need to find a way to short-circuit that lead.

&gt; ""If you get three times the power going with an asynchronous design, but it takes you five times as long to get to the market—well, you lose,"" says Intel senior scientist Ken Stevens, who worked on the 1997 asynchronous project. ""It's not enough to be a visionary, or to say how great this technology is. It all comes back to whether you can make it fast enough, and cheaply enough, and whether you can keep doing it year after year."" 

If Intel and/or AMD decide to have a go at using the new material, how would they utilize them?

- Spin up their old Pentium Pro and K5 archs with some tweaks to make them run way beyond their original 150-200 MHz and 75-133 MHz clock rates? The Pentium Pro used 5.5 million transistors and K5 used 4.3 million transistors, in comparison to Zen 4 CCD using 6.57 billion transistors (I couldn't find Raptor Lake's transistor count numbers).

- What instruction sets would be dropped or emulated to reduce the amount of needed transistors, which would cause headaches for developers that were just getting around to using instruction sets such as AVX-2 and AVX-512?

- If they decide to only have small portion of their CPU utilize it (e.g. AMD using a chiplet of it alongside with traditional silicon chiplets), what would that small portion of super clocked but low density transistors be doing? Intel's asynchronous CPU design might be helpful here as they can design a specialty CPU core that tears through specific workloads, but they would need to find a way to glue that different die to the rest of the CPU die.

- The CPU cache question of how to keep the new CPU constantly fed with data? If the new CPU is running at 10-50 GHz or something crazy along those lines, any cache miss will amplify the wasted CPU cycles of waiting for the data to be fetched. Absolute RIP if the CPU has to wait for data from the RAM. And let's not discuss the performance hit from waiting on CXL, Optane or SSD storage. Or god forbid a 5400 RPM HDD because an OEM decided it would be funny to use spinny disks as the OS boot drive for computers with the speedy CPU.

- Speaking of the RAM, printing that on a variation of the new material (assuming it could be done) to have RAM that could keep pace with the speedy CPU would bring DRAM capacities of 32-128 GB back to the mid-1990's 64-256 MB range. And that's not including the issue of designing the motherboard tracing to maintain signal integrity. Dell is trying to replace SODIMM with CAMM to greatly shorten the tracing between the RAM and CPU so that the DDR5 sticks can run much faster.

- But making the CPU cache larger would massively drive up the costs and size of the CPU. And it would also increase the latency of fetching data from them. Maybe use a L4 cache using traditional silicon SRAM so that the CPU is less likely to reach out to the RAM?

- Better memory fetching prediction would be helpful in pulling data to the caches before they're needed, but it has to use minimal transistors and be as fast as the CPU core.

- If manufacturing DRAM with that material is feasible, it would be interesting to see it compared against SRAM. SRAM is normally faster than DRAM and has far less storage density. Where would that ""mid-1990's DRAM capacity except it's running 10x higher clock rate than DDR5"" fit between those two memory options?

Yeah I know it's a lot of ""what ifs"" for a non-existent material, but I thought it would be a fun, nerdy thought exercise.",technology,1672036323

stocks,Disney(DIS) DCF analysis need advice and criticisms,"# INTRODUCTION:

DIS has 2 main revenue sources, Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).

**DMED** includes things like their Linear Network (Disney Channel, ESPN etc.) and Direct to Consumer(DTC) products like Disney+ and Hulu.**DPEP** includes things like their Theme Parks, Merchandising and Intellectual Property Licensing.

As per 2021's 10-K DMED takes up about 75% of revenue while DPEP takes up the remaining 25%.

# REVENUE(DMED):

I forecast that DMED will continue taking the bulk of revenue based on Management's guidance from the 2021 Q4 earnings call. “We don't expect to see a substantial recovery in international attendance at our domestic parks until towards the end of fiscal 2022.” So because DPEP will only recover to a limited extent DMED will continue to grow faster than DPEP and continue occupying the majority of revenue.

DMED's revenue driver with the largest growth prospect seems to come from their DTC products especially Disney+ with Linear Network seeming to be a matured business. However, based on management's guidance ""reaching between 230 and 260 million paid Disney+ subscribers globally by the end of fiscal year 2024, and with Disney+ achieving profitability that same year.” I'd assume that in the best case scenario Disney+ does not raise prices to continue attracting subscribers. So Y/Y growth is likely to be limited as Disney+ as of 2021 was only at about 118 million halfway of the forecasted subscribers needed by 2024.

# Revenue(DPEP):

I forecast that DPEP should brighten up over time as covid-19 restrictions get lifted and they return back to full operational capability without any covid-19 restrictions. China's zero covid policy does have a negative impact on Shanghai Disneyland, however this impact on overall DPEP's revenue is limited as most of DPEP's revenue comes from the US.

Not much guidance was given for merchandising, but Walt Disney has always been a strong licensor of their IPs so it's safe to assume that merchandising is mostly unaffected.

# EBIT:

DIS is expected to have higher operating expense in order to meet their subscriber goal by 2024. Things such as higher production cost as DIS has released 37 movies in 2022 compared to 21 in 2021. And higher advertising cost,  advertising cost was increased by 17% in 2021 from 2020 mainly to advertise DIS DTC.

There is also expected to be higher labor cost to run Disneyland as covid restrictions get lifted. Seeing how DIS is perceived as a luxury good. With their competitor's Six Flags cheapest tickets being at $25 while DIS is at about $80. In this tougher inflationary environment, consumers are likely to be less willing to spend more on luxury good so revenue from DPEP is likely to take a hit and DIS does incur high fixed cost such as maintenance cost.

So overall, EBIT is likely to at the best case scenario maintain at 9% from last year's margin.

# OVERALL:

Y/Y revenue growth for 2022 I'd assume it's going to increase from 3.10% in 2021 to about 5.75% in 2022. Revenue growth is likely to be driven mainly by higher subscribers but other than that, I'd expect not much growth.

For 2023-2025, under the assumption that the FED's interest path and goals are met it should be cheaper for DIS to utilise leverage to reinvest back into the firm and grow Disney+. However I'm conservative in expecting too much out of Disney+ as NFLX will be releasing ad supported plans by November 2022 but revenue growth should still be strong regardless. I forecast about 7.1% of Y/Y revenue for 2023 and 2024.

For 2025, once interest rates are substantially lowered it should be significantly cheaper for DIS to reinvest back into the firm and ramp up production. As DIS relies on ""telling the world’s most original and enduring stories. Second, maximizing the synergy of our unique eco-system to deepen consumers’ connection to our characters and stories.” to maximize their revenue. The growing subscriber base for Disney+ and the higher production should increase the appeal of the disney brand, increasing both DPEP and DMED.

EBIT is likely to increase overtime as DIS gains more internal economies of scales from ramping up production for DTC products and overall improve efficiency as DIS seems to not be very efficiently run with margins being at 9% for 2021 compared to 17% for 2019 precovid.

# ASSUMPTION:

1. Taxes are assumed to be at 30% of EBIT throughout my forecast period, this amount may be very high but DIS taxes have always been weird. As seen from here: [https://imgur.com/a/BW4428X](https://imgur.com/a/BW4428X)
2. D&amp;A is more stable so I assumed it to be at constant 7% of revenue throughout my forecast period.
3. Deferred Taxes is assumed to be at constant 2% of EBIT. Deferred taxes have also always been weird my guess is because DIS changed how they recognized revenue a while ago so there isn't consistency in this. As seen from here: [https://imgur.com/a/lRkmQ2a](https://imgur.com/a/lRkmQ2a)
4. Change in NWC is assumed to be constant at 1.5% of revenue. There was a trend of about 1%-3% of change in NWC for DIS so I took the middle ground.
5. CapEx is assumed to be 8% for 2022 and 2023 as DIS ramps up R&amp;D to efficiently run Disney+ but drops back down to 7% in 2024 and 6% in 2025.
6. WACC and TGR are 8.2% and 3% respectively.

# CONCLUSION:

Overall, my stock price for DIS is $78.68 which seems that current prices are way too expensive to jump in on DIS.

Areas of weakness I can identify for my DCF would be that I'm very uncertain of how Linear Network(DMED) and Merchandising(DPEP) are currently affected by current environment. WACC was also quite uncertain for me when I tried calculating it.

I'd love to hear some feedback or criticism for my thought processes and if I'm being too bearish on DIS.

There are things I would have done much differently up until now had I better informed myself, but I can only ensure I make the right moves going forward.

37/M: Income is $150k/yr
Spouse income is $80k/yr

• $140k in traditional IRA
• $50k HYSA currently 3.75% 
• $180k HYSA currently 3.3%
• $15k in 401k at current employer
• $6.5k in Roth IRA
• $6.5k in Spouse Roth IRA
• Spouse Pension, will equate to roughly $60k/yr after retirement
 • Social Security, not relying on this but if there’s anything left by the time I retire, would be about $32k/yr.

I work in tech so typically changing jobs every few years. The traditional IRA is a result of compounding multiple 401ks from previous roles.

Our only debt currently is $160k left on mortgage, more than half paid off (7 years into 30 year at 3.99%). 

Our income level prevents write off for traditional IRA contributions. I had opened the Roth IRAs to start building those up, but I’d ideally like to compound things as much as possible.

In 2023, I’m planning to:

• Roll all cash to the HYSA with the higher interest rate.
• Contribute the 401k max at $22.5k
• Contribute the max $6.5k to IRAs
• Putting about $3-5k per month to HYSA

We are now at the income limit for Roth, so not sure what the best course of action is. 

Should I close out the traditional IRA and take the 10% hit?

Should I use the back door method to continue funding the two Roth accounts? 

Should I do something else with our sizable savings? I am generally pretty risk adverse and with interest on savings this good, it’s hard to pass up a guaranteed return vs further general investing to current volatility. I know rates likely won’t be like this for long.

personalfinance,"Is it better to buy a house now and tolerate the higher interest rate until we refinance, or spend another $29k per year on rent in the hope that house-prices drop?","I'm experiencing some frustrating decision-fatigue and would appreciate some opinions. We've been looking at houses to buy but of course the repayments are a lot higher than our rent. We're also in our late-30's so feel pressured to buy a house soon so that we're not in our late-60's and making mortgage payments, and so that we don't continue to throw money away on rent when we have the finances to buy. Conscious of the current house prices being over-priced in our area, but right now they aren't receiving multiple offers and competing with other offers, which they were 3 months ago.

I wont list all the varying options our mortgage advisor has suggested, but basically, the mortgage payment with all extra costs included works out to roughly **$4,400 - $4,500** per month. This is terrifying to me as we're only paying $2,400 in rent, but as I said, I feel that we need to actually get started on the property ladder and start investing in a property.

Here is our current financial situation for a family of 4. We have 2 kids with 1 in daycare which adds an extra $1300 per month but that cost will end in June 2023.

**Income:** $12,000 per month (after tax, contributions, medical, etc, and excludes bonuses, shares and pending promotions)

**Living costs with rent:** $6,000 per month (this includes the daycare fees which will end in June)

**Living costs with mortgage** (excluding any maintenance repairs upgrades): $6,750

**Debts:** Car lease with $8,500 remaining ($360 per month)

**Savings:** $40,000 (doesn't include bonuses, vested shares, or pay-rises).

With an FHA we will only have to put down 3.5% meaning our emergency fund will remain in tact. We thought about renting and continuing to save for the 20% downpayment, but removing the mortgage insurance will only save $360 per month (which I know we will be throwing away but it still feels safer than putting down $120k in savings if/when we can save that amount).

Increasing our rent payment to a mortgage payment (an extra $2,100 per month) is terrifying to me. I'm not sure if rates will drop over the next year or 2, or even if the rates dropping would reduce the payment significantly anyway. We will get the $1,300 back when our kid begins school, but honestly, I bet that will get eaten up on other things like house repairs, kids activities, etc.

Would love your opinions on if I'm being over-cautious, or if now is just a terrible time to buy and if we should just wait out the year and re-assess (whilst eating the rent costs).

Many thanks in advance!

&amp;#x200B;

**EDIT: Really appreciate everyone's thoughts on this post. I think the plan is to wait until we have a bigger downpayment, our living costs are reduced (daycare fees stop), we get our promotions/pay-rises/bonuses, and to see if house prices drop over the next year so we can get down to a 30% income budget for house costs.

personalfinance,First car buying myself: Need help deciding how to finance a car and any advice. Thank you.,"My credit is not great: 639
I only have $2000 to put as a down payment and no co-signer.
Houston, TX area

Cars I have in mind: Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata, Hyundai Tucson, Toyota Camry

I work and go to school from home. But sometimes my family takes road trips and I have errands to run in my area/city. Our family car that I share/use is on its last leg.

I’m debating going to a dealership for a 2021-2022; either financing through the dealership or through my credit union. I haven’t applied for either yet, but I read for newer cars, the interest rate would be lower.

On the other hand, I’m considering going through an in-house financing at a used car dealership, just because I would prefer my credit not be ran. 

The only reason I am saying this is because I already have a personal loan I took out a couple years ago, and I plan on acquiring my first investment property this year so I don’t want too many things on my credit when I apply for the house loan. 

I would like to get it before the year ends since I read right now is the best time to buy a car (end of quarter/year), but I’m so lost on what car and how to go about it. If you believe I should wait, please tell me too. 

Does anyone have advice on how I should go about getting this car? Also, the type of insurance I should get (full coverage, gap, etc.)? Is there an insurance in case the car gets stolen (Hyundai trend)? Or direct me to a subreddit to help? Thank you again.",finance,1672098087
personalfinance,Am I on the Right Track? Advice + Input Welcome,"Hi fellow Redditors,

I'm seeking some extra set of eyes to offer wisdom and insight for my current personal finance structure and future goals.

Background- I (26F) am single first-gen. I was fortunate enough to graduate with a bachelors and two masters degrees. My parents are minimum wage workers and did their best to help me through school while supporting my much younger siblings still at home. They helped with some room and board costs but I took student loans for all 3 of my degrees. I graduated with $90k in student loans and my career has a high earning potential, I'm currently earning $90k. i'd consider leaving my role in the next 12-16 months for a role earning $130k+. I rent an apartment in the downtown area of a HCOL city with a roommate. I began learning about the FIRE/FI strategies when I finished my masters degree. Since then, I have tackled some “low-hanging fruit” strategies with a limited starting income 2020- (40k) 2021 -(70k). I am contributing my 401k to employer match, I got a side hustle teaching group fitness classes, saved a 10k emergency fund, and have been paying extra on the principal of my car loan since purchasing it 2.5 years ago.

Here is a breakdown of my 2023 monthly budget &amp; net worth.

W9 Gross Monthly Income: $7,500

W9 401k: Max Contribution

W9 Net Monthly Income: $4,700

Monthly Side Hustle Income (varies): $200

**Monthly Expenses:**

Rent: $1600

Car Payment: $400

Subscriptions: $70

Car Expenses- Maintenance/Gas/Parking/Uber: $130

**Monthly Financial Goals Contribution:**

**Liabilities**

Credit Card Debt: $0

Federal Student Loans: $90,000  (currently qualify for PSLF if I stay in not-for-profit for another 7 years. My income earning potential would be higher outside NFP)

Car Loan Balance: $8500

As you can imagine, my parents don't have a strong financial footing considering their incomes despite both working two jobs. They have been renting for the last 25 years. I wasn't a recipient of generation wealth or financial literacy so i’m making it my goal to focus on financial literacy and personal development in 2023. Currently reading Atomic Habits and The 12-week Year. Moving on to finance books (I Will Teach You To Be Rich) following that. I would love recommendations from books that helped you starting out.

You may be alarmed by my hobbies budget. I am learning new skills and exploring new hobbies as an adult that my parents didn’t have the disposable income to provide in my childhood. (Learning instruments and sports etc.) I’ve found it enriching and I make learning and growth a priority for my well-being.

Am I on the right track for my age and income? Would you recommend any changes to my budget? My first short-term goal is to save/invest $100k by 28 years old. Does purchasing a condo/townhouse make financial sense for me in the next 24 months? A safe and well maintained condo would be about 325-400k in my city.

I have been following this sub and have been inspired by those who showed discipline, sacrifice and hard work to earn their financial independence. I want to be a success story and I’m willing to work for it. I especially know that time is on my side at 26 y/o and I want to take full advantage of that.

I would be grateful for any advice/words of encouragement you can offer. Thank you in advance for your help.",finance,1672103771

[Full Article](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/the-stock-market-s-next-bull-run-won-t-kick-off-until-these-2-things-occur/ar-AA15FqPW?cvid=dc47b770877c448fafa3fd7f68503c2a)

Investors shouldn't expect a bull market to return for stocks until volatility declines, according to a Thursday note from DataTrek Research.

Unfortunately, investors shouldn't expect volatility to decline until two things happen: The Federal Reserve stops hiking interest rates, and there's more clarity on corporate earnings expectations heading into a potential recession next year.

If investors can properly gauge those two factors, and ultimately anticipate the transition from a high volatility regime to a low volatility one, then they can capitalize off extreme stock market returns.

Prior examples of market transitions include the S&amp;P 500's 28% surge in 2003 after the dot-com bubble, the 26% gain in 2009 after the Great Financial Crisis, and the 61% gain from the COVID-19 low through the end of 2020.

""For volatility to structurally decline and drive those high returns, investors need to have growing confidence they know how corporate earnings will develop. This means they mush have a handle on monetary/fiscal policy,"" DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas said.

And right now, investors are unsure about both factors. The Fed caught the market by surprise last week when it indicated that it will likely raise interest rates by another 75 basis points in 2023 and leave rates higher for longer. And the Fed's timeline could change on a dime if inflation remains persistently high.",finance,1672107273

With that being said, I've been sitting on the money for a while. I used roughly $30K of it to purchase a great house with a low interest rate and my wife and I currently live in it. This house has the potential and space to be our end all be all house. 

The wife and I both work, currently bringing in roughly $230K combined. We own our car, have no outstanding debts (except for CC debt paid off in full every month). We're comfortable enough to where I can pay the mortgage and all bills with my paycheck, and her's goes towards our savings. 

We've recently been discussing having kids and what to do with the remaining gift money. My father worked himself to the bone till he was 60 and I saw the toll it took on him.

personalfinance,Opinion on buying high dividend ETFs,"Hello all,

I am currently considering taking some of the money out of my bank fund (low interest rates, poor capital availabilit but also low risk) and investing it additionally to my current portfolio:

Currently I am investing:
70% Vanguard Developed World
15% Vanguard Emerging Markets
15% S&amp;P 500 (to be able to overweight USA cheaply)

Now I am thinking about taking out a part of the bank fund (maybe 10k) to invest it in a dividend payer. My thinking is that these are less volatile and replicate my bank fund in terms of risk, but pay significantly more dividends and are cheaper/better available to sell.

investing,"Sagax AB class A, B and C shares and dividends?","So I was running some stock screeners and stumbled into this Swedish real-estate company with three different classes of shares. The only meaningful difference for me as individual investor between class A and B shares seems to be that my broker accepts 70% of the value of class B shares as collateral for investing loans, and only 50% for class A. But then there's also class D. From their website:

""Class A and B common shares are entitled to the same dividend per share. Class D common shares are entitled to five (5) times the total dividend on Class A and B common shares, but no more than two (2) SEK per share and year.""

link: [https://www.sagax.se/financial-information/shares/dividend](https://www.sagax.se/financial-information/shares/dividend)

Right now class A and B pay 2,15 SEK/year in dividends, and they are trading at approx. nine times the price of class D shares (238,6 vs 26,4 SEK). I'm a little bit confused about this, but I assume that anyone who believes the company will keep growing and increasing their dividend would buy class A or B. But the existence of class D shares makes me uneasy. If I were to buy 100 shares of class B, my yearly dividend would be 215 SEK (0,89%). Someone who invests a similar sum into class D would get around 900 shares, and thus a yearly dividend of \~1800 SEK (7,37%).

There's approximately 26 million class A, 293 mil class B and 126 mil class D shares outstanding. Quick calculation (might be wrong) and the current valuation of class D shares is \~4% of the total company value, but shareholders of class D get paid \~27% of the total yearly dividend.

The company sits on my watchlist, but somehow this dividend mess makes me hesitant to even seriously consider buying any shares. Even if we assume that the company grows like crazy and eventually that 2 SEK/class D share is going to be insignificant and completely dwarfed by class A and B, it would get there faster if it was not bleeding as much money on dividends on junk shares.

Any thought on this? Have I understood this completely wrong? If you thought this company as a potential long-term play, how would you feel about the dividend policy between different share classes?",finance,1672136817

# [Stock futures rise heading into the final trading week of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; U.S. stock futures rose on Tuesday as the final trading days of 2022 kicked off and investors hoped a Santa Claus rally will appear and lift a market that has been weighed down by recession fears.
*****
&gt; Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose by 160 points, or 0.48%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures advanced 0.4% and 0.1%, respectively.
*****
&gt; During the regular session Friday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 176 points higher, or 0.5%. The S&amp;P 500 rose 0.6%, and the Nasdaq Composite added 0.2%.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the start of the time period for a Santa Claus rally, which is typically considered the final five-day trading stretch in the current year, as well as the first two trading days in the new year. Markets were closed Monday for the Christmas holiday.
*****
&gt; Due to low trading volumes, investors are expecting either relative quiet or further volatility during the holiday-shortened week. Markets are closing out a month and year defined by a surge in recession fears.
*****
&gt; In December, the S&amp;P 500 dropped roughly 5.8%, while the Dow and Nasdaq dropped about 4% and 8.5%, respectively. These are the biggest monthly declines since September. The major averages are headed for their worst annual performance since 2008.
*****
&gt; ″[The] question of what kind of recession remains unanswered,” Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist at LPL Financial, wrote Friday. “And for this, the answer is dictated primarily from how much more the Fed needs to raise rates to finally tackle sticky inflation.”
*****
&gt; On the economic front, traders are expecting the latest data on November wholesale inventories and the October S&amp;P/Case-Shiller home prices Tuesday before the bell.

personalfinance,Downsizing to one car to save?,"I was looking for suggestions on how downsizing to one car would help us be able to save more/avoid unnecessary expenses. My SO just recently got a remote job so that’s a big change, and we probably got a pretty bad deal on his vehicle since we desperately needed one because of a previous accident. It’s a Corolla under 5 y/o that we ended up financing for about $18k but it’s only worth about $12k max. We still owe about $16k at this point as we haven’t had it for very long. Our interest rate is the only not totally terrible thing as we got about 5%, so we pay somewhere around $300/mo.

Our car insurance is also a big factor, due to the accident, our rates are super high, about $300/mo for 2 people and both of our cars. If we sell the Corolla, we’d probably end up saving another $100-150/mo. 

The only issue I can think of is that we live in an extremely unwalkable city and you need a car to get literally anywhere, even a corner store or a grocery store. I still work in office so my SO won’t have any access to the vehicle for most of the day. We’ve been without a car for a temporary amount of time due to small things like a flat tire or a car being in the shop for repairs and it was terrible. At that time we both had in person jobs about a 30 minute commute in opposite directions so that was a huge part of it, so I’m sure I’d at least be less of a inconvenience now that one person works from home. 

Overall, I was wondering if it would be worth it to sell the car at a loss to save about $400/mo. It’d definitely be a huge help in bulking up our savings, but keeping the car isn’t hurting our budget either. Had anyone gone though something similar or have any suggestions?",finance,1672157061
personalfinance,Borrowing money from family for house down payment,"My partner and I are looking to buy a house soon.

I'm working on a team of about 10 people to maintain a decent-sized software suite for a few hundred users.  (I feel like we're a little overstaffed and not doing enough, but that's beside my point.)  There is virtually no documentation of anything in the environment, the little documentation that does exist is way out of date. Whenever I ask anyone for information I'll get a different answer from each person; even for something as simple as starting a service, 3 different people will provide 3 different answers and they're often all wrong.  There's no correlated logging and no monitoring of the environment- users complain directly to the ops team if services are down.  It's also extremely difficult to learn what is supposed to be happening because everyone kind of does their own thing, so someone might decide to test out a script and bring down a node, but someone else might notice the node is down and try to bring it back up during this testing thus frustrating both parties and making it hard to determine what is supposed to be happening at any given time.  These problems have all been brought up in team meetings and one-on-ones with managers, but there never seems to be any action taken.

bonds,quantitative easing and tightening (vis-a-vis bonds)?,"i was trying to read up on QE and QT as it relates to the treasury (or the fed?!) but also to try to wrap my head around the mechanics of the bond market.
with binds i have gotten to the point where i understand that in the secondary market the yields (what i am interested in i guess) fall or go lower (bad for me) when demand rises since the price rises which lowers yields (which lowers what i make on it).
also that this demand and the yield are not necessarily tied to the fed benchmark rate(?).
but also i don't quite get how QE and QT work or how the fed (?) effectuates this exactly. also i guess it is kind of like eminent domain in the sense they just take or sell what they want at the price they want?
for instance on the QT page here it says they buy back bonds from commercial entities to ease the amount of money in the market which i don't get.
lastly - well i still don't get how the fed prices the various treasuries when they auction them off. i do get that they call it a ""tail"" when the rate is set lower than what you could have bought it on the secondary market. but i don't white understand how they set it. do they set it with an eye toward QE and QT?",finance,1672164081
bonds,Is anyone else excited / bullish on the prospect of longer dated bonds?,"My thoughts being that US economy goes into recession mode and disinflation or deflation starting next year.  Could be tremendously bullish for longer dated bonds, 10 year for example.  I've been looking at mostly corporate bonds in quality companies that I feel could withstand a recession.  Treasuries could also be a good option.  

The way I see it though, is that bonds have depreciated in the neighborhood of 10-20% over the 2022 calendar year.  I don't see the Fed raising rates significantly more than they already have as recession risk is high, and the market has already priced in additional rate rises.  Some 10 year corporate bonds yield in the 5-7% range.  So, one can collect a 5-7% yield while waiting for benchmark rates to start coming down.  When they do you'll regain that 10-20% capital appreciation that has been lost in this Fed tightening cycle.

Monthly payment currently $2799

Currently I have the capacity to save and pay about $60k over and above the principle each year but I’m wondering if it makes more sense to put that into index funds and wait until the market is closer to a 52 week high and then withdraw and use the money to pay off a nicer chunk of the balance. Wondering if that makes more mathematical sense then making consistent quarterly principle payments of about 15k each. I want to pay off the mortgage as fast as possible but it makes a trivial difference if its over 7 years vs 8 years due to market fluctuations.

Thought process is a loan against my 401k and put towards my mortgage guarantees a 7.25% return on that money. I could loan 25k and pay back at 8.5% interest over 5 years. Would this be a good idea?

* A dear friend of mine is a financial advisor in another state. I'd never used a financial planner type person but this guy helped me review and change some of my investment strategy in 2020 with a plan to check in again in a year or two. He charged me nothing, I trust him 100%, and he has very similar values to mine.
* Then my dad got sick and, now, his mom is terminal and he doesn't have capacity to have conversations about my portfolio as he keeps up with his real clients and her care.
* The combo of not looking things over for two years with the market craziness plus my inheritance is making me have some anxiety.

So, if you have any advice on the below OR think the conversation is worth paying someone to have please weigh in if you're feeling generous! Thank you in advance!

* Am I using the right strategy?
* Are these investments percentages ok? Alarming? Disastrous?
* Should I do something like pay off my house or bet it all on black or anything? There's a lot of money just 'sitting' right now because I'm still too close to my dad's death to make moves but I would like to in the next six months or so.
* Is a gap year feasible? If I didn't do it and just plugged away would it be possible to retire early? How early?

I could absolutely increase that rate if I would do a better job with budgeting/eating at home. At minimum, I would like to align my spending with my values and, if not save that money, then make sure I'm spending it on experiences/travel/self-improvement.

The state has a form -- number IT-2104 -- for State Income Tax Withholding. It's very similar to the federal W4. I'm not sure if anyone else does this, but an accountant mentioned to me, for the W4, a relatively quick and dirty way to fill it out without swinging the pendulum too far in one direction or the other (i.e., owing or getting refunded too much) is to have my wife and I each mark ""Single"" on Step 1 and each account for one child (i.e. each use $2,000) on Step 3. Apparently, even though my wife and I file our taxes jointly, marking the W4 in this way really splits things down the middle without having to use the estimation calculator or do anything more in depth. I'm open to feedback on this, but what I'm really trying to figure out is, if I do proceed with this approach on the federal level, it would seem logical to do something similar on the state level with the IT-2104.

The form is located here: [https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/current\_forms/it/it2104\_fill\_in.pdf](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/current_forms/it/it2104_fill_in.pdf)

What I think would be correct to do is for my wife and I to each mark ""Single"" in the top right, and use ""4"" in Line 1. Line 1 references a worksheet: [https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2023/printable-pdfs/inc/it2104i-2023.pdf](https://www.tax.ny.gov/pdf/2023/printable-pdfs/inc/it2104i-2023.pdf)

I arrived at ""4"" because on Line 19 of the worksheet (Page 5), it asks to add lines 6-18. I would have a ""1"" (for one child) on line 6 and a ""3"" for ""Child and Dependent Care Credit"" on line 10. 1+3 = 4.

Can someone who knows more about this let me know if ""4"" on Line 1 for each of us sounds correct.

Perhaps I should scrap this for both the W4 and the IT-2104? I don't necessarily mind crunching the numbers but what do you use for each form so that you don't over or under withhold?

personalfinance,How to best save for childrens' potential college expenses?,"TL;DR: What's the best way to save, invest, and pay for college expenses without paying penalties but leaving flexibility for my kids if they don't want to go to college?

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to set up my children for better success than I had financially. I have a large student loan balance with a low interest rate that I'm just paying the ""minimum"" payment (it's paying principal, not just interest) until it's gone. I don't want them to have that experience if I can at all help it.

&amp;#x200B;

I currently contribute 5% to my employer's retirement account, TSP (federal employee equivalent to 401K), to get all of their match. Also I net about +$1,500 per year in my HSA which then gets invested. My highest interest debt is my car at 3.99%. There is a little extra at the end of each month that I would like to try and save for my children. I don't have an end number in mind, just whatever is in the account is what's in the account for them. I would advise them to go to a local community college if possible and the then transfer to in-state public school for maximum ""easy"" savings. I was thinking of two possibilities:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Roth IRA

2. Ohio 529 Plan

&amp;#x200B;

The 529 is designed for saving for college education, but my wife made a good point: ""What if they don't want to go to college? It wouldn't be fair to give Jimmy $20,000 for college while Timmy gets nothing."" That's the main reason I'm shy of the 529.

&amp;#x200B;

But then I found out contributions and gains in a Roth IRA can be withdrawn for qualified educational expenses for qualified individuals. Which tuition, board, books, and supplies qualify for. And logically, children are qualified individuals. However, that still leaves the problem of what if they don't go to college? Well, I could take a loan against my TSP equivalent to what they would have received for school and keep the Roth IRA balance for myself instead. And if that makes sense, maybe I should do that for all the kids instead of withdrawing from the Roth IRA?

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I'm not going to give them money so that they can go party somewhere for 6 months instead of going to school. Possible ""payouts"" could be for a down payment on house (whether to live in or as an investment), starting a business, or something else which is impossible without upfront cash. Additionally, I wouldn't tell them about the money until after they've decided their going, or if they express hesitancy based on cost alone. I'm trying to caution them against debt, not scare them from ever going into debt.

&amp;#x200B;

Simply put, how can I put money to work so that when they are legally adults, I can give them an advantage without any penalties.

Should a brand new, first time investor enter today's market via index funds and a Roth IRA?

I'm currently reading The Simple Path to Wealth, and have previously used Dave Ramsey to get myself out of massive student loan and car debt. My personal answer is, yes, absolutely start investing today. Even if that means my initial investments will likely lose money for a while. On the other hand -- being a total beginner -- it's scary to put some hard earned savings into a volatile market for the first time.

I'm not looking to get speculative or invest my money into a single company. I'm looking at parking my cash in VTSAX or other index funds for 15-20 years. With that mindset, today's market and economic recessions mean little for my potential investments, right? ""Shares are on sale"" essentially? If I can stomach watching my savings take a few hits in the immediate, than all should rise again in due time?

Or are there other mitigating factors currently that should stay my hand, and let my savings park in a HYSA for a while until the market begins to recover?

solar,Calculating the solar credit: what's the denominator?,"We're thinking of having solar panels installed on the roof of our home, and we've been talking to a vendor who offers a ""zero cost"" option that relies on our claiming the federal solar energy credit. But I'm having trouble telling if the vendor's tax math checks out.

Basically, the vendor would install a 10,000 watt system on our roof, which the vendor values at $42,000 (based on a quoted market rate of $4.20/watt for installation). In return, we would:

1. Pay $11,600 upfront for the installation; and
2. Assign all SRECs to the vendor, estimated at $36-$48K over the next 15 years.

Based on the above, the vendor says we could claim a $12,600 solar energy credit (i.e., 30% of the $42,000 ""system value"") on our next return. If that's correct, our credit would exceed our out-of-pocket costs by $1,000 ($12,600 vs. $11,600).

But I can't tell whether the vendor is using the right denominator. [Form 5695](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i5695) talks about ""qualified solar electric property costs"" (not ""system value""), and the instructions say that we should ""Enter the amounts \[we\] paid for qualified solar electric property."" That makes it sound like we would have to use our out-of-pocket costs ($11,600) as the denominator, which would yield a much smaller credit ($3,480).

Am I misunderstanding? Does assigning the SRECs to the vendor count as an additional ""qualified solar electric property cost""? Or are we limited to using out-of-pocket costs to calculate the credit?

High credit scores, higher limits on credit cards vs total credit card (i.e. plenty of available credit), total balances of delinquencies rates which remain as low as they've been since the 90s, HELOCs were taken very low so homeowners have lots of equity, transition to delinquency remains at low levels going back to the 90s, and all categories (like mortgage deliquencies) remain below pre COVID levels (except HELOCs).

We can see the current supply remains far below that.

Conclusion:

My opinion is still the same.

Inflation will prove stickier. Housing will remain high. People who build homes turned that off, existing home listings remain way down, the supply to the market is low. People do not have to sell their house because they are employed, gaining income, and have savings. Household debt is in fantastic shape and consumers can easily withstand increases in it. The labor market continues to favor employees to switch jobs, demand better wages.

Therefor, the Fed will keep rates higher until it causes the labor market, consumer spending, housing, to turn appreciably negative (shallow recession). It won't cut the rate unless the recession turns ugly. The stock market will grind lower.

Black Swan:

China COVID. Who knows how the supply chain gets disrupted, the level of global infections could be higher than ever seen, it could spawn a new variant that is more deadly, more contagious, evades prior antibodies better. If that caused a pull back, leading to recession, inflation will come down, Fed could pivot.",finance,1672176504

personalfinance,Best way to pay down CC debt with lump sum,"Hello, 
I have some extra money after the holidays that I’d like to apply towards a few high interest credit cards. Traditional advice is to pay down the smallest balances first, but with a lump sum, does it make more sense to pay down the bigger balance? I have 4 open cards:

Card A (29.2%)      $348

Card B (32.24%)    $1837

Card C (29.9%)      $222

Card D (28.99%)    $738

Total = $3145

I have about $1500-2000 that I can pay right now. How should I apply these funds? My goal is to improve my credit score even if I pay a little bit more in the long run, as I’m looking to buy a car this summer and want to be able to get the best possible interest rate. My current score is about 620. Also, I know these rates are horrible. I’m in a rebuilding period… I went from making ~30k per year to over 120k in 2022.

bonds,Inputs on Bond Pricing Formulas,"I'm trying to understand the bond pricing models by going through the formulas in the Fabozzi book, this is the same formula from other guides, where the Price = PV of coupon stream + PV of the end lump.  


It looks like there are two interest rates in the formula - one having to do with the coupon rate, and the other having to do with ""target yield"".

I met a friend who said that at some time he opened different joint accounts where he was a secondary co-owner and started submitting close to 10K in each account. He did this because he wanted to deposit his hard earned cash to the bank so he could start making investments.

investing,Stay the course on bond fund or get out and invest in bonds/CDs directly for 2023?,"I have $200K invested in a short term bond fund in a taxable account.  The fund has lost 6% approximately in the last year.  

I am wondering whether I should hold and wait for recovery or sell, recognize the capital gains loss and reinvest in t-notes or CDs (up to 1 year) which are currently paying 4.5%+.

I guess my question is whether the bond fund has a chance to out perform current bond/CD rates over 2023, assuming the Fed keeps raising rates though Q2 2023 and then rates remain stable.  

Will the bond fund recover sufficient value in that environment? Looking into the fund, the top 10 holdings are T-notes with yields in the range of 0.75% to 1%.  It feels like dumping a basket of low yield bonds and starting fresh with investments that pay 4.5% is the better bet but I don't really understand how the value of bonds currently held in the fund are likely to recover as interest rates stabilize??

stocks,What have central bankers learnt from the last decade of zero-percent rates?,"I've been thinking quite a bit about the BoJ's decision to widen their target yield band this past week. After the hawkish comments from the ECB and then the move last week from the BoJ it seems a lot of market commenters are of the opinion that what we're seeing is a permanent departure from the zero and negative interest rate ""experiments"" central bankers have pursued over the last decade.

For example, I watched a CNBC clip recently which first acknowledged that Japan had a deflationary problem in recent years which the BoJ had been fighting with very supportive monetary policy, but then went on to call the BoJ policy of negative rates and yield control crazy - implying that there was a more rational course of action they should have been taking.

And it's not just in regards to the BoJ policy, I'm also hearing similar things about the Fed too. But what I'm yet to see is a better alternative to the extremely low interest rates we have seen over the last decade. It seems to me that the only option central bankers had was to accept below target inflation (or outright deflation in Japan's case), or attempt to stimulate the economy with extremely supportive monetary policy. Neither of which are good.

Given that we don't seem to have any better answers it seems to me that it's likely that in a couple of years when this inflationary wave has past and Japan's demographic situation continues to deteriorate that the BoJ will probably need to continue to aggressively stimulate the economy. And I think the same is very likely to be true in Europe and US, although to a lesser extent due to slightly better demographics.

I guess I'm just wonder if I'm missing something here? If central bankers are to take a different stance to monetary policy this decade, can someone help me understand what that would be? If zero percent interest rates were a mistake, what was the right policy? And is there any good reason to think these hawkish moves are likely to persist?",finance,1672194231

stocks,"It's great watching the market go higher, but you make more if it goes down big","It's great seeing rallies etc and I love seeing my portfolio balance go up, but this is exactly the opposite of what we should be hoping.

The market falling 20% from here IS A GOOD THING in every possible way for wealth building.

First, it helps to eliminate downside risk. Would you rather buy at 3800 and then fall to 3000 or 2500?
Ot would you rather buy at 3000 and then fall to 2500 or even eventually rise to 4000?

Would you rather be buying MSFT at 27 pe or at 18 pe?

The lower the market goes, the MORE stocks you can buy with the same amount of money weekly!

It was John Bogle  that said something like ""Young investors should be praying for a huge market crash..""

As bad as market crashes and downturns may be for the economy, they are actually GOOD things. They get rid of excess, speculation, overspending, etc.

It's like a great reset and a healthy economy needs resets every once in a while. That's what's happening now.

The FED was greedy and over the last 12 years has fed the greedy multi millionaires and billionaires and we are now paying the price of this excess unfortunately. 

I'm not wishing retired or older people to lose money. They should already have their risk tolerance set to their age etc.

I'm saying that 20 to 40 year olds should be hoping the market goes way down.

It will eventually recover.

So if the sp500 falls to 2000 let's say and then you buy in with $50k.

Let's say the market eventually gets back to 4000 from 2000?

You 2x your money!

So if you have $500k at sp500 2000 and in 5 years the market is back to 4000 you cash out an you're a millionaire. 

That's how we have to think.

The money is not for today. It's for when you retire some day!

I'm not retiring for at least 20 years so I have plenty of time left to accumulate. I want the market to stay flat to down for the next 10 years and then gradually go up.

So imo everyone should be holding a lot of cash right now anticipating that the market will likely get to 3200 or so.

Don't buy in now imo. It's a mistake.

Being 40% cash I'm not concerned with the market going up or down short term.

And that means up to a year.

For example if the market somehow magically goes to 4500 this summer or next fall I'll trim and add more to my cash section.

If we go down to 3200 I siphon some of my 40% cash into either the index or my favorite stocks.

From 3200 to 4000 again? Then I trim back to 30% or so etc.

You have to be strategic in volatile markets.

I picture a cup overflowing. One side is equity and the outside of the cup is cash.

As my portfolio swells it dumps into the cash part.

As it falls it sucks cash back into equity again!

As it rises again it creates more and more cash and consequently we slowly get richer!

Yes dcaing into vti etc will also work but I think at certain levels you can time the market for an edge.

For we example if the market fell to 2000 tomorrow I'd go ALL in!  100% in and simply hold.

If we eventually rose again to 4000 in 2 years I'd take a 2x profit and start the process over again.

To survive the upcoming volatility you have to stay on your toes and be vigilant.

So we need to have a proper risk allocation!

Mine is 60/40. 

60% equity and 40% cash. No bonds, no treasuries, just cold hard cash in mm that I can access quickly on dips.

Dips to me aren't 5%. They're at very least 10%. I am anxiously awaiting 20% or more dips. That's where you start getting rich!

So I wish everyone the best in 2023. It's going to be a great year I predict.

But please keep a conservative asset allocation adjusted to your OWN tolerance for risk. Only YOU can decide this.

Most importantly  stay healthy, get sleep and exercise and don't smoke, eat junk food etc.

Health is wealth they say.

Good luck all!",finance,1672196824

My ex and I last filed jointly in 2018. I knew something was fishy with it because our total income was only about $5000 more than my income alone.

personalfinance,Really confused on how to fix a simple mistake for 2021 Federal 1040. 1040-X did not work.,"Hello everyone. I'm trying to help my uncle with this. 

My uncle has a super basic tax return. He has 2 children. One is on his own and like 26 and does his own taxes. Call him John. The other is 20 and in college and a dependent, which gets my uncle the $500 additional dependent credit. Call him Chris.

So my uncle screwed up and put the social security # of John as a dependent on the tax return, despite putting the name of Chris. So it's like this.

Chris - John's SS#

So, my uncle got a letter in November saying that the dependent he claimed cannot be claimed since John has done his own taxes.

The instructions seemed unclear. They kind of made it sound like you're not supposed to do anything, but also said that if you put the wrong person, to do a 1040-X Amended Return. It did not say the additional dependent credit of $500 was lost or anything.

To be proactive since we were expecting for them to take away the $500 eventually, I told my uncle to just do the 1040-X since the SS# is obviously wrong. He did that with a full explanation in the form and simply put the same name with the correct social security. According to the 1040-X instructions, that's all you had to do. Nothing else changed.

He just got a new letter 178C today saying that they couldn't amend anything and that he needs to explain why he's doing the 1040-X. But, he did explain in the original 1040-X. 

So now we're both confused on what additional information they need. It straight up says to do a new 1040-X and to explain, but I'm not sure how much more you can explain ""I put the wrong SS# and I'm fixing it with the correct one""

Is he supposed to just wait till the actual $500 credit is lost and a bill comes before correcting it? I thought being proactive would help.

It was still close to a 200k profit in 7 years so I cant complaint but identical houses in my neighborhood went for 610 and 670 in the last 6-9 months…i know the market cooled with interest rates but was really anticipating a number closer to 600 to help with the downpayment and it seems it has driven our monthly payment higher than I would have liked and we’ve had to put 30k down from our savings that we did not anticipate. Total downpayment around 235k, loan amount about 630k.

My income for the year is 125k + a 20% annual bonus so about an additional 25k before taxes.

My wife makes about 105k. Totaling 230k plus bonus.

We do our best to max out our 401ks, so our take home after taxes and contributions is roughly $11,300 a month. This mortgage is going to be roughly $4300. We are doing a 10 year ARM in order to get our rate to 5.3 (Hoping this doesn’t come back to bite us down the line). This equates to about 38% of our take home pay going toward our house. 

We don’t have a lot of other debts besides 1 car payment for $250 a month, but other utilities like electric, car insurance, groceries  add up.

We’ll have about 60k in savings left after we contribute more to the downpayment and another 40k in a brokerage fund. Our 401ks are at around 100k each, hoping this will rebound a bit with the economy aslike everyone else’s theyre way down for the year.. We are 34 and 35 years old.

Did we overextend ourselves with this mortgage? I know the rule of thumb is 28% of gross income, but what about net income? I don’t want to be house poor and am having a bit of buyers remorse going from a $1900 a month mortgage and 2.8% interest rate to $4300 and a 5.3. 

My only thoughts on getting the money would be to contribute less to the 401k, or strictly using my bonus as a side account for mirtgage payments. Take $1500 from that a month and put it towards the house.

Anyway, like many of you I was bummed to see Hogan's final video a couple weeks ago. Whether he was delivering good or bad news, his videos always gave me a sense of sanity. By the start of 2022 when it came to xrp I didn't even bother keeping up with any other news outlets, just waited for the next Hogan drop.

Given that it was his ""final"" one, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of it posted here to look back on as well as for any new xrp holders who might not know about his channel, so here goes.

Link to video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1\_xVnRyPE&amp;t=584s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1_xVnRyPE&amp;t=584s)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Both parties have filed final replies of the motions for summary judgement. The case is officially in front of Judge Torres (technically she could render an opinion at any time)

Attorney James Filon believes a final decision will be made on or before March 31, 2023

&amp;#x200B;

**The SEC's final brief**

(Hogan notes this brief was better than the initial two)

Summary paragraph:

*“Undisputed facts show that investors paid money for XRP and Ripple stated it would use those funds to promote and try to find use and value for XRP. Ripple also told investors that if it was successful, demand for XRP would increase permitting Ripple investors to profit. XRP investors including institutional ones paid over 2B dollars for XRP because they reasonably expected Ripple and its principal decision makers who had a “giant pile” of or who were “very long” XRP to honor the promises they had made and to do what they were financially compelled to do: use XRP sales proceeds to fund extensive effort to increase XRP’s value.”*

SEC brought up past cases they had prosecuted successfully as persuasive authority, including:

1. Telegram
2. Library
3. Kick Interactive (the most problematic since it was decided in the same court as Judge Torres is in)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ripple’s final brief**

Main arguments:

1. SEC hasn't proven that all alleged sales of XRP involved money
2. XRP was not sold as an investment contract
3. There was no common enterprise
4. XRP purchasers did not rely on Ripple to increase XRP's price

Summary paragraph

*“In short, the SEC is asking the court to rewrite the statutes that define its authority. For the SEC to prevail in its opposition the court would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a investment contract without any contract, without any investor rights, and without any issue or obligations. It would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a “common enterprise” even if the SEC cannot say what the enterprise is or prove any of the elements that define such enterprises. And it would have to endorse the SEC's theory that purchasers could reasonably have expected profits from Ripple's efforts even though Ripple never promised to make any efforts, even though it expressly disavowed any obligation to do so, and even though profits were overwhelmingly due not to Ripple's efforts but to Market forces. The court would also have to conclude that all amici that have expressly said they did not join a common enterprise or expect profits from Ripple's efforts are wrong about their own beliefs and actions.”*

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**Four possible outcomes to the Ripple litigation:**

**1: RIPPLE WINS AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

Hogan and other lawyers believe this is the most likely outcome due to the expectations of profits prong and common Enterprise problem.

The law requires a common Enterprise between the seller and the buyer of an asset and in the state of New York the Revit case is binding Authority. It defines a common Enterprise as one in which all of the investor’s assets are pooled together and the investors all share the risk of profits and losses from the scheme.

SEC has no real answer to this and only spent \~5 pages out of 55 in its latest brief addressing it. From page 7:

*“Investors reaped their profits in the form of the increased value of the token that all investors held and Ripple established a common Enterprise by pooling the funds and using them for its operations including the construction of the digital ecosystem it promoted. This ecosystem was crucial.”*

The SEC has two big problems with that argument:

1. The XRP Ledger had been in existence long before the sales were made so none of the sales money was actually used to build the Ledger
2. The appreciation or depreciation in the token value was based on general market forces and not related to Ripple’s efforts (required by the Revit case)

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional pro Ripple notes:

1. SEC has not provided any evidence that Ripple ever made any legally binding investment contracts to XRP holders
2. Attorney John Denton submitted hundreds of affidavits from actual XRP holders many of which had never even heard of Ripple when they bought XRP
3. The SEC abandoned its expert witness on the issue as to whether Ripple's efforts had any effect on the price of XRP
4. Ripple’s expert witness analysis established that generally (and especially since 2018) the price of XRP moves based on the crypto market rather than on business decisions by Ripple

&amp;#x200B;

SEC’s best evidence that Ripple communicated to investors = Chris Larson’s 2014 interview statement about utility and liquidity growing the network the value of XRP

SEC must meet burden of proof that anyone reasonably relied on that one interview to make a decision to purchase XRP. Given how obscure the interview was, Hogan doubts the SEC will be able to present reasonable evidence of this.

&amp;#x200B;

Two more major pro Ripple notes:

1. Paradigm’s (investment company) Amicus Brief - law firm reviewed 266 legal decisions related to Securities violations.

*“A comprehensive analysis of federal and appellate law reveals that no Authority exists to support the SEC's attempt to transmute the Howie analysis of an investment contract transaction into a conclusion about the underlying asset. In every application of Howie where an investment contract was found there was some identifiable lead legal relationship between an ostensible issuer and the investor providing investment capital.”*

2. One of the cases that the SEC relied on in its reply brief was Davis v Rio Rancho Estates and in that case the court actually held that:

*“There was no management contract between plaintiff and defendants nor were defendants obligated by the purchase agreement to perform any such services and in the absence of a common Enterprise between the parties the expectation of a profit on resale is insufficient to transform what is essentially a sale of real property into the sale of an investment contract.”*

&amp;#x200B;

Hogan has spoken to other lawyers who believe that Ripple may win on this issue on an appeal not at the trial court level but at an appellate court due to the scope of the ruling.

Based on Judge Torres other rulings, Hogan speculates she is the type of Judge that would take the initiative to just go ahead and rule on something as big as this (more on this later\*).

&amp;#x200B;

**2: RIPPLE LOSES AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

A loss could happen for several reasons:

1. Judge Torres decides that the fundamental statutory analysis of whether investment contracts require post-sale obligations is too novel an issue for her to decide and would prefer it went to an appellate court.

Sometimes it’s easier for a judge to rule against you knowing that you will then appeal and then let the appellate Court tackle the issue and then the judge at the trial level doesn't have to deal with it.\*

2. Judge Torres evaluates the four prongs of the Howie test and agrees with the SEC that there existed a common Enterprise because Ripple simply used the money from the sales of XRP to fund its business.

Particularly from 2013 to 2018 there really wasn't much consumptive use for XRP that we have evidence of and it must have been bought therefore for speculative use.

3. Ripple loses on the reasonable expectation of profit prong. The one thing the SEC did a good job of in its earlier briefs is laying out all of the statements, emails, and YouTube videos of various Ripple employees talking about the price of XRP (8 years worth of content). From their brief:

*“The question is whether Ripple lead potential investors to reasonably expect profits from its efforts. That is an objective question answered by economic reality and Ripple's representations not by individual motivations.”*

**Is a loss necessarily bad?**

A loss would only really be bad if it put Ripple out of business, which would occur if the resulting fines were high enough.

Brad Garlinghouse recently said that Ripple has a billion dollars and a ton of XRP in escrow.

The SEC’s initial complaint shows that Ripple was alleged to have sold illegally from 2013 through the third quarter of 2020 1.388 billion dollars worth of XRP. So the worst possible fine amount would equal that plus fines.

Even if Ripple were to be charged the full amount, it could theoretically survive given how much liquidity it has on hand.

**Sales Split**

The judge could also decide that only early sales of XRP were sales of Securities but at some point the sales lost that designation and became non-security sales.

I.e. if only sales of XRP up through 2018 when the on-demand liquidity use case came into being were illegal sales, the amount of sales reduces by almost half.

Hogan highly doubts that a split of sales ruling would happen due to how incredibly complex the framework would need to be. Certain sales of Ripple were made to institutional, others in open market, others were sequestered from Ripple's general funds and separate accounts, some were made to U.S citizens, many were made to International citizens and those sales don't count under U.S federal law.

&amp;#x200B;

**3: SURPRISE RULING THAT RESULTS IN JURY TRIAL**

The Fair Notice defense and Hinman emails

The Hinman emails make an appearance in Ripple’s brief on page 23 but are only used to back up a very specific point, Ripple’s Fair Notice defense.

Ripple took a big gamble by arguing in its initial brief that it isn’t proper for the judge to rule on the Fair Notice defense and that a jury should decide it at trial, then completely stopped arguing about it.

This is dangerous because the SEC has continued talking about it and in their last brief argued that the judge, not a jury, should decide the Fair Notice issue meaning it should be ended here.

The SEC argues the Fair Notice shouldn’t go to trial because it allows the defense to greatly lengthen the trial by permitting defendants to proffer evidence about the SEC's internal deliberations and the beliefs of countless Market participants which would all require rebuttal from the SEC.

In addition, because Ripple would be able to offer evidence about what we the SEC actually did or didn't do we'd have to defend ourselves which isn’t appropriate.

\*Similar to the appellate court appeal, Judge Torres could prefer not to deal with this case and by sending it to jury remove herself from making a decision.

A jury trial would not happen until at the earliest the summer of 2023 and possibly even later.

&amp;#x200B;

**4: UNEXPECTED DECISION (i.e. grants Ripple’s Fair Notice defense)**

Hogan mentions that  unpredictable things can happen in court on occasion. He mentioned granting the Fair Notice defense as an example, but left this pretty wide open in terms of possibilities.

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

And that about wraps it up. Ideally, I'd hope to see one last Hogan video of him and his wife celebrating a Ripple win and xrp reaching a million dollars per coin. Or, less ideally, if this stupid shit goes to jury trial and there's another decade of kangaroo court maybe the silver lining is we'll get to see Hogan videos again covering those updates.

Honestly, I've been feeling kind of optimistic as of late. I could see the trial ending by 2169, give or take a few hundred years. Seriously though, XRP WILL PREVAIL. God wouldn't have made Hogan if that wasn't the case. See you all on Uranus 😎

XRP,Summary of last Hogan video,"Happy holidays fellow xrp holders. Man it's been a fuckin journey. And I'm only 3 years in, my god some of you elite OGs are gonna be a decade in soon.

Anyway, like many of you I was bummed to see Hogan's final video a couple weeks ago. Whether he was delivering good or bad news, his videos always gave me a sense of sanity. By the start of 2022 when it came to xrp I didn't even bother keeping up with any other news outlets, just waited for the next Hogan drop.

Given that it was his ""final"" one, I thought it'd be nice to have a summary of it posted here to look back on as well as for any new xrp holders who might not know about his channel, so here goes.

Link to video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1\_xVnRyPE&amp;t=584s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok1_xVnRyPE&amp;t=584s)

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

Both parties have filed final replies of the motions for summary judgement. The case is officially in front of Judge Torres (technically she could render an opinion at any time)

Attorney James Filon believes a final decision will be made on or before March 31, 2023

&amp;#x200B;

**The SEC's final brief**

(Hogan notes this brief was better than the initial two)

Summary paragraph:

*“Undisputed facts show that investors paid money for XRP and Ripple stated it would use those funds to promote and try to find use and value for XRP. Ripple also told investors that if it was successful, demand for XRP would increase permitting Ripple investors to profit. XRP investors including institutional ones paid over 2B dollars for XRP because they reasonably expected Ripple and its principal decision makers who had a “giant pile” of or who were “very long” XRP to honor the promises they had made and to do what they were financially compelled to do: use XRP sales proceeds to fund extensive effort to increase XRP’s value.”*

SEC brought up past cases they had prosecuted successfully as persuasive authority, including:

1. Telegram
2. Library
3. Kick Interactive (the most problematic since it was decided in the same court as Judge Torres is in)

&amp;#x200B;

**Ripple’s final brief**

Main arguments:

1. SEC hasn't proven that all alleged sales of XRP involved money
2. XRP was not sold as an investment contract
3. There was no common enterprise
4. XRP purchasers did not rely on Ripple to increase XRP's price

Summary paragraph

*“In short, the SEC is asking the court to rewrite the statutes that define its authority. For the SEC to prevail in its opposition the court would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a investment contract without any contract, without any investor rights, and without any issue or obligations. It would have to endorse the SEC's theory that there can be a “common enterprise” even if the SEC cannot say what the enterprise is or prove any of the elements that define such enterprises. And it would have to endorse the SEC's theory that purchasers could reasonably have expected profits from Ripple's efforts even though Ripple never promised to make any efforts, even though it expressly disavowed any obligation to do so, and even though profits were overwhelmingly due not to Ripple's efforts but to Market forces. The court would also have to conclude that all amici that have expressly said they did not join a common enterprise or expect profits from Ripple's efforts are wrong about their own beliefs and actions.”*

&amp;#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&amp;#x200B;

**Four possible outcomes to the Ripple litigation:**

**1: RIPPLE WINS AT SUMMARY JUDGEMENT**

Hogan and other lawyers believe this is the most likely outcome due to the expectations of profits prong and common Enterprise problem.

The law requires a common Enterprise between the seller and the buyer of an asset and in the state of New York the Revit case is binding Authority. It defines a common Enterprise as one in which all of the investor’s assets are pooled together and the investors all share the risk of profits and losses from the scheme.

SEC has no real answer to this and only spent \~5 pages out of 55 in its latest brief addressing it. From page 7:

*“Investors reaped their profits in the form of the increased value of the token that all investors held and Ripple established a common Enterprise by pooling the funds and using them for its operations including the construction of the digital ecosystem it promoted. This ecosystem was crucial.”*

The SEC has two big problems with that argument:

1. The XRP Ledger had been in existence long before the sales were made so none of the sales money was actually used to build the Ledger
2. The appreciation or depreciation in the token value was based on general market forces and not related to Ripple’s efforts (required by the Revit case)

&amp;#x200B;

Some additional pro Ripple notes:

1. SEC has not provided any evidence that Ripple ever made any legally binding investment contracts to XRP holders
2. Attorney John Denton submitted hundreds of affidavits from actual XRP holders many of which had never even heard of Ripple when they bought XRP
3. The SEC abandoned its expert witness on the issue as to whether Ripple's efforts had any effect on the price of XRP
4. Ripple’s expert witness analysis established that generally (and especially since 2018) the price of XRP moves based on the crypto market rather than on business decisions by Ripple

stocks,What's fundamentally different about Tesla 2019 vs Tesla 2022?,"[https://i.redd.it/hibjqpvq7l8a1.jpg](https://i.redd.it/hibjqpvq7l8a1.jpg)

Tesla is now trading at $106 AH.

 I noticed just a few small differences...

* Musk liquidates billions in stock to buy Twitter
* Elon saying that he will sell BILLIONS MORE stock in 2025 or sooner
* Fed raising interest rates will hurt auto industry as a whole
* Tesla has a few more factories, Germany can't hire anyone due to uncompetitive compensation compared to other German auto makers, while Tesla is planning layoffs in US factories and temporary shutdown in China
* Elon thinks supporting alt-right will suddenly become environmentalists and embrace EV's instead of their redneck coal-rollers
* Elon thinks supporting Republicans will get him more EV support programs from Congress
* Consumer Reports rating Tesla as WORST in build quality (at a time when...)
* Legacy automakers catching up (Hyundai EV just won highest 5 star safety rating European standards) and have decades of established quality manufacturing standards
* Unpredictable Russia Ukraine war
* Higher labor costs
* Higher raw materials costs
* Chip shortage
* Higher logistics costs
* Musk alienating his first to adopt audience turning them against Tesla causing enough decline in demand that even $7500 off sale and 3x markdowns in China can't fix
* Tesla opened up charging network to nab some capital from government grants but shooting themselves in the foot at the same time
* A little thing called GLOBAL RECESSION

Tesla's record PE was 192.  They're sitting at about 30.  Industry average is about 6.

Every bubble has to burst and we may have just witnessed Tesla's tulip moment.",finance,1672210286

Absolutely not.

# [Stock futures climb fractionally as investors look to new year](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures climbed fractionally Wednesday morning as traders look to the end of a losing year and prepare for 2023.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 91 points, or 0.27%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures were up 0.25% and 0.2%, respectively.
*****
&gt; Investors will look for insights into the state of the economy in manufacturing data from the Richmond Federal Reserve and pending home sales coming Wednesday morning. Market participants will be looking for numbers that can signal the economy is cooling, which they hope could indicate to the Fed that interest rate hikes can continue slowing.
*****
&gt; Tuesday kicked off the start of a holiday-shortened trading week. The Dow rose 37.63 points, or 0.11%, to close at 33,241.56. The S&amp;P 500 fell 0.40%.
*****
&gt; The Nasdaq Composite shed nearly 1.4%, driven down by an 11% drop in Tesla stock after The Wall Street Journal reported that the electric vehicle maker would continue a weeklong production pause at a Shanghai facility. Tuesday marked the seventh straight day of losses for the stock.
*****
&gt; It comes at the end of a tumultuous year for the electric-vehicle maker as owner Elon Musk executed a chaotic purchase of Twitter. Tesla’s share value is down 69% this year.
*****
&gt; “A year ago, Musk was a hero and there was panic buying to the upside,” said Eric Jackson, founder of EMJ Capital, on “Closing Bell: Overtime.” “Right now ... it’s panic selling.”
*****
&gt; With three trading days left in 2022, the stock market is on track for its worst year since 2008. The Nasdaq has performed the worst of the three indexes, losing 33.8% this year as investors rotated out of growth stocks amid rising recession fears. The Dow and S&amp;P 500 are on track to lose 8.5% and 19.7%, respectively.

business,what to do? any advice?,"Hello to everyone,
My father owns a small winery and wineyards. He's an average business man I'd say, our business is in a stall for the past 10 years, we have almost the same profit every yea but no growth, we have no debts tho  I currently work for the most important winery of my area to make experience. My father will retire next year and I will be the one to manage the business. While I know how to do everything wine related, I have absolutely 0 experience with the financial part ( investments, loans ecc ecc ).
Where do I learn this? Are there any general rules to follow? What should I worry about when it comes to loans,  interest rates, inflation, payments ecc ecc. Any advice to a future director of a business?
Unfortunately I can't hire a manager for those things because we don't make enough profit to pay for someone in a position like this.

stocks,What are your predictions for 2023,"2022 was quite the different year than 2021.  Going into 2022 everyone thought the bull run would not end, but due to record inflation and interest rate hikes the SP500 is down \~19.85% year to date.  Based on the Fed we know we will still see some interest rate hikes, but not too the extent of what they were in 2022.  So what is your prediction for 2023?  

What stocks will perform the best (excluding penny stocks)?

What is your prediction for where the SP500 will end next year? Do you think it will continue to decline or will we go into a bull market?

personalfinance,401K Employer Lump Sum Match,"Morning,

My employer matches 401K  contributions once per year in a lump sum instead of every pay period. It appears this contribution happens on March 1st.

I'm mentally done though and about to ask for full remote and a pay raise. If not getting it, I'm prepared to walk away. I'm uncertain though... if I quit before this contribution hits, will I even get it? Luckily I'm only 8 weeks away. But if possible I'd like to make it 2-4 weeks left.

Obviously this question is best answered by HR. But it'd be an awkward conversation/question. Should I wait it out before ultimatum? I'm currently in a difficult to fill role, we are already short staffed with my peer on  the verge of retirement. I frequently receive praise, thanks and received a performance bonus for my efforts so I don't expect they would cut me loose early. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all. I appreciate your responses and thoughts.

Even though very unlikely that I would be removed from my position... I think it'd be wisest to wait until the contribution hits my account before making waves.",finance,1672239531

personalfinance,Early 401k withdrawal,"I may be changing careers as early as Jan 2023.  I know everyone is going to say hold on to it, roll it over, ect and I very well might, but I want to know the cash out option and tax implications for 2023. 

I'll take the %10 penalty on say 50k. 

Questions, 
Will I be taxed on as if the full amount was income before the penalty, or after? 45k vs50k 

Will that income go towards my 2023 taxable earnings or would they use 2022 earnings?  I don't know why they would back track but I want to be certain. 

If I start a new 401k or tax free retirement account, that would begin offsetting my taxable income for the 2023 year and giving me almost a full year to minimize the tax impact? 

After the penalty the 401k would be paid out in full to me? 


I'm estimating next year I would fall into the over 89k but under 170k tax bracket.  Meaning I would be looking at a %6 (NJ) income tax and %24 for federal that's including my 401k earnings.

Am I missing something in calculating the cost of early 401k withdrawal? Im fully vested in the 401k and in NJ if that matters,  Thanks.",finance,1672242026
personalfinance,25 year old Dental Student Need Help on What to Do?,"Hello,

I am a third-year dental student and need some financial advice—brief background about me. I graduate in May 2024 with a DDS, and starting salary around where I want to work will be $170,000. I started a company last year and made some good money. I think with the way the business is going, I will probably make around 70,000 profit next year, 2023 (worse case, prob 50,000). The dilemma I am in is whether I should focus heavily on paying off my dental school loan debt. I took out my first two years or if I should focus on investing since I graduate in a year and would rather have equity.

I started dental school in August of 2020. Between August 2020- August 2021. I have taken out a total of 120,000 average interest is 5% of student loans. All are federal, and I am hoping 20k will get forgiven because of Biden. Also, the interest is frozen until June 30th, 2023, and might even get extended.

**Income breakdown**

I started my business in August 2021

From August 2021- Dec 2021

≈22,000 made

From Jan 2022- Dec 2022

≈60,000 made

My expenses

I live at home, so there are few expenses, but I come from an immigrant background. We are big on supporting the family. So I usually give my parents/siblings money whenever they ask. So since August 2021, I have given close to 15K to parents and siblings. I have also splurged a bit and taken a couple of international trips. But since I now want to get serious about my finance, I plan on limiting my expenses to

**Future Expenses**

Fixed 500 per month, so ≈6,000 a year

Travel 2,000 all year (I have 2 weddings to attend in the summer)

So that is my background, and this is my plan.

**Plan for 2023**

I plan on making 70,000. The thing about this business is it fluctuates and payments come in 3-4 large sums. For example, I would get paid 20,000 in Jan, then 15,000 in May, then 15,000 in Sept, then 20,000 in Dec. Some quarters are really slow, and some are really high. But I anticipate the end of the year would be around 70,000. I also fear that I will not make any money since this business depends solo on me, and some months, I get soo busy with school I can't focus on the business.

Currently, I have 15,000 in my business account (all profit Dec 2022), and 120,000 in debt. My game plan is not to take out any more loans until I graduate. I already paid off my tuition for the spring semester, which was 10,000.

So far, I have three more semesters of school left Summer 2023, Fall 2023, and Spring 2024. each semester will cost 10,000 = so 30,000 (which I plan on paying off and not taking any loans.)

The question I have is what should I do. Should I start investing in index funds and try to get better returns since by May 2024, I will be a dentist (and make 170,000), Then I can start paying off my debt? Or don't invest and start paying off the 120,000 (with the 20k forgiveness). I think I can get it down to 50k by the time I graduate. I also want to have a rainy day fund in case something bad happens. I am 25-year-old male, not married, and no kids. But I do plan on getting married right after I graduate.",finance,1672243452

stocks,The Bull Trap Argument for Mid 2023/2024,"Hello everyone,

I have a hypothesis that we'll see the economy pull back a quite a bit prior to setting up what I believe could be one of the largest bull traps ever.

My hypothesis is based on two things: unemployment and used car sales and how these two things affect the CPI.

I personally believe that the CPI is an incredibly flawed method for calculating inflation, as I believe it does not weigh the correct categories and gives too much weight to others.

Specifically with new and used cars. [To clarify, the price of new vehicles and used vehicles aged 2 to 7 years make up 9.218% of the CPI's calculation.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/used-cars-and-trucks.htm) It's split roughly down the middle, with used cars being 4.143% of the CPI.

I am outlining this because I believe that when Carvana files bankruptcy, they will flood the market with cheap used cars that will push the CPI down.

Their current TTM for cash flow is -2.04B, which is an average of -510M per quarter.

As of Q3 2022 they had about $2.58B worth of vehicles in inventory, $477M in cash and cash equivalents, and about $350M in short term investments they could potential liquidate.

Something to consider is that their inventory is calculated at current market value. Part of their bankruptcy filing will certainly require that they liquidate their inventory, and as they do so the value of those vehicles will drop in tandem. Between the cash they have on hand, their inventory, and their short term investments, they could potentially extend their tenure up to an additional 2 quarters. I believe once they start discounting vehicles they could potentially add an additional 3 quarters to that.

Something to consider is that they could also potentially get a bankruptcy loan. This would allow them to extend their life and try to reprice vehicles to their benefit again. I don't believe this will work in their favor, Carvana has become synonymous with poor management, and I believe that this would only prolong what is inevitable.

A few complicating factors for Carvana, is that discounting vehicles will force competitors to also discount their vehicles which may force Carvana to discount further and result in them selling their inventory for significantly less than what it is currently priced at. We will likely see competitors like Shift also file bankruptcy. Carmax will also likely see a huge dip in their stock price at this time.

Additionally, this is all happening during a recession, meaning that consumer spending will be incredibly low, the discounts or incentives it would take to lure customers in during a recession, especially for a product as durable as a vehicle would have be fairly significant in my opinion.

[The CPI also takes into consideration average retail prices, personal computer prices, hotels and motels, even telephones and communication hardware.](https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/)

These are all things that people will be spending less money on as household incomes drop, and therefore the resulting decrease in demand will lower their prices.

All of this aggregates into a lower CPI value. I believe that the federal government and investments firms will try to use this to gas light the public's confidence in the economy. Inevitably this always seems to work. Folks will start investing and spending again and this will create a huge bull rush in the market, ""..buy the dip.."" and whatever other hot button words they can think of.

Then everyone realizes that just because cars are cheaper, it does not mean we are not heading deeper into a recession. The end. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

**tldr;** I think Carvana files bankruptcy, CPI drops because of how it weighs used cars in it's calculation. People think the economy is doing better, they throw a bunch of money back into the stock market, and then people realize that the economy is still going into a recession and that we just have more affordable cars to now.",finance,1672249765

Late 20's, 83k gross income, recently married, only personal debt is 90k PPLUS Loans in parent's name. 44k in savings, 30k in multiple retirement accounts and investments. If/when loans come back, I'm paying 1.7k per month currently on the 4 PPLs. Never missed a payment, then pandemic/ loan freeze happened. During then, paid off any grad loans in my name (around 25k). So no debt physically tied to my name.

90k Undergrad Direct Parent Plus Loans Breakdown: $14,737, 24,449, 24,471, 26,671 - rates vary between 6.5-6.9%. Not banking on it at all, but 10k of my grad loans, 10k of undergrad PPLUS loans, and 10k of partner's loans (see below) would be open for forgiveness if that happens next year.

Partner's only personal debt is 28k in federal student loan debt, and they have an estimated 3 semesters (or what would be 17k in loans) to finish school. They have pension with current company, investing in it pretty aggressively. No kids, no fur babies between us. Thinking maybe another 1-2yr before kids.

I am breadwinner while partner is in school, but they could pull in 1-3k per month if doing both (has done some semesters, when school has ramped up, $0 those months). Without loans, biggest current expenses are rent/groceries. We are renting in the suburbs of a major city.

New to detailed budgeting as a couple (mostly on my own, I've just been diligent with loan payment, limited spending, living below means). But getting into charting our expenses, creating emergency funds, etc.

**Questions**:

1. Lease ends in March '23, desiring first property. Interest rates are still rough and property value hasn't returned to ""normal pricing"". Should we explore purchasing, go ham on the principle on my/our loans or invest that elsewhere? I don't want it sitting anymore in our accounts.
2. Evaluating taking out 1.7k each month and paying off principal on PPLUS loans.

investing,There needs to be a mechanism for shorting private companies.,"The ability to short in stock markets has created a new industry to itself: The vigilante (aka ""activist short seller""). Many major firms specialize in investigating criminal activity in publicly traded companies and exposing them to the authorities and/or investors, their payment for services comes from how they can short a company's stock and profit when it collapses. This vastly increases oversight, as it generally takes weeks or months for the Feds to act even when they have whistleblower complaints. It is also a highly efficient form of policing, as the short seller is paid only upon success.

However, publicly traded companies are only a tiny minority of all companies, and regulation from the Feds is often minimal. Here major frauds can persist for years and can crop up repeatedly. For instance, Greensill Capital was a private firm in supply chain financing, issuing low risk loans and passing them on to bond funds for a fee. Their crime was many of their loans were not low-risk secured loans, but high-risk unsecured loans, with the exec pocketing the price difference and allowing him to leverage up beyond what any bank would allow. This fraud was only discovered because his scheme blew up due to supply chain difficulties. I bring this up because an activist short seller could have found this fraud before it exploded if they had been looking.

There are [credit default swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditdefaultswap.asp) (CDS), the most widely traded ""exotic"" derivative, but not all crimes threaten to bankruptcy of firms and plus many of these fraudster don't have debt because they're simply ripping off VC firms and rich chumps (aka angel investors). The irony being that crowdfunding platforms have more anti-fraud protections than allegedly elite VC firms.

The question I have here is if it is possible to enter into a [total return swap](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/totalreturnswap.asp) with a private firm. These work by one party holds onto an investment for another, and gives the buyer of the swap the total return of that investment at the end of the year in exchange for a fixed payment. The buyer effectively has a leveraged position on the investment, as he makes fixed payments, but can get massive gains if the investment goes up or massive losses if investments go down (returns can be negative). The seller has a risk-reward akin to a loan, as he holds onto the investment and knows the buyer will cover gains/losses if solvent and receives a fixed payment.

These types of swaps are usually intended to let firms borrow more margin than the government ordinarily allows, but we have a different idea. The seller of the swap may NOT BE HOLDING ONTO THE INVESTMENT IN QUESTION. This means instead of a loan-like payoff he has a short-like payoff and will almost certainly not be collecting fixed payments since now he's the one taking risks. The swap could be the return of T-bills traded for the returns of a private equity stock subject to valuations from others. The person who is long on the contract won't care where he gets the return from ad he doesn't have to take any leverage if he doesn't want to. In fact, the person who is long on the contract is probably and investment banker who can easily pawn off the contract onto a diversified private equity fund who is content to own the whole market.

An alternative solution is to issue perpetual futures, which effectively side bets on the direction of some valuation that lasts as long as both parties are willing. However, that entails significant counterparty risk as any major price movement, even ones hidden by the secrecy of private equity, will inevitably trigger mass exits from these contracts. A future with an end date is problematic since due to the exclusive nature of private equity there will more than likely be no way of making physical delivery of shares. An return swap with an end date is likely better.

But just think. A market where anyone can get compensated for exposing any crime at any time. Talk about efficient markets.",finance,1672269322

The First Direct Declaratory Judgment Action, Against SBF et al., Is Now On File In Del. Ch. 11 Matter…
DECEMBER 28, 2022 ~ LEAVE A COMMENT
Largely echoing the affirmative statements I made yesterday, this morning the first of what will likely be dozens — if not hundreds — of customer lawsuits was filed, directly into the Chapter 11 proceedings, in Delaware federal court.

The gist of it is simple: funds deposited by customers, under standard customer agreements, NEVER belonged to Alameda or FTX. They were NEVER assets of the Chapter 11 debtors, for any purpose. They are thus beyond the other (unsecured) creditors’ reach in this bankruptcy — to the extent they still exist at all, or may be traced.

FTX US holds some customer funds to this day. It is not clear how much of them, exactly — but they are known to exist.

The main reason I link to this complaint in full is that it is a quite muscular telling of the brazen thefts — over several years — underway at Alameda and FTX entities (and the island domiciled real estate holding companies).

I suspect the able US Bankruptcy Judge Dorsey will ultimately rule that these customer funds are to be returned, forthwith — directly to the customers — wherever they are.

But I am equally sure that only a fraction of those original “customer account” amounts still exist, as we know from yesterday’s installment that some $546 million was used to buy Robinhood stock, without authorization — and that over 80% of that has gone up in NASDAQ price decline smoke — and mirrors.

So, do read it all. This is largely why Martin Shkreli held a live event today, to encourage SBF to plead guilty — to all of it, and maybe only get 20 to 40 years, instead of life without parole. Martin speaks from experience — and SBF should listen.""

As we get close to entering the new year, I thought I would be useful and relevant to analyze the market this past year. More specifically, to look at where we started, where we are at now, and where the market may head in the coming year. It is important for all traders/investors to reflect on their performance and see what they did right as well as what they did wrong. Doing this is a crucial element in improving your skills.

We started 2022 with a new high, but quickly pulled back from that level in the following trading sessions. If we look further back to September 2021 it is apparent that weakness is beginning to show in the market. We had a sharp pull back in September 2021 with heavy selling. The market was able to rally and recover but did so on low volume, indicating a lack in support on the buy side. As we went into the new year the market was weak and after the first trading day began to roll over.

The main culprit of the market rollover is increasing inflation as well as the Federal Reserves response. Inflation does seem to have peeked in July 2022, but this does not mean that interest rates will go back to near zero anytime soon. It is likely that fed rates will remain elevated until it is clear that inflation is tamed. Additional concerns extend from uncertainty due to the Russia-Ukraine war as well as rising Covid-19 cases in China resulting from the end of the zero tolerance covid policy.

With these hostile market conditions, many may think there is little to nothing to do in the market. That cannot be further from the truth, there is almost always some industry or sector that is experiencing positive price action. For instance, early in 2022 the oil and gas industry was booming as a result of decreasing covid restrictions as well as fuel price increases as a result of the Russia-Ukraine war. The shipping industry also produces several companies that had positive price increases throughout 2022. Lastly, there were several bear market rallies within the overall market and individual companies that were not only trade-able but also very profitable with proper risk management. While these are not the only industries that were positive in 2022, they serve as a basis to instill the idea that opportunities are all around us, we just have to find them.

Even with inflation subsiding, the market is on track to end the year close to its 52-week lows. So what will it take to regain ground lost in 2022? The answer is most likely Fed rate cuts with a side of global stability in terms of war and disease. However, the Fed is not likely to start rate cuts until mid 2023 at the earliest. As for global stability, there is not telling how long the Russia-Ukraine war will last as well as rising covid cases. So what does this mean for investors/traders? Should we just call it quits and wait for 2024? Obviously the answer is no. We need to keep a similar mindset as we have had this year. That is being cautious in our positions and knowing that this market is still very news driven. An article or economic data release can cause major swings in any direction. We have to be prepared to quickly get rid of losers because a small loss can easily turn into an unmanageable larger loss. For now enjoy the holidays and prepare yourself for a new year filled with limitless opportunities.

Feel free to add your thoughts on this past year and whats to come below!",finance,1672273950
solar,My Experience with Blue Raven Solar,"I wanted to share my experience with Blue Raven Solar for those shopping or considering home solar panels.

The rep was going door to door in our neighborhood in central NC selling solar panels systems for homes, we had been researching getting a system so we thought we would listen to what the company offered.

They analyzed our usage over the last 12 months, decided that the best system was roughly 9.3 kWh, which would offset about 86% of the usage from Duke Energy. 25-year manufacturer warranty, 10-yr roof warranty, 2-yr workmanship, 2-yr efficiency guarantee etc.

Price of the system was roughly 50k. $3.9k from the 18-month rebate from Blue Solar, plus the 30% Fed Solar credit which comes out to 15k We were told that they had great financing options as we don't have the money up front, we explored that. It was a 20-year 3.99% APR, so if we took the loan to term it would be $23k in finance charges, so we would pay $73k for taking the loan to term (less if we applied the $15k tax credit to the loan). We thought hard about it, we just bought the house a year ago and went in debt for that, plus credit card debt, so we just didn't feel good about going another $50k in debt.

We told them we didn't like the terms of the loan. They then countered and said if we secured our own financing or paid cash up front, then the price would drop to $34k for the system, plus the $10k 30% Fed credit. so $24k for the system.

So, if I see this correctly, they tried to sell the system for 15k higher because I wanted to use their preferred lender, but if I paid cash or got my own loan to cover it, the price magically drops to 34k.

Am I overthinking this, or did I avoid getting screwed?",energy,1672277199
personalfinance,I want to buy a home and car.,"I am 23, single, with no dependents. 80k gross. And I live in California.

I was contributing 30% into my 401k, but will now lower my contribution temporarily to employer match (5%) for 2023-2024 in order to save for a house and my dream car. I am still planning to max my roth IRA. I pay my credit card in full each month and have no student loans. My current car loan's interest rate is 3.94% scheduled to be paid off by Dec 2024, but I am planning to increase payments on the principal to pay it off by July/August 2023. No plans to sell my car / upgrade until I can buy my dream car. 

I currently have $34k in my 401k, 8k in my Roth IRA, 18k in a personal brokerage account, 6k for emergency funds, and a 3k vacation fund. 

Monthly Bills include: 

* Rent - $500 (self voluntary since I live with parents)
* Car Payment - $447 per month, but will likely be ~$1000 (~$500 additional principal) each month until paid off. It's an electric vehicle and I get free charging at work.
* Internet - $65
* Entertainment - $17 (Spotify, Disney+)  

This leaves me $2610 leftover each month to allocate for the following.

* 50.5% ($1318) in a HYSA (some portion in CDs)
* 7% ($183) for retirement (personal brokerage account long term mutual funds)
* 14.5% ($379) for the Roth IRA. 
* 28% ($731) for fun money (eating out, or personal wants). I don't usually spend this much and anything extra at the end of the month would go into extra car payment or savings. 

After my car loan is paid off, I plan to increase my 401k contribution back up to 15% and stick with the same proportions for saving. I would like to buy a house (somewhere in California) before my 30s so I could also start saving for my dream car. 

Is this a reasonable plan to save for a 20% down payment on a house?",finance,1672279558
personalfinance,Building savings vs early mortgage payoff,"Let me preface this by noting that I’m not looking to invest more in stocks/bonds.  This is simply between paying off a mortgage early or keeping the funds in saving.

When I first got my mortgage, six years ago, I secured a 30-yr fixed at 4.5%.  At that point, my savings account was paying out a measly .5% APY.  So during that time, I made it a point to dump as much free cash into my mortgage as possible, in order to pay down my mortgage sooner.

Fast forward to last year, when interest rates were at their lowest, I refinanced into a 12-yr fixed at 2.25%.  Since they increased my minimum payment, I spent the next year only paying the minimum.  I am now making more money and I face a conundrum.

Part of me wants to go back to paying down my mortgage early, since I hate the idea of being in debt for the next 11 years.  However, my online savings account is now paying me 4.11% APY, so I am literally making more money by just keeping the funds in a savings account.

Of course the logical side of me says to not pay down the loan early, but how do you balance that with the emotion of wanting to get out of debt?",finance,1672281027
personalfinance,Question about buying a short term used car,"My car was recently totaled when a girl on acid totaled 3 vehicles that were parked in front of our houses.  The auto market is obviously crazy right now, and I wasn't planning on car shopping, but here I am.  I have a question that I would love feedback on.

I've been looking at leasing a new car as I have a business that I can use to write it off, plus I won't have to worry about taking it to the mechanic hopefully, but money factors/interest rates are insanely high.  I thought maybe it could make sense to buy a used car with a good resale value, and then turn around and sell it within the next 6 months - 1 year.  This will buy me time to find something (my rental expenses are adding up), and there is also the possibility that interest rates will take a dip in 2023 (or so I've heard is a possibility). 

If I buy a used car, I believe that I have to pay tax on it if it's from a dealer, and if it's from a private party then I believe I have to pay tax on it when I register the vehicle w/the DMV (I'm in CA if that makes any difference).  

If I turn around and sell it within 6 months - 1 year, am I out those taxes?  It seemed like potentially a good idea until I considered that if I buy a car for $20k and have to pay $2k additional in taxes, then go to sell it let's say for $19k or whatever the market allows at the time, then I will still be losing the money I spent on the taxes?  Not sure exactly how this works, and would be grateful if anyone could shed light on this.",finance,1672281965
personalfinance,selling house while keep the original mortgage,"I know this is out of question, but forgive me to ask, in order to give the buyer some leverage to give me a better price, is that possible I can transfer my mortgage to  buyer?i.e. the buyer will continue to service my mortgage for the obvious reason, lower interest rate, 3.0%, the buyer can give me.much needed cash, and the buyer can live in my house.
I heard concepts like Tennant in common 

I have something with value, I can not refi to get all the equity, if buyer buys he will pay higher interest rate , we are in capitalism, is there something to work out here?

Fiction number, if the house will sold for 1.5m, I have 1m mortgage, if the buyer gonna finance 1.2m with 300k down, he will have a very happy time to inherit my mortgage, so with his benefit, could I get some extra cash?",finance,1672283046
personalfinance,How does buying more I Bond work,"I bought $5000 I Bond back in October with the high interest rate for the purpose of saving for college in less than 2 years. It will not qualify for tax exemption and I will lose 3 months of interest, I already know. But I bought it under the impression it was still better than any HYSA. So now I am want to put more funds into it but am trying to understand how it will play out. 

Since it compounds every 6 months, would it make any difference when in that 6 month period I buy more? So if I add $1000 to the $5000 in January, would interest gained after the purchase be calculated as $6000 or would it not until it compounds in April after the 6 months.

And since I would be purchasing after the initial purchase, would $1000 of the $6000 have to be held 1 year from the purchase of the $1000 or from the initial $5000 purchase?",finance,1672283578

Hi, I'm a college student filling out tax employment forms before starting my new internship this spring. I'm having some trouble understanding how to fill out the Georgia G-4 for withholding. There's info and tools (such as the IRS calculator) to supplement the federal W-4 in order to pay the correct amt of federal taxes and I'm looking for the same for state taxes. I'll be paid $26/hr on a biweekly basis for \~13 weeks and will be making roughly $13.5k - 14k by the end of the semester. I want to have another internship in fall 2023, but since I haven't secured it yet, the status of that income is unclear. Regardless, I'm assuming that taxes will be overwithheld from my paychecks based on my annual income under the assumption I'm working for the full year when I'm only working part of it (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it possible to minimize overwithholding with deductions on the G-4 like on the W-4? Does Georgia also have standard deductions, how does state income tax work? I can't really find a lot  of clear info on this. Trying to wrap my head around it, I would really appreciate any breakdown or insight, thank you!",finance,1672285865

We both claim “married, both spouses working” with 0 allowances. 

I’m confused as to why our employer (both the local public school system) doesn’t withhold enough money?  

On my biweekly paycheck, I only have 14% of my pay deducted as federal income tax from my taxable income. And that’s with the additional money I have my employer withhold…

personalfinance,American living oversees unable to pay down credit card debt,"TLDR: American living overseas working full time is unable to make progress paying down CCs and private student loans. What should I do?

Not sure if this is the right sub for this but looking for advice - let me know if I should go elsewhere! I am an American living overseas. I have a lot of debt that has built up over the past several years (all US originated and denominated in USD) - 88k federal student loans, 23k credit cards, 18k Sallie Mae student loans, and 22k personal loans from friends. I work a full time job (actually 55-70 hours a week), and my after tax pay is about 2000-2300 USD/month. After essentials (rent, groceries, transport to work, phone bill), I have about 1100 USD/month to put towards my loans. After 4 months, I've made less than $100 progress on the CCs and private student loans (my federal student loans and personal loans are deferred) - every month I pay down 1100 USD and then the interest hits and I'm right back where I started. I have no savings left, and while I'm looking at trying to change careers or get a new job, if I miss even one paycheque I will also fall behind on payments.

My questions:

1. What happens if I stop paying my credit cards or Sallie Mae? Can I be sued (effectively) in the EU/UK? Are collectors able to garnish my wages internationally? Are there other ways a judgement can be used against me? Can this prevent me from re-entering the US or lead to me going to jail if I do so?
2. Can I negotiate a settlement/file for bankruptcy in my situation/from overseas? What is the difference between Chapter 7 and Chapter 13 bankruptcy?

Any advice appreciated, even if its something that I'm not considering/haven't asked about.

A little more background - the federal loans are from undergrad, but the remaining debt built up from moving costs and finishing my degree where I live now. I came here to get a visa and a career start in this country, and my degree did put me in a good situation to do that, but I cannot afford to follow up on the opportunities I have sometimes without missing payments. I've double checked my monthly expenses and I don't really have any slack left in terms of cutting down rent costs or food.

Wages in this country are much lower than in the US in general, so in order to make substantially more I would have to move back to US. This would lose me my visa, I would likely accrue more debt/miss payments during the move, and I'm also extremely unwilling to return to the US. I'm considering defaulting on the loans or trying to file for bankruptcy, but I dont know how these work given that I am overseas. I realize the accounts will go to collections, but I have no US assets. I have no intention of returning to the US on any permanent basis besides to visit family, so I dont anticipate needing my US credit score or US bank accounts.

bonds,Your take on long term investment grade bond etf,"I see a lot of market analysts recommending people to go with short or intermediate term bonds only.    Is it wrong for me to think that long term bonds are more attractive nowadays as a long term investment?

Long term investment grade bonds etf are yielding upward of 4% these days, and if and when the Fed pauses or pivots, wouldn't long term bonds go up the most?  And even if the FED doesn't pivot, I am still sitting on a juicy 4% yield that has been impossible for over a decade now until this year.

Also,  I have no idea how bonds etf work but I would assume they have to constantly acquire new bonds when old or existing ones expire. So if new bonds acquisition are made, wouldn't that boost the overall yield of the bond etf too in a rising interest rate environment?

I am a boring kind of investor, am satisifed to sit on 4-5% interest rate long term as part of my fixed income portfolio that complements my long term S&amp;P investment.

I just find it odd that people are not as enthusiastic as I am about  long term bonds. If any market analyst talks about bonds, they all focus on short term.

Would like to hear what others think about this.  Thanks",finance,1672293589

CryptoMarkets,"Recap for 2022, how did it affect the cryptospace and investors .","2022 is about to end, so what were the interesting and scary events that happened in the cryptospace? 

There were many events but let's just see the top 10 events happened.

• Federal reserve raised interests multiple times.
• Bankruptcy of FTX
•Luna crash
•Ethereum Merge
•$550 million usd stolen from Ronin
•stepn listing and chain games getting viral
•Gas feed for otherside broke records
•Tha sanction of tornado cash by US treasury department
•Even the Blue chip Nfts faced liquidity crisis
• Yuga labs acquired Cryptopunks.

So effects of these events? 
The whole market is now having low liquidity, many Cex also are facing issues due to lack of users. People are doubting Cex to store money, even Binance is being questioned if it's safe or not. 

What to do now?  
For me I just transferred my holdings to ledger, and as a future trader and investor, I am using Mexc and Bybit at the moment for future trading and accumulating new potential gems. 

Why Mexc/ Bybit? 
It became the centre of attention in recent months, because of their exponential growth by maintaining the streak of 0 security breaches. They breached the user base of 10m , and also got rebranded this year. Whereas many Cex are facing liquidity issues as people are changing their Cex and shifting holdings to Ledger , it is getting more users with more liquidity. They always list potential projects before any Cex giving you a chance to get in early. 

Ftx bankruptcy had affected me a lot, as i had a decent holding in $FTT. The trust i have on the Cex, so i just bought some $Mx tokens as it is growing continuously and can gain a decent pump. Hoping for a good return as the exchange and the native token grow slowly.",cryptocurrency,1672303643
CryptoCurrency,The Key Factors That Could Spark the Next Crypto Bull Run,"Bull market in crypto are characterized by internal and external factors as they are linked to general investor confidence and optimism, as well as rising asset prices 

There are several exogenous factors that can contribute to the start of a new crypto bull market:

1. Economic growth: Strong economic growth can contribute to a bull market by increasing the demand for goods and services, leading to higher corporate profits and stock prices.
2. Low interest rates: Low interest rates can make borrowing cheaper, leading to increased investment and spending, which can drive stock prices higher.
3. Favorable government policies: Policies that support economic growth and stability, such as tax cuts and regulatory reform, can create a favorable environment for the stock market.
4. Corporate earnings growth: If companies are reporting strong earnings and revenue growth, it can increase investor confidence and drive stock prices higher.
5. Positive sentiment: If investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the future, they may be more likely to buy stocks, leading to increased demand and higher prices.  


But those  factors are only externaly correlated to crypto. For crypto to reach a bull run we need to look for those endogenous factors:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Increased adoption: As more people and institutions begin using cryptocurrencies, demand for them can increase, leading to higher prices.
2. Improved infrastructure: The development of new cryptocurrency exchanges, wallets, and payment systems can make it easier for people to buy and use cryptocurrencies, leading to increased demand.
3. Favorable regulations: If governments or regulatory bodies adopt policies that support the use of cryptocurrencies, it can increase investor confidence and drive demand for them.
4. Improved security: As the security of cryptocurrency systems improves, more people may be willing to invest in them, leading to higher prices.
5. Positive sentiment: If investors are feeling confident and optimistic about the future of cryptocurrencies, they may be more likely to buy them, leading to increased demand and higher prices. 
6. Institutional investment: When institutional investors, such as hedge funds and pension funds, begin investing in cryptocurrencies, it can increase demand and drive prices higher.
7. Increased media attention: When cryptocurrencies receive a lot of positive media coverage, it can increase awareness and interest in them, leading to higher demand and prices.
8. Partnerships and collaborations: If major companies or organizations announce partnerships or collaborations with cryptocurrency projects, it can increase the perceived value and adoption of those projects, leading to higher prices.
9. Market maturity: As the cryptocurrency market matures and becomes more stable, it can attract more investors and increase demand, leading to higher prices.
10. Innovation: The development of new technology or applications for cryptocurrencies can increase their utility and perceived value, leading to higher demand and prices.  


Overall, a combination of these factors could potentially lead to the next bull run in the cryptocurrency market. It is important to keep an eye on developments in these areas and be prepared to adjust your investment strategy accordingly.",cryptocurrency,1672304392

CryptoCurrency,Top 5 Crypto Hacks of 2022,"This year was crazy, but when we talk about 2022 we also gotta talk about hacks and scams. Here are my top 5.

Ronin Network — $625 million

On Mar. 29, Ronin, a sidechain that hosts Sky Mavis’ Axie Infinity game was exploited for $625 million in various crypto assets, making it the largest crypto heist to date. Sky Mavis developed Ronin to host its popular blockchain game Axie Infinity. But things took a turn for the worst when the team failed to secure the Ronin network from perpetrators, later identified to be North Korea's Lazarus hacking group. 

Through an email-based phishing attack on a former employee, the hacking group gained access to Sky Mavis’ IT infrastructure. There, the hackers located and stole private keys to Ronin blockchain validator nodes, which the firm stored on its internal servers. When the hackers had access to validator keys, they took control over the entire Ronin network and transferred more than 173,600 ether (ETH) and 25.5 million USDC stablecoin, totaling over $625 million. 

FTX — $370-$400 million 

Unlike other major security heists during the year — such as those affecting decentralized blockchain apps operating on smart contracts — the now-collapsed centralized exchange FTX fell for one of the largest hacks of 2022. Taking place in November, the FTX hack came to light after the exchange’s official Telegram admins reported “unauthorized access.” 

Onchain data showed that the exchange's wallets lost funds anywhere between $370 million to $400 million shortly after its former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. 

Wormhole — $325 million 

In February, Wormhole, a cross-chain bridge protocol, was hacked in this year’s biggest bridge exploit. Wormhole allows users to lock their ETH and receive a pegged asset called Wormhole ETH (wETH) on the Solana network. 

On Feb. 2, Wormhole fell to a hacker who spoofed certain security signatures on the bridge and minted 120,000 wETH worth $325 million out of thin air. The hacker swapped the illicitly minted wETH for actual ETH on the Ethereum network, thereby draining all of the assets held on Wormhole. 

Nomad — $190 million 

On Aug. 7, Nomad — a bridge connecting Ethereum, Avalanche, Moonbeam and Evmos blockchains — suffered the second largest cross-chain bridge hack of the year with $190 million worth of assets lost. The hack resulted from a faulty update in which Nomad developers erroneously designated 0x00 (the zero address) as the trusted root.

Beanstalk Farms — $182 million

Beanstalk Farms, a stablecoin protocol, was attacked in April of 2022 in the year’s largest governance hack.

An unknown hacker took advantage of a security loophole in Beanstalk's decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), which oversees the decision-making for the stablecoin project. On Beanstalk, anyone could submit a proposal and get it passed in a day if it received the majority votes from holders of Beanstalk’s native governance called bean",cryptocurrency,1672316610

stocks,what if we get deflation?,"I am generally of the opinion that the Fed really can do nothing  about deflation because every country that has tried rounds of QE can never escape. That said, the one thing it does seem to do is inflate the  hell out of equities. And the more ineffective the QE becomes the more  trashed in real and nominal terms become bonds and treasuries. Truly  worthwhile bonds begin to trade at such premiums you effectively lose  much of the ROI.  
Commodities, including silver and gold, are an  alternative to treasuries, not stocks. Conservative portfolios will  always want that. And the zero return of gold is still better  than the negative returns you lock in with treasuries. I think just  sitting on stocks is the way to go with inflation. They have been barely  outpacing inflation over the past 10 years. Gold or silver only become  worthwhile when your currency is going to zero, and you want to leave  your country. Forget Zimbabwe, that was the case in both Venezuela and  Turkey.  But what if we get deflation?",finance,1672320356

personalfinance,Pull Out FERS Contributions?,"I'm an about-to-turn 29 year old federal technician with about 3.5 years in federal service. It's been ... alright, but the pay is rough, so I'm making every effort to get into the private sector. When I make that move, the money in my FERS pension can be left in (if I wanted to return to federal service and continue paying in) or pulled out.

The plan right now is to pull it out, but it got me thinking -- who in their right mind at my age would keep it in even if they had 5 years and could do a deferred retirement? If I understand correctly, a 5 year retiree would earn 5% of their current pay in retirement. For me, .05\*75K=$3750 and if I collected that from 62 to 85, that'd come out to $86,250 collected **by 85**. 

Right now, I have about $10K in FERS. If I pulled that out and earned 7% average interest on it until 62, that'd come out to $100K at the age of 62. And that's not even comparing apples to apples because if I *did* stay in for 5 years, I'd have about $14K in and stand to have $125K **at 62**.

Now if I change the 7% to 5 or 6, then it does start to get a little closer, but it's not close enough to make me reconsider. I just want to make sure I'm not making some big error here because it seems too **bad** to be true. Like the only way to play the FERS retirement game and win is to do your 5 years right before you hit 62 -- even considering FERS at a younger age is absolutely foolish, no?",finance,1672324325

I have about $23K in student loans. I’ve been thinking about options/strategies on paying it down significantly when the loan deference ends in August of 2023.

I’m currently paying about $200 a month to have some kind of payments being made since I highly doubt student loan cancellation will happen.

My annual salary is about $70K pre-tax (Texas) which equates to about $4,200 a month. I have some money in my savings, however it’s not $20K. I do have some IRA (Roth &amp; 401K) accounts, but hesitant on touching them because of any penalizations that can occur. *Not familiar with how this works* I am thinking about using all my income tax return and putting it towards my loans.

My biggest expenses are my house, car, and insurance which is about $2,300 then I have little expenses that add up. I try to put $300-500 away in my savings each check. 

I’m fortunate enough to only owe $23K, but with interest rates accruing when student loans began I’m worried I’ll be in a deeper hole.

In July, I realized that my W-4 setting was way too high / too much money was being withheld from my paycheck, so I blocked my W-4 withholding altogether. 

For the last 5 months, I’ve been putting 25% of my gross paycheck in a Marcus HYSA labeled “Tax Fund.” So I’ve been earning a nice interest rate on that money, and after I finish calculating my taxes, I’ll make an estimated quarterly payment before the O4 deadline (on 01/15/2023). 

**My question is - am I missing something here? Isn’t it a bit of a “life hack” to completely block your employer from W-4 withholding (IF you are responsible enough to make the estimated quarterly tax payments yourself)?** 

Psychologically, I like seeing the larger amount of $$$ hit my bank account, and it makes me feel more in control to put 25% away to save for taxes. The interest payment is another added bonus. I'll have earned about $30 in interest on my ""tax fund"" in December alone.

stocks,Predictions and Sectors to Watch Out for in 2023: Thoughts and Discussion,"2022 has been tough for me as a rookie individual investor: so many uncertainties, fluctuations, and major policy shifts. I would like to humbly offer my thoughts on investment trends and sectors to watch out for in 2023.

======

Macro/Policy Trends

\-Fed must slow down rate hikes to rejuvenate the economy, but they will still have to tame inflation both for economic and for political reasons (I don’t believe in Fed neutrality anyway). Projection: the rate would top in summer-autumn 2023 and it would stay there for a while till Fed officials figure out what to do. A rate slash may not come until winter of 2023 or even early 2024 (coincidentally or not, to pave the political way for the next presidential election).

\-Russo-Ukraine war has exhausted both the Western powers and Russia, although it may have exhausted Russia more severely. The battlefront has largely been a stalemate since November, and there may not be any profound situational change until early Spring of 2023, when the weather and the terrain become suitable for large-scale actions again. Talks of peaceful resolution are circulating out there, but my projection is that neither side wants to settle quickly until the Spring 2023 actions produce a clearer view of situations. Hence, the geopolitical uncertainties of this war would linger for quite a while.

\-China’s U-turn of COVID lockdown policy, having been brewing for a while, still comes as a major surprise at the year’s end. However, although I do not condone the China-Imminent-Collapse view, I do not expect China to regain momentum soon. All the talks about supply chain relocation and investor cautions aside, the three-year lockdown (and especially the more draconian 18-month lockdown since mid-2021) has severely depleted China’s foreign reserve, rattled its consumption power and confidence, disrupted its labor force, and exposed its crippling weakness in social welfare provision. Even if China could power through the current wave of infection, it would still need some time to reset, restart, and contemplate what type of economic relations it wants with Western powers. What’s more, Xi Jinping has literally botched every grand strategic initiative since his second term starting in 2017-18: Belt and Road, hostility towards Western powers, indigenous high-tech development, ambition to bridge the domestic wealth gap, crackdown on tech and real estate sectors, Xinjiang/Uyghurs region, Hong Kong…. you name it. Now, the only major opportunity for him to garner some additional legitimacy for a fourth term and maintain the current surveillance state structure would be a war to invade/” reunite” Taiwan. With the COVID lockdown gone, his anxiety might cause him to take increasingly hostile moves against Taiwan, maybe even launch a preemptive (and hasty) strike soon. All in all, I do not expect much good news out of China and would refrain from investing heavily in its reopening/rejuvenation of the economy at least until winter of 2023.

\-Continuing the geopolitical trend, and finally as a wrap up, the major difficulty for me is to identify a geographical region exhibiting clear momentum of growth in 2023 that could inject new rigor into the world economy. Even amid the pandemic, China’s lockdown-and-keep-producing strategy allowed it to maintain decent economic growth in 2020; when China began to lose its steam in 2021, USA, Japan, and some major economic powers of South America as well as Europe began to walk out of pandemic lockdown and took over the banner for growth. But for 2023 it seems every major region in the world is grappling with their own economic difficulties and no one is ready to take the helm. Besides, the increasingly inward-looking mentality and security-based concerns might cause a new round of severance/reformulation of global economic connections. My view may be overly grim, but for me 2023 would continue to be a muddy, rough, and restructuring year.

======

Sectors/Investment Options (Both Positive and Negative Views)

\-Energy/Clean Energy: With the Russo-Ukraine war still having no end in sight, global energy security continues to be an issue. Major powers will continue to spend strenuous efforts to secure only oil and gas resources, but also the pipeline carrying them. Talks about clean and alternative energy continue to thrive, but it appears the major concern is safeguarding more traditional options. I would probably maintain a 60-40 mix of traditional/fossil energy and clean/alternative energy.

\-Healthcare/Pharmaceutical: Another major sector I will be keeping an eye on. With COVID still raging in some parts of the world, vaccination/dedicated medicines still pose some opportunities. One interesting thing I would love to track is whether China would finally give up its “not losing face” stance and start importing foreign COVID vaccines (they rejected foreign mRNA vaccines but have begun importing medications in small amount). Even with COVID pandemic in rear mirror, global population continues to get older, and needs for combating new viruses/difficult diseases continue to exist. This is a long-term sector I will keep investing in.

\-Real Estate/Housing: With Fed rate hikes, house buying seem to have seceded from the 2021 frenzy. I plan to shift my focus on housing and housing-related real estates to alternative options such as warehouse and storage, tech data centers, and telecommunication infrastructures. With global travel recovering steadily, I may also look at some opportunities in hospitality real estate.

\-Tech: the majority of my loss this year comes from trying to identify “growth” stocks and catch up with market trends, only to be taught by the market to stop doing something I am just not good at. So, tuitions paid, and lessons learned. I plan to stay way for the first quarter of 2023 and only start investing in tech companies exhibiting good fundamentals later.

\-Food and Beverage: Like energy, food supplies are also strained due to geopolitical concerns, but contrary to energy, a raw material shortage is no great news for food and beverage businesses. With this amount of ambiguity, I would be extra careful in this sector trying to identify what companies could best weather through the supply shortage.

\-Precious Metal: Since 2018 I’ve been buying both physical gold and silver and ETFs of gold and silver. They may not be the best performing hedge or alternative investment options in 2022, but they are still some of the most easily accessible for individual investors like myself, and their price hike in the past few years also make up with some of my losses this year. I will keep regularly investing a dedicated amount of cash into precious metal.

\-Bonds/Debts: I have to say I am not knowledgeable in this sector. I do hold mixed bond ETFs (performing roughly the same as my entire portfolio), and I’ve heard recommendations on investment-grade bonds and municipal bonds (munies), but I did not do much homework on them. Any suggestions are welcome.

\-High-yield Savings Account: I put whatever emergency and surplus cash in several high-yield savings accounts, and they have been able to generate enough interests to cover at least my grocery spending every week. It’s always good to earn a few extra bucks on idle cash. Since I do not see a rate slash soon, I will keep saving into these accounts.

That would save me 15% if I were to sell this stock later in life when we were in the 15% tax bracket for LTCG.

But this would also mean I'd have to pay ~3% state taxes on that amount, so about $1,200. That $1,200 could instead stay in the stock market for many years and after about 30 years (when I'm 82), its growth will actually be more than the 15% savings on my federal taxes.

personalfinance,Paychecks when filing as Married,"Hey All,

I recently got married and was curious if my paystubs will change when being married. I have been using [https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator](https://www.paycheckcity.com/calculator) to calculate my paychecks and it has been pretty accurate so far, with probably a \~$20-$100 difference.

When I change my federal taxes from ""single or married filing separately"" -&gt; ""married filing jointly,"" my paychecks will increase by about $200.

From my understanding that for federal taxes, if you select married filing jointly, doesn't this assume that I am the only person working which is why less taxes are taken out of my paychecks?

To put this into perspective, I make significantly more than my spouse, if I go with that route to get a little extra on my paychecks would I run the risk of owing money on tax season? We will also be filing jointly during tax season.

I'd rather have the most taxes taken out now so that when tax season comes, I do not have to worry about owing money.",finance,1672347797

personalfinance,Best way to tackle CC debt?,"Long story short, I have horrible spending habits and am now suffering the consequences and trying to turn my financial habits around. 

I’ve maxed my credit card at $10,500 at 22 years old. I’ve spent the last few years eating out whenever a friend asked, buying whatever clothes were in style, going WAY overboard on Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, just because gifts… I’ve cut out all unnecessary spending and have basically been giving myself the bare minimum trying to pay off my card. Whenever I think I’m getting ahead, the interest is tacked on and I feel like I’m right back where I started. 

I just started a new job with really good benefits, but because of the great benefits my salary is lower. I take home roughly $2500 a month, sometimes more depending on how much overtime I get. Also get occasional bonuses, raises throughout the year (I’ve only been here three months and have already gotten two raises).

My credit card balance is currently $10,360.34 with an interest rate of 26.74%. I literally feel like I’m drowning and I’m so ashamed and embarrassed to even let anyone in my life know.

-$500 rent
-$450 car payment 
-$350 CC payment 
-$300 groceries

The good news is that I just got a year end bonus totaling $2,000 which I put 100% to my card (which now I’m not sure if I should have used all of it for that) so my balance will be down to $8,360.34.

The stock market had its worst day of the year after the August consumer price index report showed inflation running hotter than expected, at 8.3% year-over-year compared to expectations of 8.0%.

  **2. May 18 - S&amp;P 500 down 4.0%** 

A big earnings miss from Target highlighted shifts in consumer spending patterns, supply chain issues, and rising input costs. This was just one day after Walmart warned investors about the same issues. Target closed down 25% that day.

**3. June 13 - S&amp;P 500 down 3.9%**

The May CPI report showed inflation running hotter than expected, at 8.6% year-over-year compared to expectations of 8.3%. This day threw the S&amp;P 500 into bear market territory for the first time in 2022, with the index down 21.8% from its January 3 highs.

A big first-quarter earnings miss from Amazon, combined with reduced guidance, sent the market reeling and pushed Amazon stock down 14%, its worst one-day decline since 2006. The sell-off sent other mega-cap tech stocks spiraling downwards as well.

The stock market reversed sharply lower, giving back the prior day's massive gain that was sparked by Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remark that policymakers weren't considering interest rate hikes of more than 50 basis points.

personalfinance,Put money into Roth or into a high-yield savings account?,"I have 60k in liquid cash currently and I'm 26, I've been thinking of moving my money to a bank that offers a higher yield on interest rates. Currently, interest for some savings accounts (3%+) is higher than for some CDs, etc. My current bank's interest rates on savings are shit ( 0.0015% ). I've been hesitant about switching banks because I'm scared that the funds will be lost and if its the right choice. I've been speaking to one of my wealth advisors ( free consultation ) at my bank about my situation.

His opinion is that it's pointless to move banks as I shouldn't have that much liquid cash anyways. He thinks that I should max a Roth and move all but 10-20k into the market instead of worrying about short-term interest rates on high savings. His opinion may be biased but I can understand his standpoint. I plan to buy another house in a year or so, if I'm going to use most of my savings on a big purchase then there's no point in worrying about interest rates on saving because the less you have the more negligible your interest gains are.

My problem is that I can't predict how much money I'll need in the future and I don't want my money looked up in a Roth. I already have a 401k currently. My idea is to change banks and use the money I would gain off interest ( probably $200 a month looking at most banks' APY ) and use that money to deposit into the Roth and keep the rest of my cash liquid. So basically I would ( if interest rates stay high ) get a free $2400 to deposit into a Roth yearly.

**Things I learned this year**

1. Interest rates! I would have worked harder to find another solution than to take out a HELOC for the purchase of a new house in 2021. The interest rate was low, but variable. Grateful to at least be in a position to take care of this quickly.
2. Career wise, I jumped off a sinking ship in April to join a growth stage startup. Got a bump in base salary but lost the big tech bonus (\~$30K). The markets corrected, so my startup went through 2 layoffs. My equity in the startup is paper money, we’ll see if maybe it’s worth anything one day. Overall I took a paycut to bet on startup equity, while last year’s TC was \~$300K from a public company. If I’m being honest with myself I had some self doubt about whether I could “make it” in the startup world but now know I can excel in this type of company. I want to head back to a bigger company again that can support my growth and continue to build a reputation in my field. I can likely increase my liquid compensation by about $75-100K this way.
3. Simplify… our expense tracking and budgeting had grown out of control this year, across so many new categories. I’ve rearranged the categories to be more simple and give clarity to our situation.
4. Do a financial check up and ensure our money is going where we want it too. Things got chaotic between so many jobs this year, but our expenses were consistent and regular. My partner changed jobs twice. I changed jobs once. In 2022, the financial goals were less clear and we got busy balancing full time careers and being parents. We need to ensure in 2023 we’re completely maxing out our retirement accounts. Plenty to focus on here in 2023.

There’s a lot of room to improve as we manage lifestyle inflation and settle into our lives as parents. Next year my partner will be getting a raise that is on pace with inflation, and it will be my goal to increase income in order to increase our savings rate. I would love to hear from other parents with young families who want to FIRE, and how you balance what seem like competing needs.",finance,1672351058

After my income doubled, I don't know why, I guess I thought that I could handle it, but I signed up a couple installment loans here and there totaling around $300 a month paid on the first of each month which brings my income back down to $300 a month which I used to enjoy just fine.

I started regretting taking out these loans when I got to thinking about how I can be the proud owner of the latest and greatest electronics at any point in my lifetime while I have a limited time with my parents who are 73 years old and aren't getting any younger. I want to go on more vacations with them and split the bills and stuff but these loans are really cutting into what I can put into savings and slowing down what I want out of life now.

I'm trying to reduce my spending but boy, do I get bored at home and I end up breaking down and spending a bunch of money on the last week of the month just to get out of the house.

I suggested selling my big screen TV and PlayStation 5 console before Christmas to mom and she sternly said something about how I love that thing and she doesn't think that it would be a good idea. I can see her point of view. It's a source of entertainment for me and I'd be boring myself further without it.

My income is $600 and my debt is $2,500.

The $1,250 that's on my Affirm loan account I like because it's all upfront like ok, your loan of $700 will be for 18 months, your payments will be $42, and total interest will be $50.

The other $1,250 is on two credit cards. I dislike this. The interest rates are about the same on both but they give me the flexibility to have no discipline and make those $30 minimum payments.

I'm currently testing out dividing my total credit card debt by twelve and setting that as my auto pay minimum payment.

The other bad thing is that my credit card never shuts off. When I get to $300 spend and need to stop for the month, it doesn't alert me or shut my card off. I'm going to set up a card alert tonight.

I also dislike having four different accounts. It would be more convenient to have all of my debts in one place.

personalfinance,Second Home Down Payment,"Hoping to get some advice on our current situation. Due to work circumstances, wife, 2 kids, and I are going to be purchasing a new house in the next 1-6 months. The homes we are looking at are in the 1.2m range, so we are going to need a Jumbo loan. Given the current state of the market, that means putting 20% down despite high income and excellent credit. We have enough cash and assets we can liquidate to get most of the way to the $240K required, but are going to come up short unless we either sell our current house or find a way to finance the gap (likely somewhere between 60-100K). Our current home is located in a highly desirable area with extremely limited inventory and would be easy to sell, but I am hesitant to move on from it as we pay less for our mortgage (with a 2.85% interest rate) than we could earn in rent for the same reasons that make it easy sell. 

A mortgage broker suggested a HELOC to finance the remaining capital needed to cover the down payment, and while I have a general understanding of the concept, I don’t feel educated enough to properly assess the risk/reward. In theory it sounds like it enables the purchase of the new house while retaining our current home as a source of income, but I would really appreciate some perspective from folks more knowledgeable than I am. Is this a reasonable solution to the problem at hand or is it unwise/risky?

personalfinance,"With interest rates set to go higher, hypothetically is there a point where a savings account makes more sense than to invest in the markets.","Hello all, I have 10k in my emergency fund  
7k in a 4% HYSA
3k in a 4.85% CD

And currently have about 80k invested in broad market ETFs. I was always just stash some money here and there and completely ignore wether it went down or up. I’ve always read that getting at least 7% return over the long term will eventually get me to my goals.

Now, if the fed continues to raise rates and banks get to a point where they can pay 7%-8% interest for cash. Would it make sense to pull my invested funds into a cd/interest bearing account instead of in the markets exposing it to all the turbulence that comes with it.

Just looking for some insights thanks in advance! 😄",finance,1672369417

deeplearning,A new technology benchmark from our Image Segmentation model!,"We're excited to share our latest technology benchmark in Image Segmentation. With just only 4 training data points, and 53 seconds of training, our model was able to converge with high accuracy on dataset fed. This is possible thanks to our research in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation and Few-Shot Learning.

As shown in the comparison below, our model was able to outperform OneFormer when trained on same data (COCO-20i). The benefit for using our model includes faster training (more than 10x) and reduced data.

We are currently looking for beta users (Free!). Simply leave a comment below or PM me if you're interested. Don't miss this opportunity to revolutionize your image segmentation process!

gaming,RPG related question,"Say you were playing an RPG where you have quite a number of nonhuman races to play as. And as an incentive to unlock them all (as opposed to having them all playable the moment you boot up the game), only several were playable immediately. To be able to play as more races, you need to learn the culture of every race but you can't just waltz into every domain and interacting with every race you come since nearly every race has their enemies. So you'd have to disguise yourself as either that race or one of their allies. And in order to do that, you'd would need to (for lack of a better phrase) acquire a race's DNA to morph as said race. Would you enjoy this incentive to increase the number of playable races and learning about their cultures? Or would you be miffed by the limitation at the start of the game? I'm curious as to everyone's thoughts on this idea.",technology,1672383027

CryptoCurrency,CBDC - FEDNOW Could the Federal Reserve End Cryptocurrency's Key Use Case for Instantaneous Transactions with High Security?,"The Federal Reserve is set to launch a new system in 2023, and one question on the minds of many is whether this system could potentially challenge the use of cryptocurrency for instant and secure transactions. In order to fully understand the potential impact of the Federal Reserve's new system, it is important to first understand the fundamental value of an investment and the difference between fundamentals and intangibles. 

The fundamental qualities of cryptocurrency that make it appealing to investors include decentralization, transparency, censorship resistance, and immutability. These features offer a level of security that traditional financial systems cannot match. Furthermore...

personalfinance,"I ""invested"" 70k into a ""Bausparvertrag""","This year, my SO of 17 years and I split up. She bought my half of our flat. I have about 100k left, after paying my part of the remaining debt.
Right know I am renting a flat. It is very affordable and in the middle of the city center with a parking garage underneath it. I can walk to work from home. So for now I am happy with my flat.

I want to retire as early as possible. This probably means I need an own appartement or house by the age of 62 and it needs to be paid off and in good shape by then. I am 45 now.

So I used 70k of my money now to buy into a ""Bausparkasse"". That means that those 70k are frozen and I make hardly any interest right now. It also means that I can use those 70k in about 3 years to buy property and get a loan of another 70k with an interest rate of 2.5% fixed over about 14 years. So I pay off this loan over those 14 years with less than 500€ per month (net income about 4k/mo, tenured).

I wonder if this is the sensible thing to do. I have about 2 weeks to retreat from this contract. Houses are anywhere from 150k€ to 1 million €, here. 200-300k for what I need and want, realistically.",finance,1672394361

stocks,[12/30] Friday's Pre-Market Stock Movers &amp; News (The final trading day of 2022),"#Good Friday morning traders and investors of the r/stocks sub! Welcome to the final trading day of the year. Here are your pre-market movers &amp; news this AM-

*****

#[Stock futures edge lower as Wall Street awaits final trading day of 2022](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
&gt; Stock futures edged lower in premarket trading Friday as investors braced for the final trading day of the worst year for stocks since 2008.
*****
&gt; Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 130 points, or 0.4%. S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures traded lower by 0.6% and nearly 0.9%, respectively.
*****
&gt; The overnight moves followed a rally Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 climbing about 2.6% and roughly 1.8%, respectively. The Dow jumped 345 points, or 1.05%.
*****
&gt; For the week, the Dow and S&amp;P are slightly higher, with the Nasdaq on track for a modest loss. All major averages are lower for December and are poised to snap a two-month win streak.
*****
&gt; Friday marks the final day of trading of what’s been a painful year for stocks. A volatile bear market, sticky inflation, and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks. These factors also weighed on investor sentiment.
*****
&gt; All three of the major averages are marching toward their worst year since 2008, slated to snap a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down 8.58%, while the S&amp;P and tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 19.24% and 33.03%, respectively.
*****
&gt; As the calendar year turns the corner, some investors think the pain is far from over, and expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows.
*****
&gt; “We’re sort of stuck in neutral right now, because there are more unanswered questions than there are known entities. ... We’ve got a lot riding on this coming earnings season, when we think about the pressures that are going to exist on margins,” Rebecca Felton, senior market strategist at Riverfront Investment Group, said on “Squawk Box.”
*****
&gt; “There are a lot of questions as we head into the new year, but we certainly will be happy to see 2022 go over,” Felton added.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow is on pace for a 15.65% quarterly gain and is primed to snap a three-quarter losing streak. It’s also headed for its best quarter since the second quarter of 2020. The S&amp;P is up 7.35% and slated to break three consecutive quarterly losses. The Nasdaq’s slipped 0.92%, for its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001.
*****
&gt; All major S&amp;P sectors finished Thursday with gains, led to the upside by communication services. For the quarter, consumer discretionary and communication services are the only sectors headed for losses. Energy is the only sector on pace for yearly gains after surging nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; Communication services stocks in the S&amp;P 500 are down more than 40% on the year and consumer discretionary has fallen 37.4%, while energy, the large-cap index’s only positive sector, has soared nearly 58%.
*****
&gt; On the economic front, Chicago PMI data for December is due out Friday. Next week will see a slightly more active slate for economic data, highlighted by the nonfarm payrolls report set for Jan. 6. Financial markets are closed Monday in observance of the New Year’s Day holiday.

I thought the late fees and charges were bs when I found out about it and they were happy to just let me pay the original balance and just close out the account. I didn't understand how much weight that would have on my score.  I went from high 700s to mid 500s. It's now up to 650ish. Is there anything I can do about this 3 year old account?
Every other mark is 100% satisfactory paid on time or paid in full. Personal loans, auto loans, mortgage etc.  I feel like the score is a serious misrepresentation of me as a borrower.  I'm building a house currently and will be refinancing that into a conventional mortgage in about 6 months and interest rates are already ridiculous.  Any advice?",finance,1672413259
personalfinance,My experience recasting my mortgage with WF,"The process was surprisingly simple. I called their mortgage team, and their only requirement was that I paid an extra 20k of principal, either cumulatively or as a lump sum. I have done that, so the next step was for their team to approve me and send documents to sign. Now I'm just waiting on their final sign-off! 

Some notes:

* If you don't know about recasting, and have made/been making extra principal payments for some time, look it up! It's a great way to reduce your monthly mortgage payments without changing the interest rate or the end date of your term. It just takes your remaining principal, divides that into an amortized schedule for the remainder of the loan, and recalculates the interest.

* Note that your increased principal payments mean you are going to pay the house off earlier, but a recast stretches it back out to be paid later. That means that you will pay more interest to the bank than you were on track to do *if and only if* you choose to stick close to the new lower minimum payment. If you keep paying as much principal off the loan as you were doing before the recast, you will still be on track to pay it off earlier.

* Even if you don't care about a lower minimum payment each month, you can still pay the same amount to the lender to be on track to pay it off early, but have the added flexibility of a lower minimum payment if your financial needs change suddenly.

Some notes about my situation and WF:

* I have a 30y fixed-rate mortgage at 3.25%, and we are about 6 years into it. We would be on track to pay off the entire mortgage by 15 years in. Our financial needs changed with kids, so we were looking to capitalize more on our low interest rate with the home and use the difference towards saving for their college funds (529s). We figure we will get better than a 3.25% return there. We will still be making extra principal payments, but less than we have been. 

* Our recast changed our minimum P&amp;I payment from ~1k to ~750. 

* WF said they had no limit on the amount of times we could recast, provided we paid another extra 20k principal, and that recasting was free! Different lenders sometimes require a payment or limit the number of times you can recast, so I was happy that WF had none of those requirements.",finance,1672413855
personalfinance,advice on using 20k settlement?,"i’m currently 47k in student loan debt (19kfederal, 7k institution, rest private through discover) for a degree i wont be finishing— i would finish with 80-90k in debt with a film degree. 

im expecting a 20-25k settlement soon and im wondering what would be the wisest way to use this money? 

im currently planning to enroll in community college for either nursing or a tech degree which would cost 8-10k depending on the program. i’ll probably choose nursing first because that will allow me to have a career in 1.5 years guaranteed and then hopefully switch to tech at some point. 

right now i want to focus on the best financial move since i’ve put myself in so much debt and won’t have a degree to show for it. film is my passion but my family moved out of the country so pursuing an expensive degree with no way to use my connections with no home-base is just too risky for me at this point. i feel awful giving up on my dream right now but i tell myself i can come back to it. 

i want to return to the states to have easier access to work— i have no interest in living abroad, my mom sort of tricked me into coming out here. unless i find online work while abroad i wont have an income. in the states, my only other rent free option is to live with my grandparents in one of the worst cities in america in northern indiana. 

i have crappy mental health that’s only worsened since being out of the country and if i choose to move with my grandparents i’ll be returning to my childhood room where i experienced trauma. just thinking of being in that situation drives me insane and keeps me up at night. whenever i even visit their home i need to sleep on the couch because of how terrible the environment makes me feel so this option would be one of of the worst things i would choose to help myself financially. 

i know it would be more financially wise to live rent free (i also wouldn’t need a car with grandparents) but my fear of being in that house makes me want to put some of the money towards living on my own and trying to flip the rest in some way — investments, trading, starting some kind of business, idk. 

would you invest the money, use the money to get stable, or put it towards the debt? (or some combination of these choices)

my apologies for any information you might find irrelevant, i don’t know what to do and want to set myself up for a better situation than i’m in currently.",finance,1672413879

personalfinance,Buying 2nd home: Use 401k funds or Sell 1st home,"For personal reasons, my family needs to move closer to extended family sooner rather than later. Unfortunately, we are cash poor and would not realistically get a chunk of cash for a down payment anytime soon. We do have two levers to pull, selling our current house or using 401k funds.

Our house is worth ~$550k (according to Zillow) and have ~$400k left on a loan with 2.75% interest rate (this is important for later). It is in the Denver Suburb area which has had a hot housing market and is projected to continue to be hot.

My 401k has ~75K.

Ideally, we would like to keep the first house since it is in a great location plus has good investment potential for both retirement and rent income especially considering the low interest rate. That would mean taking a loan against our 401k. I understand the implications of taking a loan out against our 401k (less job mobility) and taking a withdrawal (penalty fees).

energy,Alex Epstein Fossil Fuels - Does anyone have a better framework than expanding human flourishing?,"I've read both of Alex Epstein's books on fossil fuels, Personally I find his case on the benefits of fossil fuels to be compelling. Mostly the fact that when the benefits and positive/ negative externalities are weighed fossil fuels have a number of significant advantages over other forms of technology. I picked up his book with the belief that Nuclear has the solution to many of the worlds energy woes, I still believe that.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhow I agree with most of his points but mostly take issue with his framework of improving human flourishing. I am not against human flourishing but it presents a strange utilitarian argument where the welfare of humans is the only concern. I want to talk about my concerns with this method of reasoning and I hope you folks can either point out the errors in my way, or help develop a more robust framework that one can use for energy liberation. 

&amp;#x200B;

First the utilitarianism argument is the default position people seem to take on how large issues should be tackled. It may sound good in practice but is incredibly fickle when you dive into it. There are plenty of thought experiments that demonstrate this - a notable one being as a doctor you run an organ transplant clinic and you need 10 different organs that will save the lives of 10 patients, and you have a resident who has also the healthy organs that have been tissue typed for the patients by sacrificing this one healthy resident you can save the lives of 10 sick patients - do you do it? Most people tend to be uncomfortable with this line of reasoning. 

In the United States this reasoning was considered dangerous and argued against in Federalist 10 by James Madison arguing about factions and the protections of having either powerful minorities suppress majorities, or majorities steamroll minorities due to majority rule. 

Second issue is diversity, people have unique viewpoints, wants, and desires and this is difficult to quantify. It is the libertarian reason that the individual is the biggest minority. So this being said it is virtually impossible to decide that there is a primary value/options that people want out of a menu of values/ options. When this deals with multiple variables it is virtually impossible to maximize on this front. Luke smith explains this well:

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

""So the first problem is one any mathematician will realize right off the bat: it's rarely possible to maximize a function for two variables. If we had the means, we could maximize (1) the amount of good in society or (2) the number of people who feel that good, but nearly certainly not both (if we can it's a bizarre coincidence). It's sort of like saying you want to find a house with the highest available altitude and the lowest available price; the highest house might not have the lowest price and vice versa, the same way the way of running society which maximizes happiness is nearly certainly not be the way which maximizes all individuals' happiness.

&amp;#x200B;

There are some classic moral puzzles that bring this out: Let's say there's a city where basically everyone is in absolute ecstasy, but their ecstasy can only take place if one particular person in the city is in intense and indescribable pain. Or to put it another way, to maximize my happiness, we might need to make everyone in the world my slave and allow me to rule as I please. Although this might maximize my happiness, it might not maximize anyone else's (if it does however, we might want to consider it).""

&amp;#x200B;

Alex Epstein believes in the approach of letting private property owners dictate what happens on their land. That this ample protection of private property will in fact lead to massive development that will lead to human flourishing and uses the fact that the empire state building was built in a little more than a year, a 135 mile pipeline was built in 3 months. The issue I have with this approach again is maximizing for values and the differences people want in regard to land usage/ resource extraction

&amp;#x200B;

\-With libertarian ideology public land should be controlled by private entities - BLM, NPS, Forest Service, and private entities do a better job at management - preservation, balancing resource extraction, balancing the needs of the public and industry while also preventing negligence on behalf of the government (bad wildfire management practices).  An example of this is the Nature Conservancy who have lands in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Tennessee, and California including a number of other states. In my opinion the Nature Conservancy does a great job but it is rare to find private companies who do this I know thousands of acres of forest in Nova Scotia, The Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and the Pacific Northwest which are inaccessible to the public and cordoned off as they are controlled by logging companies who use the land exclusively for timber. Texas is often championed as a model where the vast majority of land is private and resources are exploited well. The trouble with Texas is if you value the outdoors public lands provide vast opportunities to recreation which are almost non-existent in Texas. This is why so much of the American West, and Canadian West are considered desirable places to live is due to the outdoor recreation opportunities. 

&amp;#x200B;

 \-The issue with fossil fuel/ mineral exploitation is it is often a zero-sum game. I've lived in Appalachia and in the Western United States where I worked in the mining industry. There are plenty of examples of outstanding mining practices, but there are also horrific examples that occurred with older frameworks.

&amp;#x200B;

In Appalachia you have Little Blue Run Lake a toxic lake of coal slurry, that constantly pollutes water supplies. Appalachia built much of the US. During WWII the men got exemptions from the draft because coal was such a valuable natural resource as it powered the steel mills and led the US to becoming an industrial power to be successful in the war. The industry coal powered went to areas more appropriate to manufacturing - great lakes region which had access to great lakes/ river transport, the sunbelt region. But there was a massive asymmetry in development. Big towns in this region such as Harlan were company towns and when the company left they destroyed much of the infrastructure, hotels, employee housing. The region lags behind the US for a number of reasons but a major one is much of the profits generated from the mining don't go to the people or region (they most get wage/ infrastructure improvements) -product is exported and most of the profit is centralized in areas where the mining headquarters are - Atlanta, GA, Charlotte, NC. This isn't an isolated instance - you can look at the Berkeley Pit in Montana One of the world's largest superfund sites - these are difficult to clean up and liability to clean them is difficult due to the LLCs the companies employ. Jared Diamond calls this rape and run. Anyhow resource development is asymmetrical - if it is uranium mining in the Wind Rivers, or Navajo nation, or oil refineries in Cancer alley. This is only some of what exists in North America the bulk of this is in the developing world. He seems to address it by advocating for local standards of pollution, but again the issue is this is dictated by mining companies as opposed to the people who live in the area (people want mining jobs -not environmental degradation that comes with it). There has to be a way to address this so more nature is protected, while taking into account diverse viewpoints - Greatest human flourishing = mountain top removal in these areas as the worlds' population outweighs that of Appalachia. 

&amp;#x200B;

Epstein doesn't address how these problems would be dealt with, if anything they'd be made worse. The closest thing I can find in his work is something akin to Neil Postman's technological fallacy. That these problems will occur, but with the boom in human technology these problems will be addressed. I.e. small modular reactors will be cheap to install on reservations, in Appalachia, and at Superfund sites to clean up the messes of the past and what will be made in the present. Similar to Neil Postman/ Ted Kaczynski - New technology isn't weighed/ evaluated for negative externalities it is just released on the public, and new technology is supposed to make up for the shortcomings/ shortfalls of prior technology but ends up creating problems of it's own. 

&amp;#x200B;

lastly human primacy utilitarianism under the framework that Epstein advocates It would be permissible to destroy a resource If it leads to greater human flourishing at large. I've gone on way too long with everything else but I'll keep this short and just use animals as an example. The extinction of species is permissible if it leads to greater human flourishing. He talks about the permissibility of animal testing because of the benefits it offers humans. That may be fine but a major issue I have is a Talebian one - we as humans are terrible at evaluating complexity with wild species there are a number of ecological services provided by plants/ animals that we don't yet understand/ can't quantify. There isn't a framework he puts forward for this but I assume it would be in the realm of the proliferation of cheap/ abundant energy will deal with this later. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are plenty of examples of exploitation in the name of Human flourishing leading to extinctions. 

&amp;#x200B;

\- Extinction of passenger pigeon in the name of food/ nuisance control

&amp;#x200B;

\-Extinction of Tasmanian wolf -nuisance control

&amp;#x200B;

\- Functional extinction of Baiji (Chinese Freshwater Dolphin) Due to development of Three Gorges Dam. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Near extinction of Bison - first overhunting of first nations, and later settlers using bison for pelts, meat, and fertilizer. 

1830s Estimated 30-60 million bison in North America - mass hunting begins

1870 - 2 million killed in one year southern plains alone

1884 - 325 wild bison left

1910 - conservation brings number to 1,000

2017 - over 500,000 bison in North America. 

&amp;#x200B;

In recent news, we've heard that SBF met with White House officials only 2 months before FTX imploded, and ""politics were not discussed"". SBF donated $100M+ to Democrats and $20M to Republicans.  SBF also met with Fed officials, Tony Blair, Bill Clinton, Maxine Waters, and hundreds of other billionaire elites. SBF hired former US government regulators to monitor FTX finances and pipeline approvals at the SEC and CFTC.  Sam even met with Gary Gensler, the head of the SEC, which is the financial body tasked with regulating crypto markets (it didn't matter at all that SBF's dad had taught Gensler at Harvard). SBF was the MOST vocal advocate of crypto regulation on the Internet, in fact only a few weeks before FTX went kablooie he proposed what was basically a total government takeover of all crypto markets. 

Now we know that FTX was a complete fraud from day one, yet somehow we're to believe that not one  government regulator, lawmaker, judge, president, financial executive, or lay person with a shred of common sense knew this. The MOST REGULATED crypto exchange in the world was the MOST CORRUPT. This is because ""regulators"" don't actually do anything other than occasionally prosecute someone who didn't pay off the government.  Do you notice how Citadel illegally front-runs stock trades, JP Morgan illegally rigs precious metals prices, HSBC launders billions for drug cartels, and Goldman Sachs is generally a vampire squid on the entire world's economy, yet these blatant crimes are never prosecuted?   **FTX is the latest in a long line of pay-to-play financial scams, which had the explicit backing of the US government.  ""Regulation"" of crypto markets will only corrupt them further.**

You are running their software. That is all you are doing when you join a pool. You agree to **their terms and conditions*. You are joining a pool or a node.

&gt; What you don't understand is the fact that if the gov came to shut down or control a pool( even tho they would literally gain nothing from doing so) poeple would see this and immediately leave the pool and join another.

The government would ""control"" a pool to seize (stolen) coins. A node is in the business to make money, not fight government. Nodes have invested millions of dollars into hardware. Just because some schmuck in his moms basement leaves a pool, nobody will fucking care. The big guys dont have your mentality. They want to make money. They will obey. Like I said, email Mike if you dont believe me ;)

Dude, you are running a damn laptop from your moms basement. No one fucking cares if you leave a pool. 

&gt; Nothing is stopping anyone from doing so and even if the police handcuffed the ceo of one of these pools and said "" give me all the hashpower"" they literally cannot stop poeple from pulling out because they don't control everyone's hashpower. If the police even considered doing something so dumb, that pool would be emptier faster than you can say I don't understand what I'm talking about.

The pool would obey, you'd continue running their software. Again, a node is there to make money, not be anarchists or fight the government. 

&gt; These pools cannot re-write or take away ANY transactions without a re org of the Blockchain. You seriously don't understand what you are talking about. Once it's in the Blockchain and validated, there is no way to un do that transaction....

Miners wouldn't ""undo"" a tx. They would simply accredit an address with x number of coins, and discredit the address the coins came from. The history would remain on the blockchain. 

&gt; Now once again, and don't ignore this question this time. What's the difference between a Bitcoin miner and a Bitcoin node.

The definition of a node is in the whitepaper: 

&gt; The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers.

personalfinance,Does it make sense to max out 60k/year in 401k just to use for house downpayment?,"I am able to put up to 60k into a 401k with my C2C payments, 40k would be tax advantaged from the employer side and 20k from my gross wage. 40k as in not employer match but I would be paying for it - like how people on 1099 can put 60k/year into 401k. The 40k is from my ""salary"" but even less taxes than  from gross wage. 

I want to buy a house in a year or two and I wasn't putting more than 20k/year into the 401k because I was keeping all savings liquid for the downpayment. But now that interest rates are going up I'm wondering if I should max out the 401k for the sole purpose of containing my downpayment funds. The main advantage is that I am taxed at about 38% total income tax right now so I'd be able to save a significant amount extra in the 401k as opposed to cash. I am working a lot right now and intend to reduce my hours and thus income after the house purchase so I won't be taxed as much in the future.

Then I would use a loan against myself when the time came to buy so I would be repaying the loan with interest, but the interest would go to me. The 401k comes through a service provider that I pay a fee to run my payroll so I don't think I have the normal issue of needing to pay it all back with sudden termination.

One part that confused me when I read about the pros and cons online is that they said if someone does this they cannot contribute to the 401k until the loan is paid off and they are missing significant compound interest/losing years of contributions while they are repaying it. I don't understand why this is a big deal if I am assuming compound interest is at 6% but the mortgage rates are 7.5% now. Aren't I still saving more when factoring in compound interest?

&amp;#x200B;

Say my primary goal is to get the house then next goal is to save for retirement. If I get paid 60k, if I pay it out in gross wage I'll get maybe 35-40k cash but if I put it into my 401k I can put 55k in there that I can still be using for downpayment and put future savings towards the loan. It seems like a no brainer to me but there must be a catch?",finance,1672440785

stocks,2023 Outlook: Your thoughts?,"**The Strategy**

My strategy is based upon a concentrated value investing approach. I like to perform deep fundamental research to find and buy a stake in companies that I find value in. I like to hold 12 to 15 stocks diversified among various industries to diversify against any black swan events. This strategy offers my portfolio enough downside protection while also leaving enough room for my best ideas to play out. I protect the portfolio from serious losses by performing deep fundamental research and by using a margin of safety, not by avoiding or minimizing volatility. I see stocks as parts of businesses and analyze and value them according to that principle. This includes both buying low and buying the companies with a high discount to their intrinsic value. When you minimize losses and allocate capital when the odds are in your favor, you don’t lose and when you win, you win big. That is the backbone of a concentrated value approach.

I do not hold restrictions on portfolio management and can allocate a larger part of my portfolio to one or several stocks. I furthermore do not yield any restrictions to potential investments. Such restrictions harm the ability to invest freely and to fully deploy my strategy and can even diminish performance. This includes market caps, industries, ESG restrictions, portfolio sizes, number of stocks and country of origin. I hold 12-15 stocks because I like it that way, it leaves enough room for opportunities while making sure you deeply understand both your investments and your entire portfolio. I allocate capital based upon a risk/reward scenario whereas all positions (and sizes) are constructed according to that principle. If the numbers are simply too good, I may allocate more capital to that opportunity, certainly if the risk is contained or minimized towards the downside. 

**Volatility**

Basic mathematical principles tell us that to maximize our upside returns, firstly we need to minimize the downside as lost dollars are harder to replace (i.e. a 33% drop needs a 50% gain to breakeven). I do not hedge the portfolio with various instruments as hedging is surrendering towards the idea that you are unsure about your portfolio and individual positions. I hold securities and maintain a decent cash position to allocate capital to various opportunities presented by the market without the need to sell off other positions. Trying to avoid losses is done by deeply fundamental research and buying stocks cheaply and not by hedging your uncertain positions by buying various financial instruments. One could argue that buying dollar bills for 50 cents and therefore stocks that are cheaply priced towards their intrinsic value is all the hedging an equity portfolio requires.

I do not think that volatility is related to risk or risk of losses and the portfolio is therefore not constructed to minimize volatility. Each investor should understand that a concentrated value approach yields an above average high level of volatility and should not confuse volatility with risk (as is common in modern day finance). Again, risk is minimized not through building statistical models regarding volatility but rather through respectful and deep business evaluation and research. Traditional risk management considers beta, also known as market risk, as a measure of volatility or systematic risk of an individual stock in comparison to the entire market. According to that idea, risk management would therefore be appropriate to diversify in a lot of stocks to smooth out volatility and still be rewarded with an appropriate return. If you include enough stocks to eventually resemble the index volatility, then your returns will eventually resemble the index that you are so desperately trying to beat and doom yourself to mediocre performance. Deep business evaluation and research is ought to be useless as the efficient market assigns the correct values to all businesses. The entire finance industry operates mainly to the same models and therefore increases the volatility and opportunities presented by the market, so volatility can also be a tool to buy a good stock for a high discount relative to its intrinsic value.

**Warren Buffet:** ""The riskiness of an investment is not measured by beta (a Wall Street term encompassing volatility and often used in measuring risk) but rather by the probability of that investment causing its owner a loss of purchasing power over his contemplated holding period. Assets can fluctuate greatly in price and not be risky as long as they are reasonably certain to deliver increased purchasing power over their holding period."" (2011)

**The Portfolio**

I try to stay away from the most popular stock in the most popular industry. I do not assign any indicative value towards securities other than the value I find in them by performing deep fundamental research. I do not allocate capital towards businesses simply because they are popular, well-known, would make the portfolio look great on paper or are fun to talk about on your nephew’s birthday party. Peter Lynch prefers to avoid the hottest stock in the hottest industry; stocks that are heralded as the next big something; longshot companies at the cusp of solving the latest national problem; and stocks with the most exciting name. He also dislikes whisper stocks that attract imaginative, complicated, and emotionally appealing stories. Stocks that receive significant positive attention have greater risk of being over-bought and over-priced. High growth businesses in popular industries with low barrier to entry attracts a lot of competition and imitation. I tend to agree with him.

To the contrary, my strategy may well be exactly the opposite: I try to find beaten down unpopular undervalued stocks in disfavored industries. For these stocks the downward risk most of the times already happened, there is high emotion involved and some stories are not fully understood. These turnaround stories also have the highest potential for increases in returns. I focus on companies based upon EV/EBITDA ratio since I believe that to be a better measure of profitability and the value assigned to a company. I furthermore focus on free cash flow as that provides businesses opportunities to deploy their capital and achieve shareholder returns. I like companies that are buying back shares and have management that is shareholder friendly oriented. I furthermore like ''rare bird'' stocks that offer special stories and opportunities such as spinoffs, asset plays, arbitrage opportunities and turnarounds because of the asymmetric risk/reward ratio involved. Some companies are so cheaply priced that there seems almost no further downside risk to that specific scenario. I furthermore like companies with recent catalysts that would make it hard to analyze and value the company correctly such as mergers, scandals or trouble, therefore creating opportunities for the observant investor. I calculate and adjust the financial statements to recent situations to derive at my fair value of the company which most of the time is not in line with the price attached to the company by the market.  

I hold my positions for the long term if the fundamentals of the stock stay the same or improve. I sell when my profit target (value) is reached. Although my potential profit could be higher when I hold on just a little longer, in the entire history of humanity, no one has ever gone broke taking profits. If the company does change fundamentally or they don’t show good prospects, I close the position and look for new opportunities. Investing requires both ‘’science and art’’ from the individual investor to form his qualified opinion and specific investment actions. The more qualitative ‘art’ of investing is hard to explicitly state on paper and although I love to elaborate further about the portfolio selection criteria, I think those are best explained below by the current holdings in our portfolio.

**2023 Outlook**

The past year saw a moderate decline in stock prices and the market decline has created greater opportunities among undervalued situations with positive long-term outlook for potential returns. I specifically use the word ‘moderate’ since casual reading of recent media outlets would suggest that the decline is much greater. One could argue to be ‘greedy when others are fearful’ as we saw a lot of fear in the market in the past year. This does not, however, suggest that the market is unable to decline more and create both further investment losses and bargain situations in the stock market. As I do not attempt to forecast stock prices in the short or medium term, I have no idea whether broad market indexes will rise, fall or go sideways for the upcoming year, period or decade. Although past performance is no guarantee for future results, it is a rather useful indicator because the one constant in financial markets is human nature and human nature can be highly emotional, volatile and irrational. If you would compare the 2022 bear market with historical bear markets this would suggest more pain ahead but then again the economic situation and outlook may well be different from those economic situations in the past that accompanied historic market drawdowns.

I do think that the short-term outlook is rather negative across financial markets and that such negative outlooks in the past have been good moments for opportunities in the markets. I furthermore think that our portfolio is well suited for potential long-term returns and potential short-term volatility.  We hold a decent cash allocation in the portfolio to buy a) any of the undervalued opportunities Mr. Market presents to us or b) to increase our positions in our current holdings. 

I do not pretend to be able to predict market movements in the short-term and would feel that any energy used in this endeavor would take energy away from my main tasks. I rather spend my energy looking at the investment opportunities not the condition of the general market itself. That will be our 2023 strategy. Please consider that our concentrated equity portfolio is one of high volatility and act accordingly. I personally have invested a large part of my net worth in the Fund and I hold no other equity securities. My entire professional focus is in this Eurykleia Fund and I therefore believe our goals and returns to be aligned. 

**Our Current Portfolio**

Our portfolio currently consists of 12 marketable securities that are discussed in more detail individually below. I believe all holdings to be undervalued and for that reason have included them in the portfolio. Traditional risk management would suggest that our portfolio contains a high level of risk since it is not diversified into many stocks. In fact, traditional risk management is right in the fact that this portfolio has a high level of market volatility but is wrong in assuming that volatility is in any way related to risk. I do not include company A because I also hold company B and consequently pretend that that addition to the portfolio would in any way decrease the portfolio risk of serious investment losses. To the contrary, adding various random businesses without the deep fundamental research required upfront just for the sake of ‘diversification’ would only worsen the portfolio outlook and increase the risk of serious losses. 

The portfolio is structured and prepared for a wide variety of potential economic situations in the upcoming year. All of our holdings are cash flow generating businesses that generate a high stream of free cash flow and do not depend upon the interest rates dictated by central banks for their growth and survival. We hold 15% of our portfolio in cash to take advantage of opportunities provided to us by the market. 

We have allocated 25% of our capital to **Brookfield Corporation** and **Brookfield Asset Management** since there is value to be found in both businesses due to their recent spinoff of the asset manager. We hold 16% of our portfolio in two oil and gas producers (**Ovintiv** and **Diamondback Energy**) as the low allocation of capital in the industry and the shareholder friendly attitude of management provides opportunities for the coming period. We have furthermore some exposures to retail businesses that may be impacted by a dooming recession but a) these businesses together make up only 15% of the portfolio and b) these businesses are priced so cheaply that they are priced for a suggested bankruptcy instead of a potential recession.

**Brookfield Corporation (14.86%)**

Brookfield is a Canadian alternative asset manager that currently has over $750 billion assets under management across real estate, infrastructure, renewable power and transition, private equity, and credit. Brookfield furthermore holds equity investments in both their own investment funds and subsidiary businesses of $35 billion as well as a sizeable amount of $125 billion cash that can be deployed in their funds and the markets. They have grown their funds from operations annually by 15%. The recent downturn in the market means that they both must adjust the fair value of their investments to market prices and have more cheaper opportunities to deploy their vast amount of capital. More recently, they have distributed 25% of their asset management businesses towards shareholders in a recent spinoff. The Corporation, post spinoff, will own circa $150 billion of private and listed investments, including a 75% interest in the newly listed Manager. 

Brookfield is known for building high growing businesses from scratch and eventually deploying them on the equity markets. They have done so successfully with their asset manager. Currently they are already building their next high profitable and strongly growing business: Brookfield Insurance Solutions which contributed with increased earnings to the distributable earnings that have grown by 39%. By holding our shares in the corporation, we own a claim on the profits received from all businesses owned by the corporation and we participate in the growth of all underlying businesses as well (such as the insurance solutions).

**Brookfield Asset Management (10.72%)**

Brookfield Asset Management has recently spinoff from Brookfield Corporation and is therefore a rather new company.  The manager earnings are based on the fees they receive on their invested capital as well as their portion fees of the investment profits (carried interest). The manager has grown their fee bearing capital from $141 billion in 2018 towards $407 billion in 2022 and AUM has grown by 19% YoY, or $66 billion. Their fee-related earnings have therefore also grown from $823 million in 2018 towards $2 billion in 2022 and have grown 21% YoY, or $352 million. 83% of their fee-bearing capital is long-dated or perpetual. Currently the manager is expected to pay a quarterly (annual) dividend of $0.32 ($1.28) which amounts to a dividend yield of 4.5%. Management furthermore expects their earnings to double in 2027 and to pay 90% of their earnings as a dividend. This means that in 5 years’ time at the current market price the dividend yield would be 9% as well as their earnings to double. Furthermore, the asset manager is able to buy investments at cheap prices and can demand bargain deals for private equity deals. Please notice that the corporation holds 75% of the shares of the manager and therefore receives a $1.37 billion dividend in 2022 alone, or 2.66% of their market cap of $51 billion (the corporation). We own the asset manager because we want to profit from our stake in a highly growing business that has successfully shown in the past that they are able to even outperform their own estimations.

**Ovintiv (9.40%)**

Ovintiv Inc. is a Canadian energy company that is engaged in the exploration, development, and production of oil and natural gas. The company is focused on unconventional oil and natural gas resources, including shale, tight oil, and tight gas. Ovintiv is one of the largest oil and natural gas producers in Canada and is also active in the Permian Basin in the United States. The company certainly looks undervalued with an EV/EBITDA ratio of 3.19, a free cash flow yield of 14.5% and return on equity of 71.25%. The company has focused on paying down debt and returning capital to shareholders. They have decreased their net debt from $4.6 billion to $3.6 billion in 2022 and have the approval to buyback 25 million shares (or 10% of their shares outstanding). Investors might stay away from oil companies because of the fear of a recession and the accompanying drop in oil prices, but even when oil prices drop to crude at $65, the company guides to free cash flow generation of $11B over the next 5 years. In other words, there’s a good shot the company will return nearly its entire market cap to shareholders over the next 5 years.

**Qurate Retail Group (8.08%)**

Qurate Retail Group is a multinational company that owns and operates several retail brands, including QVC, HSN, Zulily, and Ballard Designs. The company is known for its focus on home shopping and e-commerce and Qurate Retail Group's brands offer a wide range of products, including apparel, home goods, beauty products, and electronics. YTD the stock dropped 78.89% towards a market cap of $652 million with a 10-year average of $1 billion free cash flow. Several negative issues such as a fire in a distribution facility, decreasing revenue, a high annual loss and recession fears have pushed the expectation of future profitability towards new low levels. The company, however, is paying down debt at an increasing rate and could buyback their debt on a discount due to rising interest rates. Furthermore, if the company can even come close to their average of $1 billion free cash flow, they can buyback their stock and retire nearly their entire market cap in one year. Since the stock has decreased significantly, it now offers a high margin of safety and a high upside opportunity. The company is currently valued at bankruptcy levels. If the company is able to only use a $100 million of free cash flow to buy back their own stock, they can retire 15% of their outstanding shares. Qurate Retail could be one of those rare turnaround opportunities that provide limited further downside risk and substantial potential upside returns.

**Geo Group (7.09%)**

The GEO Group, Inc. is an American multinational corporation that provides government-outsourced services, primarily in the field of corrections, detention, and mental health treatment. The company was founded in 1984 and is headquartered in Boca Raton, Florida. The GEO Group operates detention centers, prisons, and mental health facilities in the United States, Australia, South Africa, and the United Kingdom. The company contracts with various government agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and state and local governments. Due to the government contracts that have a retention rate of 91%, the revenues and cash flows are highly constant and predictable. The company is furthermore paying of their debt and has a highly growing electronic monitoring business unit that has grown by 74% in the past year. The Geo Group is a real estate owner that records all their PPE at ‘at cost basis’ and therefore highly understates their balance sheet assets which consists for 50% of buildings. The company is growing their revenue and margins and has access to 82.000 correction beds across 102 facilities; The beds are currently valued as if the facilities are idle but the beds have an occupation rate of 85%. The Geo Group seems the perfect value play for the coming year since there is little downside risk of serious losses and there are several positive catalysts coming together.

**Diamondback Energy (6.62%)**

Diamondback Energy, Inc. is a publicly traded American oil and natural gas exploration and production company. It is headquartered in Midland, Texas and is focused on the acquisition, development, and exploration of unconventional oil and natural gas resources in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The company was founded in 2007 and went public in 2012. Diamondback Energy is one of the largest independent oil and natural gas producers in the Permian Basin and is known for its focus on using advanced technology and data analytics to optimize its operations. With a dividend yield of 6.56%, an EV/EBITDA ratio of 4.19 and a free cash flow yield of 13% the company seems highly undervalued. The general investment thesis surrounding oil companies is comparable to that of Ovintiv but Diamondback Energy carries less debt than Ovintiv, adds geographic diversification of revenues and is focused on improving free cash flows by performing strategic acquisitions. The acquisitions can be highly rewardable due to the low values of the industry assets and businesses. As long as oil prices remain elevated, so also the share price of Diamondback Energy.

**Activision Blizzard (5.86%)**

Microsoft has offered to buy Activision Blizzard for $95 per share in a transaction that is expected to complete in June 2023. With the current share price of $76 this amounts to a potential 25% return in 6 months. Although we believe that the deal will go through there is always uncertainty with arbitrage opportunities and we therefore have allocated only 5% of our portfolio towards this arbitrage play. We furthermore believe the downside risk to be minimal which contributes to the investment thesis.

**Warner Bros. Discovery (5.11%)**

Warner Bros. is down from a share price of $31 towards a current share price of $9.40, or a 70% decrease in price YTD. The company is struggling with the recent merger between Warner Bros. and Discovery and incurs high merger costs as well as depreciation and amortization that have been a downward pressure on its profitability. Investors are worried about the seemingly high amount of $47 billion debt. The company, however, has shown strong cash flows and is able to pay off their debt on a discount due to recent rising interest rates. For example, in the past two quarters the company paid off $6 billion of their debt with their cash flows. The CEO has great experience in the media industry and with turning around a media company. Although there are several problems within Warner Bros. Discovery, we believe the pessimism to be overstated and we expect a turnaround when the company can control their merger costs and regain profitability.

**F&amp;G Annuities &amp; Life (4.79%)**

F&amp;G is a nationwide market leader for insurance solutions to retail annuity and life customers and institutional clients. The company has recently spinoff from parent company Fidelity National Financial and currently has a market cap of $380 million and a 4% dividend yield. They have grown their assets under management by 21% YoY towards $42 billion (which were $28.6 billion in 2020). The U.S. retirement and middle markets are growing, and F&amp;G is well-positioned for continued growth in their retail and institutional channels. F&amp;G has diverse product lines and have grown revenue with significant above industry growth numbers (sales grown 15% YoY). Recently, F&amp;G reached an inflection point where they expect to start distributing a portion of their adjusted net earnings to shareholders over time, subject to F&amp;G board of directors’ approval. YTD Q3 their net income was $581 million and their adjusted net earnings were $207 million. For the past 9 quarters, they managed to earn $100 million adjusted net earnings. Given the fact that F&amp;G has grown by double digits in the past years and recently diversified into new revenue streams and has a market cap of only $380 million we highly think that the stock is undervalued.

**Stellantis NV (4.23%)**

Stellantis is the parent company of various auto brands such as Alfa Romeo, Chrysler, Citroën, Dodge, DS, Fiat, Fiat Professional, Jeep, Lancia and Maserati. As the stock is not listed in the USA, the company only reports semiannually. The stock has dropped 35% from their high in 2022 due to recession fears and the broader market decline. Although the recession fear may be correct, it seems that Stellantis is punished before it has even committed a crime. With $50 billion in cash holdings and a market cap of $45 billion, the stock holds more cash per share than the current market price. The company has furthermore fully accelerated their EV strategy and has a broad diversified group of global customers. In the short term their earnings may of course deteriorate due to a recession but with an EV/EBITDA of 0.97 and cash flow yield of 48% it looks like the company is currently priced for a potential bankruptcy instead of a recession.

**Hewlett Packard (3.66%)**

Hewlett Packard (HP) is a technology company that offers a range of products and services, including personal computers, printers, software, and hardware. The company was founded in 1939 and has become a global leader in the technology industry. In recent years, the company has faced challenges as the technology industry has evolved and has undergone several major restructuring efforts to adapt to changing market conditions. HP has a strong free cash flow yield of 14% and has returned significant capital to shareholders. The company has returned $4 billion towards shareholders by share buybacks in 2022 and have thereby elevating earnings per share by 33% since 2018. The company furthermore carries a 3.88% dividend yield and has a highly shareholder friendly management that can run the business. HP has furthermore invested into more diverse revenue streams such as their recent acquisition of Poly. Approximately 75% of office workers are investing to improve their home setups. Traditional office spaces are also being reconfigured to support hybrid work and collaboration, with a focus on meeting room solutions. Currently, there are more than 90 million rooms, of which less than 10% have video capability. As a result, the office meeting room solutions segment is expected to triple by 2024 and HP is certain to profit from this transition.

**Paramount Global (2.41%)**

Paramount Global shares have dropped by 45.76% YTD. The company’s depressed value is due to a highly negative light on the global media outlook and DTC (direct to consumer) businesses. At a PE ratio of 3.85 and a dividend yield of 5.72%, we have time to wait out the storm surrounding media companies. The company is now priced to cheap to ignore any longer. Their streaming service Paramount+,  global revenue grew 95% YoY and they have added 4.6 million subscribers in the past quarter alone. They will launch Paramount+ in France, Germany, Austria and Switzerland in Q4 adding further to their subscriber amount and Paramount+ growing revenue. Total DTC revenue grew 38% YoY. In their theatrical unit: Top Gun: Maverick became the #1 best-selling digital sell-through title in the U.S. in its first week of release. The company continued to execute their differentiated strategy with strong IP assets (some of the studio's most famous iconic films include Titanic, Forrest Gump, The Godfather, Indiana Jones, and Mission: Impossible) which they can all use for generating additional revenue. The company furthermore continues to pay down debt aggressively. In businesses, it can take some time before the growth strategy eventually shows up in the company’s financials, reaching consumers and building various new revenue streams but this brings opportunities towards early observant investors.

Mine stayed consistent at around $50,000,  though I worked overtime, so mine came out a bit different.

I  ended the year at $54,000 gross with $3,000 withheld in federal taxes.  She ended the year at $81,000 gross with $12,500 withheld in federal  taxes. There are other things that complicate this, such as our FSA and a  few other benefits her work offers (we utilize the Roth 401k, not  traditional).

We are filling out  new W-4s for 2023 now. I noticed that in the two jobs section, we can  choose to either use the tables, or just check the box and move on,  leaving the extra withholding section empty. Right now, based on the  tables, she should have an additional $340 withheld every paycheck (she  is paid twice monthly). If we leave it blank, that would mean there's a  $7,600 difference, right?

We don't  want to get to April of 2024 and suddenly owe $7,600. But if we really  did overpay our taxes in extreme amounts this year, we wouldn't want to  do that again either. This year felt lean.

To clarify, our annual wages next year should be around $52,000 for me and $85,000 for her.

EDIT: We also tried the Nerdwallet calculator, and it gave us a result of a $1,000 return. I think we missed the small traditional 401k contributions that were made in the beginning of the year. We had forgotten those had happened, as they were an accident.",finance,1672450577
personalfinance,Budgeting tool that accounts for extensive work spending that gets reimbursed later,"Hi! First post here. I will try to be succinct.

My job has me travelling a lot. We charge expenses to our personal cards, submit receipts, and then get reimbursed after Accounting reviews our receipts. Recently it has been taking longer and longer to get reimbursed because they're short-staffed - like right now I have *four* trips that I've been on since mid-November that have not been payed out.

I've been trying to create a more formal budget for myself but every app I've used that links to my bank account get skewed by several thousands of dollars worth of charges that don't really reflect *my* personal spending. I made an excel spreadsheet and was able to use pivot tables to exclude reimbursable charges but it's an extremely manual process.

Long term, I can't keep up with entering every charge and the amount of detail needed to pull the statistics I want. Plus, I couldn't figure out a good way to account for the multiple credit and checking accounts - the overall balance it was reporting was definitely not accurate (probably because my calculations were off but still). It's gotten to a point where I genuinely have no idea how much money I have and that's a gross feeling.

Is there any app that can link to my bank accounts and pull in transactions, but also includes a way for me to exclude specific transactions from the analytics and tracking? I want to have a better understanding of what I am spending vs. expenses that are going to get reimbursed down the line.",finance,1672451035

CryptoCurrency,Hosting a crypto price chart watch party for New Year eve.,"This year we have decided to do something different for the new year evening party. World for the last one year has felt very monotonous - pandemic, war, inflation, bear markets, hope for bull market, climate change, more pandemic, more inflation, more interest rate hikes..... It almost felt like a dvd running in loop every week.

So a bunch of us thought how do we make it more miserable and came up with this idea - lets just fire up 4 TV Screens with crypto price charts and play games with it. It will be no fancy stuff, just Price charts, beers and friends. Some would cry, some would clinge, some would curse and we will all remind ourself of this pathetic year 2022 and console that lows are real as much as highs were real in 2021. The goal is to embrace the lows and no point denying it or being dilusional. 

In all of this, idea is not to hope for a better 2023 but to remind ourselves that being happy is far beyond markets, pricing, profits, and really comes down to friends, beers, time together and creating occassions.

Wishing everyone happiness and peace, everything else matter less than we lose our sleep for.

# **Stocks fall to end Wall Street’s worst year since 2008, S&amp;P 500 finishes 2022 down nearly 20% - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/29/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)**
*****
&gt; Stocks slipped on Friday to end a brutal 2022 with a whimper, as Wall Street wrapped up its worst year since 2008 on a sour note.
*****
&gt; The Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 73.55 points, or 0.22%, to close at 33,147.25. The S&amp;P 500 shed 0.25% to end at 3,839.50. The Nasdaq Composite ticked down 0.11% to 10,466.88.
*****
&gt; Friday marked the final day of trading in what has been a painful year for stocks. All three of the major averages suffered their worst year since 2008 and snapped a three-year win streak. The Dow fared the best of the indexes in 2022, down about 8.8%. The S&amp;P 500 sank 19.4%, and is more than 20% below its record high, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq tumbled 33.1%.
*****
&gt; Sticky inflation and aggressive rate hikes from the Federal Reserve battered growth and technology stocks and weighed on investor sentiment throughout the year. Geopolitical concerns and volatile economic data also kept markets on edge.
*****
&gt; “We’ve had everything from Covid problems in China to the invasion of Ukraine. They’ve all been very serious. But for investors, it is what the Fed is doing,” said Art Cashin, director of floor operations for UBS, on CNBC’s “The Exchange.”
*****
&gt; As the calendar turns to a new year, some investors think the pain is far from over. They expect the bear market to persist until a recession hits or the Fed pivots. Some also project stocks will hit new lows before rebounding in the second half of 2023.
*****
&gt; “I would love to tell you that it is going to be like the ‘Wizard of Oz’ and everything is going to be in glorious color in a moment or two. I think we may have a bumpy first quarter, and depending on the Fed it may last a little longer than that,” Cashin said.
*****
&gt; Despite the yearly losses, the Dow and S&amp;P 500 did break three-quarter losing streaks in the final three months of the year. The Nasdaq, however, dominated by the likes of Apple, Tesla and Microsoft, muddled through its fourth consecutive negative quarter for the first time since 2001. All three averages are negative for December, however.
*****
&gt; Communication services was the worst performing sector in the S&amp;P 500 this year, falling more than 40%, followed by consumer discretionary. Energy was the only sector to rise, climbing 59%.

&gt; # One Year's Loss Is Not the Next Year's Gain

&gt; It's finally the last trading day of what has been a tough year for most asset classes, especially equities. As of this writing, the S&amp;P 500 is on pace to finish the year with a 19.83% loss. Over the course of the index's history, there have only been nine other years in which the S&amp;P 500 has fallen at least 15% for the full year. Of course, turning the page of the calendar does not mean all the issues dragging stocks lower magically go away, and a big decline one year does not in and of itself mean we're due for a big gain the next year.

&gt; In the chart below we plot the annual percentage change of the S&amp;P 500 versus its move the following year. Taking a linear regression shows that performance one year is not a good explainer for next-year performance with a miniscule R squared of 0.0003. Looking just at those years where the S&amp;P fell 15%+, five times the index posted gains the next year, while four times the index posted further declines.

&gt; # Let’s Look at Stocks Down Two Years in A Row

&gt; As bad as 2022 has been for investors, there is a silver lining: back-to-back declines in the S&amp;P 500 are rarer than you may think.

&gt; If you go all the way back to 1950, the only times that stocks fell in back-to-back years were during the vicious recession of 1973/1974 and then three years in a row during the tech bubble implosion of the early 2000s. Fortunately, we don’t see similar scenarios within the current environment, so I think the odds could favor a snapback in 2023.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Blog-193.png))**

&gt; Taking a closer look into the data, we found:

&gt; * The year after, a negative return saw the S&amp;P 500 up 15% on average and higher 80% of the time.
&gt; * A 10% (or greater) loss showed the following year up only 8.5% on average and higher 63.6% of the time.
&gt; * Out of the 20 negative years, only three times did returns get worse the following year (in 1974, 2001, and 2002).
&gt; * However, the following year, significant losses were rewarded as 20% or more declines saw the next year higher all three times and up 27.1% on average (in 1975, 2003, and 2009).
&gt; * Somewhat surprising to me is the year after a positive year, the returns were only 7.1% on average and higher 68.6% of the time. Take note that the average year since 1950 gained 9.5% and was higher 71.2% of the time.

&gt; # What Happens When Everyone Agrees That Stocks Will Fall?

&gt; “It’s not what you look at that matters; it’s what you see.” Henry David Thoreau

&gt; I’ve done this for more than two decades, and I have to say, the general consensus remains that the first half of next year will be rough for stocks, while the second half of the year should be better. But let’s be clear, overall, the general consensus is that next year will be rough for investors (as we explained here).

&gt; The last time I can recall everyone agreeing on something like this was in 2012 and the fiscal cliff drama. Seriously, it is all anyone talked about in the second half of 2012, and the big worry was that it would wreak havoc on stocks and the economy in the first half of 2013 and beyond. Guess what happened? Stocks soared nearly 30% in 2013, and the economy did just fine.

&gt; You see, the stock market is always pricing things in, and if everyone is talking about it, you better believe the stock market is aware. As Lou Holtz once said, “Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you respond to it.” We are in the midst of one of the worst years ever for investors, and the general consensus is that next year will be bad, also. So the question is, how are we supposed to respond to this?

&gt; What amazes me is how bearish everyone is. Yet, we have inflation coming down very quickly, an economy (while notably slowing, for sure) that we believe is not likely to be headed to a recession (in part, thanks to a very strong consumer), and some of the historically best times to invest based on the calendar.

&gt; That’s right, the first quarter in a pre-election year has been positive an incredible 17 out of 18 times going back to 1950. Oh, it was also up 7.4% on average (the very best quarter out of the entire four-year Presidential cycle). On top of that, the second quarter has also performed quite well, too. So, we potentially have an interesting situation brewing here, and I sure don’t hear too many people pointing out any of the more optimistic news or perspectives.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://www.carsongroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/spx-quarterly-returns.png))**

&gt; Now go back to the quote at the very beginning about what you look at versus what you see. To me, I look at all the worries and concerns as everyone else, but what I see is the potential for a surprise rally that not many are expecting.

&gt; # 2022 Solidified as the Worst Year for Sentiment

&gt; As we noted in an earlier post, today's release of the AAII survey gives us the final reading of the year on sentiment, solidifying a number of points as to just how dour the investor outlook has been.

&gt; For starters, the bull-bear spread heavily favors bears, and that has been the case for some time now. As shown below, the spread has been negative (meaning a higher share of respondents are reporting as bearish than bullish) for a record 39 weeks in a row- over a month longer than the previous record which occurred recently in 2020.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-3a.png))**

&gt; Across all weeks in 2022, bullish sentiment averaged a reading of merely 24.73%. Since the survey began in 1987, that is a record low. In fact, the previous lowest readings were a few percentage points higher at 27.29% and 27.08% in 1988 and 1990, respectively. Meanwhile, the average reading on bearish sentiment was historically elevated at a record of 46.2%, surpassing the prior record set in 2008 by one percentage point. Prior to 2008/2009, only 1990 saw a very high average reading for bearish sentiment.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-1.png))**

&gt; As we highlighted in an earlier tweet, given the low readings on bullish sentiment, there was not even a single week this year in which bullish sentiment came in above its historical average of 37.63%. Of course with a low share of survey respondents reporting as bullish, a larger share would be reporting as bearish. To match the impressive reading with no weeks seeing above-average bullish sentiment, nearly every week this year (51) has seen bearish sentiment come in above its historical average of 31%, tying the record high set in 2009.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122922-AAII-Year-3.png))**

&gt; As previously mentioned, bullish sentiment averaged a reading below 25% this year. Given that reading, it should come as no surprise that 2022 also saw a record number of weeks (30) with bulls below 25%. Prior to this year, 1988 (one year after the survey began) was the prior record at 23 weeks. In other words, this year there were nearly two months more in which less than a quarter of investors reported as bullish than the previous record. Additionally, there had been 17 weeks in which over half of the responses were bearish. Similar to the number of weeks in which bearish sentiment was above average, that ties 2008 for the record high.

&gt; # Grinch visits Wall Street on Last Trading Day of Year

&gt; Last-minute tax-loss selling, old sayings such as “year ends make great exits,” a desire to start with a clean slate, who knows exactly the answer, but the last trading day of the year has turned bearish over the last twenty-two years. Since 2000, NASDAQ and Russell 2000 have the worst records. On the last trading day of the year, NASDAQ has been down in sixteen of the last twenty-two years after having been up twenty-nine years in a row from 1971 to 1999. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have also been struggling recently and exhibit a bearish bias over the last twenty-two years. Russell 2000’s record very closely resembles NASDAQ, gains every year from 1979 to 1999 and only six advances since.

&gt; # Country ETFs in 2022

&gt; Earlier today we published our Global Macro Dashboard which provides an overview of the main economic and market data of 22 major global economies. In the table below, we show the recent performance of the ETFs tracking those same countries.

&gt; With 2022 drawing to a close, there are only two countries that are currently in the green for the year: Brazil (EWZ) and Mexico (EWW). Neither are up much, but up is up, especially in a year like this one.

&gt; In terms of month-to-date change, Hong Kong (EWH) has risen the most with a 5.62% gain, while China (MCHI) is up a modest 0.46%. On the other end of the spectrum, Taiwan (EWT) has fallen sharply with an over 20% decline, but most of that drop is actually due to a $5.18/share long-term capital gain that the fund paid out earlier this month.

&gt; # Pre-Election Year Januarys Stellar - #1 S&amp;P 500 and NASDAQ, #2 DJIA

&gt; January has quite a reputation on Wall Street as an influx of cash from yearend bonuses and annual allocations has historically propelled stocks higher. January ranks #1 for NASDAQ (since 1971), but sixth on the S&amp;P 500 and DJIA since 1950. January is the last month of the best three-consecutive-month span and holds a full docket of indicators and seasonalities.

&gt; DJIA and S&amp;P rankings did slip from 2000 to 2022 as both indices suffered losses in thirteen of those twenty-three Januarys with three in a row in: 2008 to 2010, 2014 to 2016 and then again from 2020 to 2022. January 2009 has the dubious honor of being the worst January on record for DJIA (-8.8%) and S&amp;P 500 (-8.6%) since 1901 and 1930 respectively. Covid-19 spoiled January in 2020 &amp; 2021 as DJIA, S&amp;P 500, Russell 1000 and Russell 2000 all suffered declines in 2020. In 2021, DJIA, S&amp;P 500 and Russell 1000 declined. In 2022, surging inflation, reaching multi-decade highs, stoked fears of substantially higher interest rates in January.

&gt; However, in pre-election years, Januarys have been outright stellar ranking #1 for S&amp;P 500, NASDAQ, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000 and #2 for DJIA. Average gains range from 3.4% by Russell 1000 to a whopping 6.8% for NASDAQ. DJIA and S&amp;P 500 have only declined twice in pre-election Januarys, 2015 and 2003.

&gt; # Falling FAANG+

&gt; Yesterday Amazon (AMZN) became the third of the mega-cap FAANG+ stocks (along with META and NFLX) to close below its closing low made during the COVID Crash in March 2020. Not only have all of AMZN's post-pandemic gains been erased, but it's now trading below its lowest close made during the COVID Crash!

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/amznchart.png))**

&gt; NYSE's FAANG+ index is described as an index of ""10 of today's highly-traded tech giants."" Given that most of the FAANG+ stocks account for a massive portion of the market cap weighted S&amp;P 500, they are an impactful group. As shown below, the FAANG+ index peaked in early November last year and has dropped 46% since then. The drop more recently follows a failed breakout above the top of its downtrend channel as the index is now back to within 5% of this past November's low. On a relative basis, the group has been underperforming the broader market for even longer with a high in February of last year.

&gt; ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2022/12/122822-FAANG-1.png))**

&gt; Below is a look at the ten FAANG+ stocks. As shown, they came into the year with a combined market cap of $12.3 trillion, and they're ending the year with a combined market cap of just over $7 trillion. While Apple (AAPL) has fallen the least YTD in terms of share price change, it has lost the most in market cap at $844 billion. Amazon (AMZN) has seen its market cap fall the second-most at $843 billion, essentially getting cut in half. Tesla (TSLA), along with AMZN, is one of two names that lost their ""$1 trillion market cap"" club status this year. TSLA is now down 69% on the year, and its market cap has fallen from $1.06 trillion down to just $344 billion. The other FAANG+ stocks that are down 50%+ on the year include Meta (META), NVIDIA (NVDA), Netflix (NFLX), AMD, and Snowflake (SNOW).

&gt; With markets continuing to drop in these final trading days of December, on an absolute basis, 2022 is going to go down as the biggest year of wealth destruction ever for the US equity market. In 2008, the Russell 3,000 saw its market cap fall by $6.7 trillion. As of today, the Russell 3,000's market cap has fallen about $11.2 trillion so far in 2022. $5.2 trillion of that $11.2 trillion decline has come from just the ten FAANG+ stocks shown below.

personalfinance,"Saving for a large downpayment, should I continue to max out my 401k?","I'm (28F) saving for a downpayment in a very high cost of living city. I'd like to have at the very least 350k to put down within 2 years. I have 275k saved so far.

I make about 300k per year pre-tax and usually save $130k (401k + HSA + general savings). In the past, I've always maxed out my 401k, but I'm debating whether I should put the full 22,500 in this year, OR just put in 6% to get the match?

I guess I'm really trying to weigh the benefits of a larger downpayment now considering interest rates at the risk of shorting my 401k for a year or two.",finance,1672461268
personalfinance,Co-signing for parents’ car,"Hi Reddit fam,

I am in a predicament where my parents have asked me to co-sign for a new car purchase again. I co-signed back in 2016 and they recently paid off the balance, but they need a second car and asked for me to co-sign to bring the interest rate down. My credit score is around 780 and theirs is.. im not sure. They haven’t told me but I just know it’s really low. 

I feel hesitant for two reasons.
1) They missed a payment for the account I co-signed previously in 2016, making the account 30+days delinquent and my credit score dropped 70 points. I wrote a goodwill letter (their English isn’t good) and they paid the outstanding balance to bring the account to current. I ofc questioned them for why/how they missed the payment and they said they forgot. We had some awkward conversations about it over text, but ultimately the account became current and my score jumped back up, so I let it go. Unfortunately the account is still delinquent on my credit report, so idt my goodwill letter worked. 

2) I want to lower my DTI not increase it. I recently took a student loan to go back to school. I finished, and I’m taking advantage of the pause to save and pay it off. My income is pretty high, but my student debt is around half of my annual income so I’m nervous about taking on more debt. 

I feel so bad rejecting my parents…I know it’s been difficult for them to get around in one car. I don’t know if I’m just being cautious or if I should be more cautious. I’ve read a lot on the topic but still can’t decide. Wanted to see what your thoughts are and what you think I should consider. If you have similar experience and don’t mind sharing, that would be helpful too. Thank you in advance!!!",finance,1672463809
personalfinance,Invest in I Bonds or Pay Off Mortgage that is Going to Increase in Rate Next Spring?,"My friends are homeowners that are finally taking the plunge and knocking down their current house and building anew on their plot of land.  The construction to perm loan will likely start in May/June, however, since they haven’t paid off their existing mortgage, the bank will be buying them out at today’s interest rate.

Their existing mortgage is about $250K at 3.75%, which is obviously more favorable than today’s rates, roughly 8% (and it will likely climb further by next spring).

We were discussing investments, and they explained they are not currently investing as they are pouring all of their current income into paying down their mortgage before being bought out and having to pay the new, higher rate.

They way I see it, they can put $20K+ ($10K for each of them, and they have kids, too, so maybe more) into I bonds and get a 6.89% return on their money.  Mathematically, that would be preferable to the 4.25% (8%-3.75%) advantage in paying down their mortgage.

Am I assessing the situation correctly?  Just want to make sure I’m giving them sound advice.  Thank you in advance!",finance,1672464559
bonds,Buying leveraged municipal bonds via PML,"I don’t see much on here about these types of leveraged municipal bond CEFs. 

I have about $170k that I borrowed at 4.75% fixed for 20yrs. I’m very close to pulling the trigger on spending it all on PML. It yields about 7.8% and I pay no federal income tax. 

My loan payment is about $1,100/mo. And the yield from this would be just a few dollars more than $1,100/mo. 

My plan is to drip the income to grow share count. But if I need to, I could take the monthly income and pay the loan back. Worse case at the end, I’ve paid the loan back with the monthly yield income, and I have the asset free and clear in 20yrs. 

My concerns are the 12+ years duration and almost 50% leverage. I feel like this is within my risk tolerance but looking for any blind spots I may be missing. What might I be missing?

Anyone have a quick minute to chime in? Would be much appreciated. :)",finance,1672468464

personalfinance,Wanting to make sure I can afford the houses that I'm looking at.,"I woke up during the middle of the night and couldn't go back to sleep, so I apologize if this has some sleep deprived ramble vibes.

So a little about myself, I'm 34m, live in a fairly low COL state (Bama). I graduated with a bachelors in Cybersecurity back in May, and landed my first Cybersecurity job in October. I have a 15 yo daughter and we live at my parents. My parents are good loving people but hyper religious and old school, which causes a lot of conflict with my non-religious daughter, and myself to some degree, plus we've been here a long time and it's just past due to leave.

I've been looking for a house for over a year, and even though AL is a low COL state, real estate prices are still high compared to Q1/Q2 of 2021, but they have fallen down some. New builds especially seem to be just sitting there. However, rent is very high for houses. Most houses I see for rent are smaller than the two houses I'll mention below, and cost more to rent than their mortgage payments. I would not do well in an apartment complex, as I am used to living in the woods. I can handle living in a community but I can't jump straight to sharing walls and upstairs neighbors. I also have a lot of hobby gear that would clutter an apartment.

I'm making 95k gross, with a possible 5k performance bonus (seems easy enough to hit, but I started too late in this year to get it I believe). After tax, insurance, 401k, etc I'm bringing home about $2300 bi-weekly. So, most months $4600. I have a Nissan truck from 2015 that's paid off and has been dependable. I work from home, so any gas/travel is mostly discretionary. I just started in Oct but all indications are that the job and I are a good fit for each other and I should be stable, and seems secure. Feedback from my leadership is very positive.  Plus, my industry is critical and with 1-2 years under my belt, I should then be able to always find a job.  My only debt is about 2.5k in credit cards which is WAY down from the 13k or so it used to be. I could pay it off now but trying to keep cash liquid so I'm just making payments of around $500/mo right now. I also have 7k in fed sub student loans. I'm hoping they get forgiven but I'm not banking on it.

&amp;#x200B;

I have enough money for closing costs and down payments with some left over for furnishing or keeping as emergency money. The two houses I'm looking at are listed at 210k and 282k respectively. The 210k is about 1700 sq ft in a small town, the 282k is in a decent sized city for AL standards. My lender quoted me at 6.65%, and the 210k house would be $1500/mo including tax and insurance, and the 282k house would be $2000/mo. I get that's a pretty large jump between the two, but honestly I want to live in the city and I'm ONLY looking at that rural house because of it's low price. If I wanted to live in that city, anything decent starts around 250k for a 3br/2ba 1300-1500 sqft house, so I'd rather pay the extra 30k for how much larger it is (plus brand new).

The pros and cons for the 210k is the price, and it has 3 acres. However the county school isn't great, it's far from stuff and would require more driving, small dating pool (I'm single), and just a boring area. If something were to happen to my job, there are next to NO tech jobs in this area. Seriously, I worked at a credit union as a sysadmin for 35k/yr while in community college because they just don't exist here.I'm definitely confident I could afford the 210k one pretty easy, but it seems the bank that owns it is trying to ring out as much as they can. I looked at it Thursday, and the deadline for offers was Thursday evening. They said they have ""multiple offers and will be accepting highest/best"" but then right after I looked at it, they said they will be extending it to Sunday evening.  I bid 3k over but I'm not willing to get enticed to overbid and overpay for it. So if it falls through....

&amp;#x200B;

The 282k house is a new build, about 2500 sqft, has builder incentives like 10k towards closing and point buy down, 4k lender credit, which would help me a lot with being able to furnish a house from scratch. Builders don't like to knock off list price much, but the price has fallen 18k (when I first saw it 2 weeks ago it was &gt;300k) so I'm  hoping maybe I can negotiate maybe MORE point buy, since they seem to be motivated to sell. If I could buy down to something like 5.75% it would be great. It's close to things, much stronger dating pool, better schools, and if I lost my job, there are some tech jobs, including my old employer (a large university) that I have a good relationship with. They were redoing their pay scale as I left, so my old job as a server admin (60k) is now about 75k.

The 282k house is a dream house but I've estimated 2k principle/interest/tax/PMI/insurance, $200 power average, $80 internet, $80 water/sewage/trash. So all in all, right at 50% of my income. 3 years ago I barely even brought home $2k/mo, so I feel like I could probably survive alright as long as I budget efficiently. I rarely take travel vacations, I don't wear designer clothes. I rotate streaming services. I do have fancy electronics (gaming PC) and sporting goods, but what I have should last me years, and hopefully by then I'll have some raises. I used to eat out way too much, but I'm dieting and working out now, spending much less on food as I eat at home.

All in all, the 282k house seems to be meeting the ""3x your gross income rule""  and if this was 2020 interest rates I know I could afford it, but I missed the boat on the low interest rates (I tried, I got outbid on like 4 houses, and very sparse inventory last year). I know this sub is very conservative fiscally, so I'm sure I'll get at least one response to rent a 1br/1ba apt until I can buy a house cash, but on a serious note, while I'd love to stay at my parents longer and wait for interest rates and list prices to fall, all indications seem to indicate it may not get much better for a while, and we needed to leave yesterday. So any feedback is appreciated.",finance,1672486563
personalfinance,2 missed payments on chase card and score dropped -88 points. Help!,"I have a closed CC with Chase bank that was enrolled in a balance liquidation plan. The plan closed the account, but lowered the interest rate from 27% to 10%. It was set up on automatic withdrawal from my checking account for $72 monthly.

I did not realize until yesterday when checking my score and seeing that it dropped 88 points!! I spoke with Chase and the account is now re-enrolled in the payment plan and everything is caught up. I explained the situation, but they are unwilling to change the delinquent reporting.

I will be immediately putting the $10k sign-on bonus into my emergency savings which are in a high-interest account at 4.1% and that should bump me up to a solid 6 months. I have $26,800 in student loans that I refinanced this year with an interest rate of 2.91%. I don't carry a credit card balance from month to month and have no car payment. I have a mortgage for a one-bedroom condo with a balance of $154k at 2.875% which is valued at around $220K.  My new job has a 401K that matches 100% up to 3% and 50% for the next 3%. Initially, when I started the new job on Dec. 19th, I put contributions at 10%. I have about 20K in the 401K from the old job that I am in the process of putting in a Rollover IRA.

I really want about a year in emergency savings but I also really want to max out my 401k contributions but not sure where I should focus or how I should split it. Maxing out the 401k would be contributing around 20% based on my calculations.

I am also experiencing some lifestyle creep. I use YNAB and have been combing over my budget for the last year pretty closely.

personalfinance,Need help deciding if it makes sense aggressively paying off private low interest student loan or saving/investing,"Over the last year, I have paid off 85% of my CC debt, freeing up some of my income to pay debts/save. I am conflicted whether it makes more sense for me to aggressively pay down my private student loan, to save aggressively, or to do a 50/50 split of my discretionary income. 

**Currently own about 50k in student loans, divided below as such:**

* **Private Student loan with credit union** \- \~**$9,100 at 3.02%** \- min monthly payment **$225.** 5 year loan, paid off in Aug 2026 if paying on minimum. 
* **Federal loans** \- **$41,599.00** \- weighted average interest rate: **4.21%,** no monthly payments as currently frozen. Eligible for 20k forgiveness if it goes through, but I am not hoping on it. Once payment resumes next summer, I estimate my payment to be around $150/month with the new IPR plans. 

My remaining CC debt totaling about **$3k** on an AMEX card. Will have it paid off before the intro APR expires in April. 

I am currently making **$4400/month** after taxes (including health/vision/dental premiums, and contributing 3% to my company offered 401k plan.). I live in a HCOL. 

Within the next year, I am expecting a pay raise of $10-15k/year, with high probably of reaching $120k+/year in the next 5-7 years. I work in a field that is very minimally affected by a potential recession. 

**Current savings: $2,000**

**Retirement - 401k balance is \~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference on how close I am to retirement. 

My company matches 50% of the first 8% of pay contributed, which is vested after 3 years of service. Currently have slight a year of working at my current company. 

Total combined 401k balance is **\~$7,000.** I am 26 for reference how close I am to retirement. 

**Monthly expenses (minimums): $2,171**

* No rent/housing expenses as I live at home, but I pay the electric bill as an agreement - **\~$300**(taking the average through the year)
* Student loan minimum - $**225**
* Other debt minimums (including car, CCs, and installment plans) - $**1041** (lowering to $800 by March 2023)
* Other expenses(phone, car insurance, etc): $**605**

Did not include things like groceries, gas, and other misc. expenses in this, as it is easier to reduce how much I am spending and there are no minimums.

Finally, want to mention that my goal this year is to move out of my parents’ and move to another state (with MCOL) by fall, so having enough savings is important. 

I am open to all feedback. Thank you!",finance,1672504440
personalfinance,Transitioning to independent contractor - what do I need to know? What am I not thinking of? (New Jersey),"I recently retired from 27 years in a public school system (speech language pathologist).  I will now be providing part-time/short-term speech services to public schools as a W9 employee - covering maternity leaves and LOAs, covering caseloads until they find a permanent SLP, etc.  The demand for this type of niche service is pretty big and I'm not too worried about getting gigs, except possibly during the summer - I guess we'll see how that pans out.  

(For reference, when I decided this was what I wanted to do i sent a mail merge to all the special ed directors in two counties.  I sent the email at 12:53 pm and by 1:10 pm was booked Monday through Thursday at two different school districts through the end of the school year.  I have a third district who might be interested in Fridays, but I was kind of hoping to keep Fridays free.)

Anyway, I've never done anything like this before, and I'm afraid I'll screw up my finances.  I'd appreciate help/advice in making sure I have all my bases covered. 

I already have health coverage from my pension, so I don't need to worry about that. I also have professional liability insurance.

To start, my rates are $85/hour and so far both jobs are 7 hour days - so that's $595 per day, $2380 per week.  I think I need to save about 30% for taxes, right?  So that's saving about $715 and banking about $1665 per week?

For taxes, I think I have to pay estimated taxes, but I'm not sure exactly what/how to do that. When I used the IRS Tax Withholding Estimator, it asked if I have a ""job that regularly withholds federal income taxes from your paychecks.""  I said no because nothing is withheld from my check when I get paid, and the tool said that I can't use it.  :-(  It seems like it's only for W4 jobs?

When I do my tax returns, I can claim business expenses now, right?  For instance, I bought my own evaluation kits for $2100, so I can claim those on my tax return?  Can I claim the laptop I bought this year if I am using it for work? (In the fall I contracted just one day per week at a school district and bought the laptop/eval kits to use there.)

Finally, for taxes, is it based on when you did the work, or when you got the money?  Example:  I worked in December for $3600, but won't get paid for that until January.  That still goes on this year's taxes, right?

I also now have to consider that I only get paid on days that I work, so holidays and sick days will affect my paycheck.  I feel like I should set up my own PTO fund so that I don't panic if there's a snow day or if I'm sick.  How do I determine what is an appropriate amount - based off my last job it seems like $550/month is what was contributed to my PTO?

Should I open separate checking/savings accounts to deposit my paychecks in and buy materials/supplies from and then basically pay myself from those accounts, or is it fine to just use my existing personal accounts for everything?

I feel like there are probably tons of things I haven't thought of, or that I'm doing wrong.  Any advice is apprciated!

Just recently started the Freedom Debt Relief program a couple of days ago to take care of my $28,000 unsecured debts and now having second thoughts about it. 

I am worried about the possible lawsuits that might incur and just them not reaching an agreement with my creditors and then I'm just left to deal with the consequences with even higher payments.

Just wondering if anyone has gone through this program and has seen any success or if there is a better option for me. Currently making ends meet paycheck to paycheck.

My first deposit in this program isn't until Jan 12th so I hope I still have time to cancel if this program will backfire on me. Just seeing these reviews on them makes me not want to start it. 

I tried to cancel yesterday but was talked out of it by one of their agents, after doing more research I'm just not sure if I want to stay with this or not.

Again just curious if anyone has done the Federal Debt Relief Program, what your experiences were if it was successful or not, and if there is a better alternative for my debt.

u/menat1 has been kind of right in the first half but was way too bullish for low cap cryptos and Bitcoin itself… I guess we all were hell-bend on seeing a new BTC ATH back then that we could not live without that.

And the comedy-legend of this sub, u/Odlavso , has just made as much of a great prediction that I believe way too many back then (including me) thought is very realistic. The LRC hype especially in Nov and DEc of 2021 was HUGE and singularly one driver for a very bullish sentiment on this sub.

Now u/ra693425 has said it exactly right. WE would not have known shit about fuck. No one could have. People in 2021 were predicting 100k EOY and this year we had some saying 10k EOY. But at the end its all just a guess into the nothing.

Seems like really no one got it right, which is very obvious as we just had such a rollercoaster year with events that no one could have even thought about. At the end really only the prediction “no one knows shit about fuck“ was true. All this once gain shows just how unpredictable Crypto is.

**This years annual survey:**

So now lets come to what our possible prediction this year could be, be sure to comment those and give a small explanation of why you think so, basically a “$100k EOY“ wont be enough. And just as last year, here is y personal guess first:

I think that 2023 wont see a big bull run, for the first half of the year we will just be crabbing and actually pull the final bottom of this bull market. After that we could possibly be going up on a slow pace as the FED pauses rate hikes and other financial markets also rally.",cryptocurrency,1672509720

personalfinance,What to know about a second home ?,"Hi! In early 2020 I bought a condo for $172K when I was 24, jointly with my dad in order to qualify (I had the income to make all the payments, just not the income history or down payment). Thought I would live there quite a while, but had an unexpected job opportunity so I moved and now I rent (for a federal civil service job), and I have a renter in the condo and make about $250/month profit from the rental price. I think the condo may now be worth something like $200K, based on recent sales in the complex, and I have $150K to go on the mortgage.

I love my new city and like the job, and I hope to stay in federal service in this area for sure. I daydream regularly about owning instead of renting my primary residence, but I am wondering what I ought to know about trying to purchase a second condo in new city without changing the arrangement of the old condo (renter likes it, I like keeping it as an investment). I would be looking for about the $300-350K range. 

Will the requirements for me be higher trying to get a second mortgage, this time solo? Does it help me? Could I still do something like a 5% down payment and PMI (how I did old condo), or would they want it higher? Will my age work against me? Anything at all I should know would be so helpful!!

personalfinance,Can a collection agency garnish social security payments?,"I have been managing my elderly mother-in-law’s finances for a year now, after her husband passed away. He did the majority of the bill paying so I took over the job to help her out. They had no savings and were both reliant on social security as their sole income. With his passing, she now only makes about $950 from social security each month.

She drains her bank account to zero whenever the social security payment hits each month and barely squeaks by. For Christmas, she decided to buy us and several family members gifts from the Montgomery Ward catalog using their credit. My mother in law is a very nice woman, but I guarantee she was lured in with a “Buy Now, Pay Later” scheme without thinking through the details of interest rates, etc.

Since we manage her finances, we asked to see the bill so we could get it paid for her and balance her monthly budget. She charged nearly 500 dollars to this credit account. She also did not hand over the info until we asked and she already missed this month’s payment due date. Apparently they want her to pay 25 a month plus 25.99% interest for the next 17 months or so. Honestly, her budget is down to zero each month- she cannot even afford the 25 a month. 

I would imagine the bill goes to collections eventually if she doesn’t pay. (I am pretty clueless with this as I have never carried a balance on a card or anything like that) Can a collection agency garnish her social security? She has a bank account that she basically only uses to cash out her social security…she doesn’t own a car or any property. What are the consequences if this bill goes unpaid? (We don’t care if her credit is trashed- we don’t want her in another situation like this.) She claims she did not provide her bank account/debit card info when applying for the credit but not sure what to believe- she will fib to us sometimes. Unfortunately she believes it’s the Montgomery Wards of the past and doesn’t believe us when we tell her it’s an overpriced/scammy online company now.",finance,1672515015

personalfinance,Credit Card Debt Repayment Plan,"Hi all, I'm writing this post in search of methods to pay off all of my CC debt. 

I currently have 2800 in checking/cash, although my debts (5380) are:

BOFA 2800 @ 24.74% (around $58 in interest/month)

CFU 1000 @ 0% until 09/23

AMEX 780 @ 25.24% (around $28 in interest/month)

CSP 800 @ 26.74% (around $29 in interest/month)

Monthly Take-Home: 3600 - 1200 in fixed expenses then 2400 goes towards savings &amp; debt repayments

Been stuck in CC debt since taking some weekend trips in June 2022, but now I'm trying to maximize my savings rate. I stopped using debit cards to start gaining CC rewards and quickly got caught up in lifestyle inflation, eating out, etc. Looking to eliminate all debt as soon as possible - I was considering using the 2800 to bring my total debt down to 2580, then taking out a loan but interest rates are way too high atm. Did a pre-qualification check with Discover and they quoted - ($90 monthly, 17.99%, 36 months) to ($57, 20.99%, 84), (if I took the loan, I can still put towards my savings and pay down the loan at the same time). I get paid bi-weekly, (1st and 15th), but already received my 1st check prior to Christmas and will only be receiving 1800 for the month of January.

I also have 1600 in savings and \~1900 in long-term stocks, but I'm not looking to pull out of any of those. Also down about 19% YTD on the stocks as I started investing last year, so yeah not touching that as of yet. Although if necessary, I could possibly tap into the savings - that's my last option. Much appreciated everyone, thanks.",finance,1672517290
investing,Where to start with bond investing,"With the availability of high yielding, short-dated treasuries and a questionable equity market, I've become interested in bond investing for the first time ever. I work in financial services, so I'm relatively well versed in investments products and understand bond fundamentals like interest rate risk, credit risk, etc. 

I poked around the fixed income section of my brokerage (Fidelity) and was confused and overwhelmed. I filter for T bills and I get 100s of cusips with terms I've never seen before eg. I had never heard of yield to worst before.

Any tips on getting better educated on bonds and the practical side of it, like how to actually trade it on a brokerage and things to consider in terms of the logistics? Not looking to do anything sophisticated. Just trying to buy 3month treasuries to lock in a \~4% yield. Might consider longer duration and corporates at some point.",finance,1672520716

personalfinance,Can I get in hot water over family members making large ebay purchases with my account?,"Tl;Dr - in-laws make high ticket purchases on eBay using my account and they pay me for the purchases. Makes me feel uneasy doing it but unless it's illegal I can't easily just say no. Am I getting myself into future trouble?

My in-laws have seasoned, fluid cash that is gotten legally from 1099 contract jobs, and they also have expensive tastes. They frequently find items on ebay that are high ticket amounts and they total way over the CTR limits.

Since they don't have an ebay account of their own and only a basic credit union account, they are putting the cash in my account (with a national association traditional bank) and I make the purchases on their behalf using my debit card. 

We've never structured the transactions, but they total easily over $25k over a month or so.

My personal financial picture is very different usually, and this amount is equal to half my yearly salary(!) - very uncharacteristic for my usual deposit activity.

Am I opening myself up for liability? Would FinCEN refer the CTR to the IRS and trigger them to want to tax me on these deposits as earned income? I only want to assist them in purchasing the things they want as they can't make the transaction on their own, I don't want to trigger any sort of money laundering investigation.

It makes me feel uncomfortable though, but without any sort of legal framework suggesting this is a breach of my banks terms and conditions or federal law, I find it difficult to say no to their requests. Any money they deposit is a 100% pass-through and I do not earn anything from doing this.

Any constructive advice is appreciated. Thanks.",finance,1672520780
