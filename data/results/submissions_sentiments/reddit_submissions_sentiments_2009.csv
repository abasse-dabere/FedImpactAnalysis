Does anyone see that is happening? This situation is so fucked up and complicated, it takes a room full of mathematicians just to explain it in theorems.

First we rolled up bad loans into securities and parted out the securites to banks, then the securities failed and we bought banks with tax dollars. Banks, which are given money to lend out by the government, were bought by tax dollars, money that is loaned out to people, by banks then taken by the government to give to banks... what the fuck does that even mean??? Now we're saying we want to audit the fed, the people who give the banks their money, when all the fed does is decide when we should print money? Does this make any sense at all?

http://digg.com/world_news/Federal_Reserve_to_Gain_power_under_Obama_plan?t=26323179#c26337031

There is an easy solution to this situation Mr. Trogdor. It's so simple that 90% of people will have trouble comprehending it. Paper money is worthless, the only value we assign it is the trust we place in the Fed not to print more of it. It is worthless because some asshole who think he knows how to run the world can just print more of it when he thinks it is a good idea, and spend it where he thinks he needs to. Some asshole who thinks he's smarter then every other person on this planet combined. He thinks he's averting a catastrophe and helping humanity. Instead he's fucking nature like a crack-idled whore, and billions of people will die as a result. Hey great, evolution says the man in the ivory tower. No free healthcare he says, that would allow undesirables to reproduce, diluting the gene pool with their sub-par genes which couldn't make $money$ to afford health care. $Money$ that this person just made up out of thin air and means absolutely nothing, and represents nothing but this persons' will. Money should be illegal.

The system continues to succeed DESPITE the will of the Fed. That's how well an real honest free market works.

So the fed, which decides how fast to print money, printed to much money that the banks couldn't give it out fast enough, so they had to give it to people who couldn't' pay it back. We took money from the working people via taxes to pay for the loans they couldn't pay back to the fed, so the people who couldn't afford to pay it back could go on borrowing more money, but the banks kept the money, so the economy stalled, so we printed more money, so now we want to audit the fed, who doesn't even keep money, they only decide how much to print. and NOW we want to let the fed take over companies who borrowed too much money, so they can keep the economy from crashing, by buying up the companies with tax money....

So basically what is going on is we are taking money from the government and giving it to failing corporations so people who have jobs at these corporations can continue being irresponsible and blaming each others lack of productivity on each other, while they get paid to do it.

programming,"Why not share some of the ideas from the book yourself? (spawned from the ""Top Indian CEO"" thread)","Ok, so a couple of days ago I replied to the [Top Indian CEO](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8uiuq/top_indian_ceo_most_american_grads_are/) thread, and said:

&gt; Anybody here who hasn't read [The World Is Flat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_is_Flat), I encourage you to do so.  It's an eye-opening read, and highly informative when discussing stories like this one.

To which [SmartfulDodger](http://www.reddit.com/user/SmartfulDodger) replied:

&gt; I think it's a great suggestion, but it doesn't do much for the conversation here. Why not share some of the ideas from the book yourself?


That's a fair response, so I'll address it here.  For starters, I didn't elaborate then mainly because of lack of time to stop and distill Friedman's ideas into easily digestible chunks.  Especially since I'm about 3/4 of the way through the book myself, and will want to re-read my notes again at least once to convince myself that I have the high points down.


That said, I'll take a stab now at sharing some of what I got from the book, vis-a-vis the discussion of globalization that spawned from the original thread:

One of the big takeaways from that book is that the ""flattening of the world"" does create more competition and may cause short term pain for some individuals, who aren't well suited for dealing with change, but that it also creates lots of new opportunities for individuals.   For example, with the use of the Internet, contract manufacturing, and managed supply chain / logistics services from FedEx, UPS, Amazon.com, etc. you can essentially start your own manufacturing firm and do business on the global market, with a very small initial investment, making this sort of thing far more accessible to individuals than ever before.

You can even turn outsourcing to your advantage...  there are ways to add value, which layer on top of the availability of check foreign labor.  If nothing else, vetting the quality of work and providing a local interface for the foreign labor.  So, set up a programming shop, do the ""high touch"" stuff yourself, and farm out the grunt work to India or the Phillipines or whatever.  Outsourcing is NOT just something big corporations do... individuals can do it to.   Use your imagination.

There's a lot more to it than that, but that ought to help seed the conversation.

edit:  Another point to make.  One of the ""flattening forces"" that Friedman talks about is Open Source software.  I'll point out that, again, this creates opportunities for motivated people.  Let's say you want to become an ERP consultant or specialize in helping businesses with application integration.   Look at Open Source ERP and CRM systems like [Adempiere](http://www.adempiere.com/) or [OpenCRX](http://www.opencrx.org/ ) and ask yourself ""Could I download, install and learn this, and then make a business out of helping small businesses adopt this stuff?""  Or look at all the great Open Source stuff Sun has made available, like [Glassfish](https://glassfish.dev.java.net/ ), [OpenESB](https://open-esb.dev.java.net/), [Mural](https://mural.dev.java.net/), [OpenSSO](https://opensso.dev.java.net/ ), etc, and ask the same question.

Or here's another thought: assuming you're an expert in something, how about using [Moodle](http://www.moodle.org), developing online courses around your area of expertise, and setup a training company?  People are also making money as [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org) consultants. Again, just food for thought...
  
If there's a point to all of this, it's that there are lots of opportunities out there, especially for people who can provided highly specialized, ""high touch"" services, or who generally who how to add value to an organization.  Combine that with an entrepreneurial bent, and it doesn't matter WTF a ""Top Indian CEO"" thinks.  Who needs his jobs?  We'll create our own.",technology,2009-06-25,0.0188896443415496

When reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/8wzmo/ropes_how_theyll_rescue_you_from_programming/) a few ideas came together in my head.  Basically, I think I want to represent strings as ropes by default.  My thinking is this:

1. In the case of short text, the overhead of the ropes will almost certainly be dwarfed by the overhead of the interpreter itself (small ropes are usually essentially just strings anyway).

2. In the case of long text, most use cases would benefit from the rope structure rather than the traditional string structure.  This may change as I see who actually ends up using my language when I go public, but it holds true at least for my own usage so far.

3. My language features a garbage collector that defragments and compacts during idle cycles (based on the observation that most programs are IO gated).  Since text is going to be a basic datatype, my garbage collector could also ""flatten"" the ropes into strings during idle cycles as part of the overall concept of optimizing memory during idle cycles.

Of course this will all have to be validated by careful benchmarking.

My question to Proggit is: are there any other potential downsides to this idea that I'm missing?",technology,2009-07-01,-0.0347795923119904

Act","Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D -- CA), Representative Henry Waxman (D -- CA), Representative Ed Markey (D -- MA), Senator Barbara Boxer (D -- CA), and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D -- CA) are introducing, simultaneously in the House and the Senate,

The 2009 US National Clean Basketball Fairness and Recovery Act

The act mandates for all academic and professional basketball teams a new rule:

Each player over 5' 6"" must carry their own weight in lead in backpacks.

The height of 5' 6"" will be ratcheted down to 5' by the year 2016.

President Obama explained:

Make no mistake:  This is a jobs bill which will create many new jobs in and for professional basketball and will make the short basketball players the winning basketball players.

You can still be seven feet tall and play basketball if you want, it is just that if you jump the lead weight on your back will break the bones in your feet.

Representative Waxman remarked:

It has been my lifelong dream to play basketball for the Los Angeles Lakers, and now I will be able to!

Representative Markey was unavailable for comment; his staff explained that he was practicing his layups to be ready to play for the Boston Celtics.

There will be a new 'weigh and trade' program where players can buy exemptions for up to 20% of their weight, to be ratcheted down to 0% by the year 2020, from players carrying more than their required weight.  The weigh and trade program will be administered by the SEC which will within 90 days draft rules for a regulated exchange for trading weights.  The Department of Homeland Security will have a new agency which will audit the weigh and trade programs and will have subpoena powers as needed for their audit investigations.

Other countries that do not conform to this clean and fairness legislation can face tariffs, trade sanctions, and trade barriers.

There will be a new Federal Government agency in the Department of Health and Human Services before each game to measure the heights and weights of players and weigh the lead backpacks.

There will be special exemptions for historically disadvantaged basketball players -- females, elderly, persons with medical conditions, and others.

To administer these special exemptions, the National Institutes of Health will establish a new agency audited by the US Department of the Treasury.

The EPA will establish a new agency to measure the CO2 emissions by both players and the audience at each indoor basketball game.  Outdoor basketball will be prohibited.  The CO2 emissions will be part of the CO2 pollution cap and trade program already passed by the House.  The work of the EPA in this CO2 monitoring will be audited by OSHA.

The Department of Energy will receive $50 billion to fund new basketball shoes which will equalize the jumping ability of all players and, thus, create a fair, level playing field in basketball.

House Minority Leader Representative John Boehner (R -- OH) stated:

""This bill is a basketball tax and government getting on the backs of the citizens.""

H.R. 2454, the 'American Clean Energy And Security Act of 2009'

Dear John,
 
Thank you for contacting me with your concerns about the Federal Reserve System.  During an economic crisis we must be sure that all agencies charged with control over our economic system are functioning properly and with effective oversight.
 
The Federal Reserve System serves as the central bank for the United States.  As part of this role, the Federal Reserve acts as a lender to financial institutions during times of economic crisis.  This country has recently experienced the full impact of the Federal Reserve.  In the fall of 2008, the ability to access funds from capital markets abruptly ended for many financial institutions, causing a ""liquidity crunch"" and sharpening the economic downtown.  To preserve banking operations across the country, the Federal Reserve expanded its balance sheet by purchasing assets from other financial institutions.  These actions added over one trillion dollars to the financial system.  
 
Deciding the appropriate level of oversight for the Federal Reserve has long been a matter of debate among policy-makers, dating from the creation of the system in 1913.  I share some of the concerns that this institution, which controls considerable amounts of public funds, has limited day-to-day oversight by Congress. While the Federal Reserve Transparency Act would allow for an audit of the Federal Reserve, we must be careful to strike an appropriate balance between effective oversight and political autonomy.  The Reserve's ability to make monetary policy absent political influence is vital to a healthy financial system.  
 
Thank you again for contacting me about this important issue. I will continue to monitor this closely and appreciate your thoughts.

Sincerely,
Earl Blumenauer

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article6644817.ece

and below is the truth of the matter- Qom is a city of 900,000 Iran is a country of 72 Million, these clerics supported Mousavi all along, but that doesn't mean very much.

Clerics of Qom = *Minority* of ***reformist*** clerics who already supported Mousavi join Mousavi's chorus of rioters.*

http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;ct=res&amp;cd=1&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ft.com%2Fcms%2Fs%2F0%2F957da1de-697d-11de-bc9f-00144feabdc0.html&amp;ei=QCRSSqG1MovKtgfl37myBA&amp;rct=j&amp;q=rancourous+iran+financial+times&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHkRt01l0-OBIw-IC3izFavjzThQ

This is spin hype and distortion- that's why it's on the front page of reddit. Do your research and you will discover the Association of Researchers and Teachers of Qom is actually a minority of reformist clerics.. not what it has been hyped up to be in the jewish run media. Or you could sit back and be spoon fed lemming pudding.. which is what most of you usually do.

You will notice the Rothschilds are also involved in the ownership of the Times, and Rupert's Empire of Zionist Media.

*“Rupert’s father Sir Keith Murdoch attained his prominent position in Australian society through a fortuitous marriage to the daughter of a wealthy Jewish family, née Elisabeth Joy Greene. Through his wife’s connections, Keith Murdoch was subsequently promoted from reporter to chairman of the British-owned newspaper where he worked. There was enough money to buy himself a knighthood of the British realm, two newspapers in Adelaide, South Australia, and a radio station in a faraway mining town,” Candour wrote in 1984. “For some reason, Murdoch has always tried to hide the fact that his pious mother brought him up as a Jew.”*

Rupert is a rabid zionist and you can rest assured his stories in his papers will be there to advance the zionist agenda, as forensic research of his stories have continually shown- looking back. If it involves talking shit about any of Israel's enemies- Rupert will be holding the megaphone to the ear of the world shouting it out for them.

Rupert (actually Keith Rupert) Murdochs father was Keith Murdoch (died 1952), his mother Elisabeth Joy (nee Greene) and yes her mother, Marie Grace de Lancey Forth was born from a jewish mother.

Ruperts paternal grandfather, Patrick John, was the REV., the maternal grandmother was Marie Grace de Lancey Forth, who was born in Warnambool VIC (Australia), HER mother Caroline Jemima (nee Sherson) was born to a jewish family, hence by ""jewish law"", making Rupert jewish.

So in closing.. for the ignorant and slow learners- there are a few different kinds of jews out there- religious jews who practice the jewish faith, racial jews who are jewish by lineage, and ashkenazi jews who are sort of a middle ground- they are descended from khazars who adopted the jewish faith but are generally accepted as if they were racial jews. Sephardic jews that practice judaism are the ""true"" jews, esp if they are orthodox, that's as jewish as you can be. Rupert Murdoch is jewish by jewish law, born to a jewish mother, does not practic Judaism but is a Zionist and has contributed greatly to the cause of Israel both monetarily and by his purposeful slanting of the news. This story about the clerics is no exception, it's just more of the same, spin for Israel's gain. In Jewish law if you are born to a Jewish mother, you are a jew. Rupert is a jew, and a zionist, but doesn't practice Judaism publicly if at all, but he definitely practices Zionism publicly and was friends with Ariel Sharon.

Sam Kiley quit The Times over the Zionist propaganda agenda of the paper:

Economics,"An argument that shows the Fed artificially lowers long term interest rates even though it only ""targets"" short term rates.","In what appears to be his closest reference to credit expansion, Greenspan wrote, in an article in The Wall Street Journal of March 11, 2009:

""There are at least two broad and competing explanations of the origins of this crisis. The first is that the ""easy money"" policies of the Federal Reserve produced the U.S. housing bubble that is at the core of today's financial mess.

The second, and far more credible, explanation agrees that it was indeed lower interest rates that spawned the speculative euphoria. However, the interest rate that mattered was not the federal-funds rate, but the rate on long-term, fixed-rate mortgages. Between 2002 and 2005, home mortgage rates led U.S. home price change by 11 months. This correlation between home prices and mortgage rates was highly significant, and a far better indicator of rising home prices than the fed-funds rate.

This should not come as a surprise. After all, the prices of long-lived assets have always been determined by discounting the flow of income or imputed services by interest rates of the same maturities as the life of the asset. No one, to my knowledge, employs overnight interest rates—such as the fed-funds rate—to determine the capitalization rate of real estate, whether it be an office building or a single-family residence.""

. . .

In these passages Greenspan invents a version of the opposition to Federal Reserve sponsored credit expansion that no opponent of credit expansion or “easy money” has ever held. No opponent of credit expansion has ever claimed that reductions in the federal-funds rate need directly affect long-term interest rates. To the contrary, the significance of reductions in the federal-funds rate is that what is required to bring them about in the actual market for those funds is an increase in member-bank reserves. The increase in those reserves is then the foundation of credit expansion to a vast multiple of the additional reserves. That credit expansion is what then serves to lower long-term interest rates, such as mortgage rates.

The way the process works is as follows. To actually achieve the lower federal-funds rate that it announces as its target, the Federal Reserve goes into the market and buys government securities from banks or the customers of banks. It pays for those securities by means of the creation of new and additional standard money. When the Fed purchases securities from banks, the banks directly and immediately have equivalently more reserves in their possession. When it purchases securities from the customers of banks, the banks gain equivalently more reserves as soon as those customers deposit the checks they have received that are drawn by the Fed on the Fed. These checks are then forwarded to the Fed and the reserve accounts of the banks in question are equivalently increased.

Depending on the amount of their increase, the immediate effect of the additional reserves is to reduce or eliminate deficiencies in the required reserves of some, many, or all of the banks that have had such deficiencies, to replace deficiencies of reserves with excesses of reserves, and to increase the excess reserves of some, many, or all of the banks that have had excess reserves. The effect of this in turn is to reduce the demand for federal funds, i.e., funds that qualify as reserves, while increasing their supply. This combination is what brings down the federal-funds rate in the market for federal funds.",finance,2009-07-09,-0.0843802723277778

Martyn Williams, IDG News Service, July 14, 2009

The U.K. was the likely source of a series of attacks last week that took down popular Web sites in the U.S. and South Korea, according to an analysis performed by a Vietnamese computer security analyst.

The results contradict assertions made by some in the U.S. and South Korean governments that North Korea was behind the attack. Security analysts had been skeptical of the claims, which were reportedly made in off-the-record briefings and for which proof was never delivered.

The week-long distributed denial of service attack involved sending multiple requests to a handful of Web sites from tens of thousands of computers so the sites became overloaded. Among the sites taken offline at some time during the week were those of the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Treasury, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission, the South Korea's president's home page, the South Korean national assembly and U.S. Forces Korea.

The computers used to send the flood of requests had been infected with a virus that allowed attackers to use them anonymously.

Every three minutes the infected computers randomly selected one of eight servers to connect to and receive orders, said Nguyen Minh Duc, senior security director at Bach Khoa Internetwork Security (Bkis), in a [blog posting](http://blog.bkis.com/?p=718) on the company's Web site. Bkis says it gained control of two of the eight servers and through this has been able to discover the master server.

That server has an IP address in the 195.90.118.x range, Nguyen said.

The address is registered to Global Digital Broadcast in the U.K. The company could not immediately be contacted.

""Having located the attacking source in UK, we believed that it is completely possible to find out the hacker,"" Nguyen wrote.

Through analyzing the log files of the two servers it controls, Bkis said the attacks utilized 166,908 PCs in 74 countries that had been infected. That figure is significantly higher than the ""several tens of thousands"" that other security companies had estimated were involved.

The largest number of infected PCs were in South Korea followed by the U.S., China, Japan, Canada, Australia, the Philippines, New Zealand, the U.K. and Vietnam.

Nothing against my employer, they're great. They offer me all sorts of freedoms that I'm absolutely sure I wouldn't be able to enjoy at other companies and that is really great! I'm really greatful for that, but there is something that they're not giving me: challenges. Because of this (my unhappiness), I'm sortof a jerk to my co-workers, which is something that they don't deserve. I don't mean to be short and mean to them, but when I get asked for the 19th time why I have ""locked them out"", and have to explain that num lock is not turned on, my fuse can start getting short (especially if I'm working on a coding project, the interruption will absolutely destroy my concentration). Well, for the last couple of weeks I've been helping one of my friends who is currently still in school with a project that he has been tasked with (he is a research assistant). The problem is how to walk around in some really large datasets full of dumps off of climate-monitoring satellites (aerosol data). Helping him with this project was an excuse for me to learn about database sharding, something I have been meaning to do for a while.

Well...here is the thing: I am an addict, and my drug is challenge. I know that sounds stupid and cheesy, haha, but I'm not kidding. I get really really horrifyingly, dangerously (as in: dangerously) depressed when I'm not doing things that are intellectually stimulating for me. Helping my friend with this project was like giving somebody that has kicked a crack habit just. one. more. rock. to celebrate their sobriety! sigh bad things.

Well...I have decided that I want to go back to school! Hooray! (I dropped out of school when I was 19 years old and was offered this job. They wanted somebody with linux/bsd experience, and a heavy networking background.) At the time, it was my dream job. I was going to be an ADMIN! HOORAY! The honeymoon took about 2 years to wear off. :(.

So now comes the time to pick a major. Reddit, will you help me? What I want to get into is high performance computing systems. I'm really not interested in a degree, quite honestly. I'm interested in some Universities letting me ""play"" with their multi-million dollar computing clusters; something that I would never, ever be able to build myself. I'm looking for some classes that are going to throw really difficult problems at me, and let me figure out how to solve them.

One thing that piqued my interest a few days ago were some guys from fedex and the usps arguing on slashdot. They were talking about their systems, and how they're processing hundreds of millions of transactions per day. That sounds so freaking cool to me because it sounds really hard.

Basically I'm asking what the major is called that involves ""Play with really fraking huge computer machines.""",technology,2009-07-16,-0.1598064686480538

The bill linked too seems to me to be too open to interpretation. We don't need more laws to regulate the social well-being of our citizenry. Opinions aren't going to change with laws. Hatred can only be admonished through love. And you need people to live happy lives to give love, and people need good healthcare and a good economy if they're to be happy.

politics,Pat Obrien Borks it in Public on the Rachel Maddow Show,"Pat Buchanen, former speechwriter for Richard Nixon (that's been the high
point of his career), attempted to claim that ex-Solicitor General Robert Bork
was better qualified to be a Supreme Court justice than Mrs. Sotomayor. 
This is such an outrageous statement that it must be rebutted.

&lt;dl&gt;
  &lt;dt&gt;Bork (verb i. ""to Bork"")&lt;/dt&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;1. To perform one's official duties in such a toadying, openly illegal
manner as to straddle the border of treason.&lt;/dd&gt;
    &lt;dd&gt;2. To render a false legal opinion, to curry favor or for financial
gain. Example: John Yoo Borked it in the torture memos.&lt;/dd&gt;
&lt;/dl&gt;

""Bork"" entered common usage during the Watergate investigation, after the
""Saturday Night Massacre,"" and the ensuing Constitutional Crisis.  In the
Saturday Night Massacre, then-President Richard Nixon, ordered the offices 
of Special Prosecutor Archibald Cox to be raided by the FBI, and for Cox to
be fired.  Attorney General Richardson refused to carry out this illegal
order, and resigned in protest.  The Deputy Attourney General also
resigned.

The authority of Attorney General now fell to the number 3 man in the
department, Solicitor General Bork.  He carried out the illegal order,
instructing the FBI to interfere with the investigation, and carry out
warrentless search and seizure, not against a suspected criminal, but
against an official of the Federal government, only suspected of carrying
out his legal duties properly.

When Reagan appointed Bork to the Supreme Court, Bork grew angry while
being questioned during his Senate confirmation hearings, and withdrew his 
name from consideration. He was being questioned about the Saturday Night
Massacre, although newspaper reports that he had rented dozens of
pornographic videos may have also influenced his decision.

This is the person that Pat Buchannen said, was more qualified to be on the
court, than Mrs. Sotomayor.  In my opinion, that could only be true if you 
wanted someone who would willingly sanction illegal acts, (like torture).",finance,2009-07-17,-0.6744932705574239

gaming,So I decided to buy some Fallout 3 DLC today.,"For the record, I've not played FO3 in a fair few months now - I finished the game (or rather, the main quest), found that it just ended, and wandered off to play other things.


Lately, I was thinking about buying a new single-player game, for when friends aren't around online - aha! Fallout 3! I've barely even scratched the surface of it's wonderful post-apocalyptic world, it'll truly keep me occupied for a fair few hours.

So after loading it back up again, I remember vaguely hearing about this new DLC that's available - notably, the new Point Lookout pack that increases the cap to level 30. Even better, I think to myself - now I'll have even more of a reason to explore the world, looting and shooting as I go.

I mean, I've heard horror stories about the GfWL Marketplace, but it can't be *that* bad, surely? Surely. Oho.

So I open the GfWL tab in FO3, and the first thing that I'm greeted with is a nice ""You must update to log in"" message. Ok. That's cool. It's been months since I last played; no doubt there's some patches and stuff. I click yes.

An hour later, nothing's happened. The little blue bar sits there immobile, taunting me with it's shininess.

Fine, I think. I'll download it from the website instead. One pointless age verification and a couple of clicks later, the patch is transported to me via the magic of the interwebs. I pause for a second, and wonder why the in-game patcher seemed to do nothing. No matter! I can now log in.

So I do, and I'm greeted with the GfWL tab interface in all it's pastel glory, like a toddler eating a pack of Crayolas, then projectile vomiting them into your eyes. Hm. No Marketplace button. I futilely click around for a bit, wondering how to get to the ""Buy Stuff Here"" section.

A flash of inspiration hits me. Of course, it's an external website. Only silly people would integrate a shop into the game itself, after all. So, back out of the game, and I start searching for the Marketplace. For the first time ever, Google fails me. The official site contains no clues. Where In The World Is The GfWL Marketplace?

An advert pops up on the website - ""Get The Client Now!"", it implores me. Almost pleading. Yes, that was it, I remember now - sometime years back, when I bought some game, it installed the GfWL Client on my PC somewhere. I go hunting.

Flush with victory - I can't be far from my goal - I load up the client. Another update is required. Apparently, this one isn't included in all the MS Updates I run - it's ""special"", the black sheep of the Hotfix family, shunned by its peers. Download, install - a restart is needed. Sigh.

Finally, finally, the GfWL Client loads up. And dear god, who designed [this monstrosity](http://imgur.com/pHSLT.jpg)? If the tab was like projectile toddler-pastel-vomit, then this is like a large burly man forcibly inserting the aforementioned Crayolas into your optic nerve. And even better, it looks completely broken.

Whatever. I'm not here for the design, I just want to give them money and get the hell out, much like a seedy back-street dealer in a dimly lit alleyway. Finally, a Marketplace tab. So very close now - there can't be much more.

And there we go, the light at the end of the tunnel: my prized DLC. Hm. I need to add MS Points to my account. Whatever, I'm fed up now. I don't even care that I'll end up buying more points than I need, with them sitting helplessly in my account, crying out like baby seals. I just want this over with. I click Add Points, and fill in the blanks.

Your credit card could not be authorized.

Well, yeah, it probably couldn't - it's a debit card, after all. There's got to be a debit card option somewh- oh. Oh. Fuck you, Microsoft. You've got to be kidding me.

Moderately irate by this point, I resort to Plan B (which sadly lacks death-lasers). Sure, I've wasted my time so far, but I can probably just buy it from a retail shop, and have it delivered in a day or so. Wait - it's not released in retail until late August? Seriously. And to top it all off, it'd still be cheaper to buy it from a shop than it would to download it. Viva la digital revolucion! No distribution costs means a cheaper product, my fucking arse.

I give up, I honestly do. It's as though I'm standing here, pants stuffed with money, and Microsoft are going ""No! No! Take it away! We don't want it!"". I have no idea how anyone can make it so hard to let *other people* give them money.

The amusing thing is, if I decide to torrent it tomorrow (and buy it when it comes out), I'll almost certainly have it in a few hours, install it with no issues, and not have to worry about all the other crap that a normal, nice consumer has to go through. And yet they wonder why people pirate games...",technology,2009-07-21,-0.0734580294309759

It's got a black character so that means it's racist. ""HOLY SHIT A BLACK CHARACTER."" 

You take that new Final Fantasy game for example, right? And it's got this black guy with an afro in it ""OH MY GOD THAT IS SO RACIST, AN AFRO?!"" and he's got like this bird living in it. ""THAT IMPLIES THAT BLACK PEOPLE DO NOT WASH THEIR HAIR. RACIST."" 

You start off by playing a confederate soldier in that Call of Juarez game, and history teaches us that confederates had slaves THEREFORE the game is RACIST! OH, SHIT!

Vampire: Bloodlines had gay characters in them. ""OH SHIT, HOMOPHOBIA!"" because gay people don't exist in real life amirite? And if they're black that means ""THIS GAME IMPLIES THAT ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE GAY. RACIST.""

It is more dangerous to centralize when greedy people are around. That's what is happening for a long time now. Had the interest rates been high, instead of near zero now, US would have saved a lot of money. Had the interest rates been high for the past 15 years, we would have had 2 or 3 small recessions.

http://majorityrights.com/index.php/weblog/comments/best_defense_of_the_federal_reserve_not_out_of_thin_air/

I originally thought this guy was wrong since when the original loan is paid to someone and redeposited, 90% of that redeposit is loaned out again multiplying the money supply by 90%. Then it occurred to me that every loan, once spent is mirrored by an equivalent opposite side of the trade where real wealth is being paid for.

Comparing to my personal leaning toward mutual credit this may actually turn out to be more conservative? In mutual credit every transaction involves the buyer being debited an equal sum to the amount the seller is credited. The whole economy's net money supply is then 0 with credits and debits expanding and contracting at equal and opposite rate as needed. The scheme requires no interest or physical money medium and seems fair to me.

However in fractional reserve someone deposits wealth supposedly coming from actual production. 90% of that wealth is loaned out but it is then spent on something of real value. It then finds its way back into the bank where it is loaned out again and again spent on real value. So long as the loans are actually being spent, it looks very similar to mutual credit except:

* the debit and credit are happening asynchronously
* Money growth is limited by the reserve requirement
* Interest is charged on debt

The Obama administration’s proposed overhaul of financial regulation in has enormous implications for crude and products trading. Congress is now pressed to expand and clarify the roles of regulators. Change is arriving at breakneck speed for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the Federal Trade Commission and both are taking proactive action, increasing oversight of oil markets.

But the CFTC faces a slew of challenges – how will it harmonize its regulatory approach with that of other agencies as recommended in the Obama plan? How might CFTC administer new mandates for clearing OTC derivatives? And what is its capacity to roll out these more-stringent reporting requirements?

Meanwhile, the FTC is pressing ahead with its own new stringent rules intended to monitor, prevent and punish potential manipulation of the oil markets, but how will it interact with other agencies already monitoring markets to preventing manipulation?

Understand the potential implications of these new regulations. REGISTER TODAY FOR THIS INFORMATIVE ONE-DAY CONFERENCE.

Question; If a teenager can not get part-time work yesterday, how can they possibly get work with the government mandated wage burden now in place for our business owners.

politics,I like Ike.,"What can the world, or any nation in it, hope for if no turning is found on this dread road?

The worst to be feared and the best to be expected can be simply stated. The worst is atomic war.

The best would be this: a life of perpetual fear and tension; a burden of arms draining the wealth and the labor of all peoples; a wasting of strength that defies the American system or the Soviet system or any system to achieve true abundance and happiness for the peoples of this earth.

Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.

This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.

The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.

We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat.

We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.

This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking. This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

These plain and cruel truths define the peril and point the hope that comes with this spring of 1953.

This is one of those times in the affairs of nations when the gravest choices must be made, if there is to be a turning toward a just and lasting peace.

It is a moment that calls upon the governments of the world to speak their intentions with simplicity and with honesty.

It calls upon them to answer the questions that stirs the hearts of all sane men: is there no other way the world may live?

Economics,Is the TED spread back to “normal”?,"Bloomberg's graph of the TED spread is [here](http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/cbuilder?ticker1=.TEDSP%3AIND).  This is the spread between the interest rate on 3-month Treasuries and the interest rate on 3-month Eurodollars.  The 3-month Eurodollar rate is basically the rate the large banks are willing to lend dollars to each other unsecured.  So essentially this spread is the probability the market has assigned to the chances of a large bank going bust, expressed as a premium over the rate they could get buying US Treasuries.

If you click the 5-year button, you can see it used to hang around 50bps, then when the credit crisis hit it went crazy, and when Lehman went bust it went nuts.

Now it's back down below 50bps and looking stable.  My question: is this because the market thinks things are much safer now, or is it just because everyone assumes that if a big bank came close to going bust, governments would step in and stop that happening – in which case has this once-important indicator become kind of meanlingless?  Or maybe it's a bit of both.  What do people think?",finance,2009-07-26,-0.0667241364717483

gadgets,A simpler laptop - Has anyone else thought of this?,"So I've been thinking for a while now that I would really like a simpler laptop solution. I use a netbook (Aspire One running Arch Linux), and am largely happy with it, but I don't need most of the features it has. I really would like a stripped-down machine, something that allows me to do what I need, and doesn't have to support any more. I use the shell a lot, I don't mind text-only browsers, I write anything and everything with Vim, and I prefer text based email, so really, there's not a lot I demand, and I'm SURE there are plenty more like me out there.

Basically, I'd like a Kindle-like setup, stuffed into a laptop:

* ARM processor - cut down on cost, power and heat.
* E-paper screen - major, _major_ power cut, and for the stuff I'd be using it for, who needs an lcd or whatever?
* A much lighter battery - the kindle runs for a couple days on one charge, I'd be happy with a full day.
* A decent form factor - with the lighter, smaller components, this thing could be *thin*. And using a layout like the Sony Vaio netbooks, it could be narrow, yet still have a large-ish keyboard.
* For that matter, who really needs this many keys?! Granted I use many of them, but I really think it would be possible to have the keyboard work with many less keys, just using more modifiers... I use them in my bindings anyway, to avoid having to reach some of them.
* Ditch the mouse/touch pad thing! Useless thing, always getting in my way and changing my focus. IF this machine was text only, you wouldn't need it. If it wasn't, bring back the little red nub things ThinkPads used to have (maybe still do, I can't afford one), and put the buttons on the keyboard!

I have other thoughts on this, but I'll save them for a discussion, if anyone else is interested. Would anyone else be interested in such a machine? Any thoughts on my ideas? Does one exist already?!

politics,"If a free market health insurance system can't work, why then does a free market life insurance system work?","The most common argument I hear for government-run health care is that health care operations are unexpected, expensive, and there's a chance the private health insurance company will deny coverage.  Thus, a public plan is needed.

The same logic can be applied to life insurance -- deaths are often unexpected and very expensive, and yet, you don't see life insurance companies denying coverage or dropping people.

Why is that?

Perhaps it's because our life insurance industry is a truly free market, but our health insurance industry is dominated by a few corporate giants that government helped create through the HMO act, Medicare, Medicaid, HIPAA, and dozens of other regulations.

Many new health insurance firms have tried to enter the market to compete, but failed because the state and federal bureaucrats struck them down.  Case in point:

Economics,"Katpoop10's Weekly Rant Wednesday, July 29th, 2009","*This weeks' topic is the Federal Reserve*

As many of you are no doubt aware, there is a debate regarding the Fed's ""independence"".

The argument can be summarized as the following:

Pro: The Fed should have independence from Congress because it is held that both theory and history show that independent central banks are better able to ""control"" inflation and overall employment.

Con: The Fed has powers that extend throughout the entire economy, as such, they should be subject to oversight.

Now, the debate seems to hinge on one single identifiable factor.  Namely, an independent central bank is better than a non-independent central bank.

The argument put forward by the Fed and its supporters is that both theory and history have shown that a central bank that is under too much influence of elected government always tends to be not as efficient nor as capable of controlling inflation as one that is independent.

Let us explore this claim in more detail.

Fed chief Ben Bernanke has recently gone on a road trip to convince the public that HR 1207 is not just an audit bill.  It is a bill that would allegedly jeopardize the Fed's independence from Congress.  Bernanke claims that without independence, the Fed won't be able to control inflation and interest rates, which presumably are key control factors that encourage economic growth.

So does this defense hold any water?  Upon closer inspection, the answer is most certainly no.

For what is the Fed's argument for independence from Congress?  The Fed claims that without independence, elected officials will be tempted to increase the quantity of money and create price inflation because of the inherent nature of politics and elections.  The Fed claims that if Congress were in charge of the money supply, the Congressman's 2 year terms would give them great incentives to buy votes by increasing he supply of money and using that money to bribe the public, as it were.  

The Fed claims that it is above such myopic behavior.  The Fed claims that since the Fed is independent from government, it is able to consider more long term horizons and goals, and thus keep the monetary system in a more ""stable"" configuration.

But has anyone actually put forward a detailed theory as to the validity of such claims?  Typically, the basis for such claims derives solely from the idea that separation of powers leads to more efficient outcomes.

Let us expand this idea of ""independence leading to more efficient outcomes"" and apply it to the monetary system itself.  

Is it logical and rational to think that the Fed is inherently immune to the temptations that they accuse Congress of suffering from?  I think the answer to this question is decidedly no.  The purpose of the Fed is to be the lender of last resort, which means that it stands ready to loan new money to any bank that it feels needs it.

Now, in such an environment, can the Fed really claim that it is more prudent in handling the money supply, especially when its banks can and do suffer massive crises, which seem to require bailouts, i.e. inflation?

It seems as though the Fed can't claim that it is better at handling monetary matters than government because they are ""inflicted"" with the same fallibility as Congress, namely, they too are run by mortal men, who have desires and wants and passions.  

If the whole point of ""independent"" central banks is that it allows for more stable monetary policy, on the basis of the Fed having the privilege of not succumbing to political pressures to increase the supply of money, then does this mean that the Fed has no incentive whatsoever to increase the supply of money?

I think the answer to this is no.  Just look at how much money the Fed has created in the last year.  It has more than doubled the supply of reserves.  Think about that.  In that last year, the Fed has created more money than it has in its entire 86 year history.  Can it really claim that it is not subject to the same pressures to increase the supply of money as Congress?

What the Fed and its supporters overlook is that the reason temptations to print money exists is because the power to print money exists.

If Congress suffers from fallibility, than doesn't the Fed as well?  After all, the Fed is made up of humans just like Congress.  Is it really logical and rational to assume that the Fed is somehow able to overcome the urge to print money whereas the government cannot?  

I have never seen an argument that conclusively proves that the people at the Fed are immune to the pressures to print money whereas Congress is not immune.

Now, having said all this, wouldn't it be logical and rational to support a monetary system that is immune to the pressures of both Congress and the Fed, and every other individual's whims?  Wouldn't the best monetary system be one that even the Fed admits must not be under the control of people who are not fit to run it, and be as independent as it can possibly be?

I think that the people at the Fed are inherently no better than the people in Congress.  

For this reason, the best monetary system is one that is not susceptible to either the Fed's or the government's myopia.  Of course I am talking about a 100% reserve gold standard.  A gold standard is even more ""independent"" than an ""independent"" central bank!  It is ""independent"" from the whims of every man on Earth.  The argument that the Fed uses to convince the public that it should be independent from Congress applies no less to the Fed itself when comparing fiat to gold.",finance,2009-07-29,0.0205071038350544

Dear Chief Tollett,

On Thursday July 30th at 4pm I was stopped on I-10, west of the Chew Rd. exit by K-9 Officer Gum and Sgt. Riske. Upon stopping Officer Gum asked me to exit the vehicle and come to the rear of my van. Officer Gum informed me that he stopped my vehicle for swerving across the lanes. Gum then asked if it (my swerving) was due to the wind. I disagreed that I had been swerving and the only times that I crossed the line was when properly using my turn signal to change lanes. Officer Gum then asked if it was ok for my vehicle to be searched. I stated that I did not consent to any searches.

Officer Gum instructed me to stand on the side of the road next to Sgt. Riske while he went to his police vehicle and retrieved his K9 dog. As Officer Gum approached my vehicle I again stated to Sgt. Riske that I do not consent to any searches. I also asked if I could follow Officer Gum and the K9 to ensure that the officer did not falsely alert the dog for the presence of any weapons or contraband. Sgt. Riske said I could not.

After Officer Gum walked the K9 around my vehicle he informed me that the dog had alerted to the presence of narcotics. At no time did I observe the K9 dog perform any movement outside of its base behavior of walking around the vehicle and sniffing at the spots on my vehicle that Officer Gum had touched. At no time did I see the K9 sit and alert to or jump up and further investigate/touch any area of my vehicle. I believe the video from the police vehicle will show the fact that the K9 did not alert to the presence of narcotics in my vehicle. In conversation with Sgt. Riske he confirmed that the video was turned on by Officer Gum.

Officer Gum then opened the passenger’s door to my vehicle. I shouted to him that I do not consent to any searches. He told me to “shut up” and to remain standing where I was. I informed Sgt. Riske of my concern that Officer Gum would discover my medications and therefore violate my right to my medical privacy. Sgt. Riske asked me what medications I took and I responded that was my own private medical information. I also informed Sgt. Riske that none of my medications were in the class of narcotics.

Officer Gum then opened the side doors of my vehicle and had the dog enter the back of my vehicle. Officer Gum then opened my black leather computer bag that was sitting right at the entrance to the side doors of my van. Officer Gum then opened my computer bag and inspected my multiple medication bottles that I store in that bag. At no time did I observe the K9 react or alert to my computer bag or anything else inside my vehicle.

Officer Gum completed his search and approached me after securing his K9 dog back in his police vehicle. I asked Officer Gum if he discovered any narcotics in my vehicle and he confirmed that he did not but he stated that there were narcotics in my vehicle previously. Sgt. Riske also stated that there were narcotics in my vehicle previously. I informed both that there were not any narcotics in my vehicle at any time. I also informed Officer Gum that I believe he violated my right to medical privacy by his inspection of my medications and therefore obtaining knowledge of my personal medical conditions. Officer Gum then returned my drivers’ license and both officers departed the area without issuing me any warning or citation.

I ask that the Sealy Police department preserve all video and audio recordings of this incident. In accordance with my rights under the Freedom of Information Act I ask that a copy of these video and audio recordings be sent to me as well as all other information and files that the Sealy Police Department has in regards to me.

I ask that the Sealy Police Department conduct a full investigation of this incident and take appropriate disciplinary actions against Officer Gum and Sgt. Riske. I ask that all county, state and federal authorities that receive this letter conduct a full criminal investigation into the conduct of Officer Gum and Sgt. Riske. I also ask that a full review of the policies and practices of the Sealy Police Department be conducted.

It is my contention that Officer Gum and Sgt. Riske knowingly and intentionally violated my rights against unreasonable search and seizure as well as my right to medical privacy. I do not believe the officers even had a valid reason for stopping me. This will be evidenced by the videotape recording from the police vehicle and the absence of any valid traffic violation. I further contend that the officers illegally searched my vehicle as evidenced from the police vehicle video and by the K9 dog’s failure to properly alert to any weapons or contraband in my vehicle even though Officer Gum claimed otherwise.

My medical privacy was violated by Sgt. Riske failing to act on my concern regarding my medical privacy and Officer Gum directly violated my medical privacy by inspecting my computer bag and medications even though the K9 did not alert to the bag.

I further ask that Officer Gum, Sgt. Riske and the Sealy Police Department provide a logical reason behind their statements that narcotics were once present in my vehicle even though no narcotics had been found and no evidence had been provided of the previous presence of narcotics. If Sgt. Riske and Officer Gum have been properly trained in the use of K9 dogs then they would be fully aware that a K9’s detection accuracy is less than 50%. (Illinois v. Caballes, 543 U.S. 405 (2005), Justice Souter, ""dogs in artificial testing situations return false positives anywhere from 12.5% to 60% of the time…”). Knowing this, the officers therefore had no logical basis for their claims about my vehicle or me. I consider their claims to be slander and damaging to my reputation as well as my future residency in Texas.

worldnews,Nigeria on the brink,"Four days of violence in Nigeria have left hundreds dead, destroyed towns and villages across the north, brought the cold-blooded police shooting of an Islamist rabble-rouser and left the outside world horrified. Nigeria, with 140 million people, is Africa’s largest country. It is also one of the most corrupt, unstable, unequal and fissiparous: in half a century of independence it has seen civil wars, separatist rebellions, military coups, ethnic vendettas and a terrible descent into virtual ungovernability. What happens in Nigeria matters not only to Africa: it affects the huge diaspora in Britain, distorts the oil market, drives international criminality and opens the gates to extremism and terrorism.

The latest violence comes after an uprising by a bizarre Islamist sect, Boko Haram, that urged followers in several northern states to attack police stations, prisons and churches and burn down schools in an attempt to enforce extreme Sharia and rid the country of all Western education. This is not the first such uprising in the north or the only time that militants,who model themselves on the Afghan Taleban, have clashed with federal authority. At least 10,000 people have been killed in sectarian clashes since the Government, attempting to appease the growing current of Islamic extremism after years of military dictatorship, allowed 12 of the northern states to proclaim Sharia. But President Yar’Adua now sees the very unity of Nigeria at stake. After a warning this week that the sect was preparing to unleash ""holy war"", he ordered troops to eradicate Boko Haram once and for all.

The order has been carried out with indiscriminate brutality. House-to-house searches, gun battles and helicopter searches have killed sect members in scores. Their leader, a university dropout with a violent agenda and views so benighted that he asserted the world was flat and rain was not caused by evaporation but by Allah, was caught in a goats’ pen, and shot dead by police after begging for mercy. It is not only his followers who are outraged: many Nigerians and human rights activists have warned of inevitable reprisals and exacerbation of the nation’s religious divide.

The uprising, however, is just a symptom of the social breakdown that has made Nigeria so prone to violence. Rampant corruption has undermined even the feeble central government efforts to tackle social inequality, failing health and education systems, the stinking detritus burying most big cities and widespread unemployment. The oil boom has only exacerbated corruption and inequality, and the dreadful conditions in the Niger Delta have spawned an endemic rebellion, regular kidnappings and crime syndicates that siphon off so much oil that total production is running at millions of barrels below capacity.

Into this maelstrom have stepped Islamist extremists. Al-Qaeda has identified Nigeria as fertile ground for its nihilist message, just as it saw Somalia, another failing African state, as a new base for its operations. It is swiftly spreading the jihadist message, exploiting the unease over Sharia by pushing for the most extremist interpretation and recruiting Nigerians as new agents to infiltrate Western society. This is extremely alarming. There is a large Nigerian community in most European countries, and an especially big one in Britain. Already there are fears that organised crime is exploiting the link to racketeering. If al-Qaeda can recruit sleepers among still largely moderate Muslims living in the West, the security services have a nightmare on their hands.

Nigerians are desperate to see better government in Abuja. The onus is now on President Yar’Adua to overcome doubts about his democratic legitimacy, grasp the urgency of Nigeria’s situation and save a failing state before he is swept away by violence, despair or another coup.

politics,On a brains-driven discussion of US health-care reform?,"Reddit is currently abuzz with discussions of the US HCR, being mostly for it and against the current system, widely considered broken.

However the ""discussion"", as far as I can see, hinges mostly on ""health care reform good, current system bad"" without much discussion about what the reform *could* lead to (apart from the White House's plan and single-payer).

Among the 33 ""advanced economies"" countries recognized by the IMF, most have some form of universal health coverage system. But interestingly, I don't think two of them have exactly the same one.

What reddit could do here is unleash its endless energy for proving other people wrong (on the internet) and bickering endlessly and compile description of the health-care systems of first-world countries, something along the lines of

1. when it was created in its current form  
2. why (and what was the previous system, if any)  
4. what's the status of insurers if they exist  
5. what's the status of doctors if they exist, and their train of living (specialists or not)  
6. how is the country's government involved in health care if it is at all  
6. what are the interactions between the players of the system, other than those put in the points above?  
7. how is the system seen? By insiders? By outsiders? By specialists of policy/health care  
8. what are the results of the system in terms of health-care metrics? Base care and advanced care?  
9. are there any obvious failings to it?  
10. anything else you can think of to allow people to understand how that country's health care system works (or doesn't)  
11. is there any actual possibility that the US could switch to such a system? Starting at the federal level? Starting at the state level? And why?

I really think this could serve as an interesting resource not just for reddit discussions, but for internet HCR discussions in general and even for ""real life"" HCR discussions, including with your elected representatives (if you live in the US). Plus it might help engage those who are currently in the ""let's not change anything"" camp: a discussion starts with facts, and the facts of all other first-world countries in the world is as good as it gets on such a subject.",energy,2009-08-06,-0.0123663156954473

Economics,For your consideration: A third option to the health insurance problem,"Okay, so this is an idea I've been tossing around for a few days now.  First off, though, a quick refresher on the problem:

The problem is that health care for major injuries, as the industry exists right now, is something that the majority of citizens may need but cannot afford.  As of now, two primary solutions have been proposed to this problem.

The first is the heath insurance industry as it currently stands - companies are paid monthly sums, in exchange for a contractual agreement to pay for medical expenses incurred.

The problems with this approach are widely known.  Namely that what has happened thus far is that the companies end up being in the business of not paying claims, and due to the prohibitive investment required to start one, competition has yet to solve the problem.

The other approach is socialized health care, in which the government serves the same function.  I dislike this approach for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that federal bureaucracy has a nasty habit of absorbing large percentages of the money it processes.  


So, I present to you a modest proposal for a third solution to the problem.  

A group of, say, a hundred individuals get together and create a bank account containing a certain fraction of their net worth (alternatively, a loan could be taken out collectively, and paid off over several years).  A charter is drawn up by community consensus (including notes on how the charter may be revised) regarding under what circumstance money may be paid out of the account.  The function would be, from the consumer's end, much the same as standard health insurance: a (smaller) monthly check is sent out, and, in the event of catastrophic injury, they are given money to pay for whatever surgery or care they require.

The difference is that in this case, the motivations line up - each member of the collective has a motivation to ensure that the charter is strict enough to avoid being scammed (as their money is in there too), but they also have a motivation to ensure that it is fair (as they may need it at some point).  Plus, because it wouldn't be a for-profit entity, overhead would be negligible.

The best part is that anyone could start one, with no government intervention to speak of.  If you didn't like yours, you could withdraw your original investment and go join a better one.

So, what does Reddit think?  Any thought/suggestions/actual legal opinions on the matter?",finance,2009-08-10,-0.0245742490814239

programming,"Dear Programming Reddit, I am in need of some career advice.","I graduated from my local technical college with a two year diploma in Computer Engineering Technology. Upon graduation I took up a position with the federal government largely because it was the highest paying of the four positions I was offered. During my time here I have found that the working conditions are nearly suffocating because of the sheer amount of bureaucracy and red tape that you need to go to in order to get anything done, as well as I have found the the programmers that I work with are downright hostile to the idea of  trying to modernize anything despite the fact that they are currently considering their retirement packages. The above factors have led me to start looking for a new job and I have recently had two opportunities present themselves.

The first opportunity is with a local fairly large University. It is a job as a web application developer and is working with newer technologies and doing some consulting and analyst work which would be a nice break from riding the desk. This job also comes with a raise in pay.

The second job is working for a smaller tech company that provides a online tv publishing framework. This company employs 30 people and has been running for four years (I take this to mean that they are at least some what stable) and has a bit of a reputation for hiring younger hot shot programmers(take that as you will, as either a good or a bad reputation). In talking with this company it has become clear however that I would have to take a cut in pay of anywhere from 10% to 20%.

So what do you guys think, maybe give me some perspectives from people who have already tried these options.

politics,My grandma sent me this email about healthcare. I'd like to thoroughly refute it and send it back.,"As a physician who has authored books on preventative health care, I was given the opportunity to be the keynote speaker at a Congressional Dinner at The Capitol Building in Washington last Friday (7/17). The presentation was entitled Health Care Reform, The Power &amp; Profit of Prevention, and I was gratified that it was well received.
In preparation for the presentation, I read the latest version of ""reform"" as authored by The Obama Administration and supported by Speaker Pelosi and Senator Reid. Here is the link to the 1,018 page document:
(http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf)
Let me summarize just a few salient points of the above plan. First,
however, it should be clear that the same warning notice must be placed on The ObamaCare Plan as on a pack of cigarettes: Consuming this product will be hazardous to your health.

The underlying method of cutting costs throughout the plan is based on rationing and denying care. There is no focus on preventing health care need whatever. The plan's method is the most inhumane and unethical approach to cutting costs I can imagine as a physician.
The rationing of care is implemented through The National Health Care
Board, according to the plan. This illustrious Board ""will approve or reject treatment for patients based on the cost per treatment divided by the number of years the patient will benefit from the treatment.""
Translation.....if you are over 65 or have been recently diagnosed as
having an advanced form of cardiac disease or aggressive cancer.....dream on if you think you will get treated......pick out your coffin.
 
 
Oh, you say this could never happen? Sorry..... this is the same model
they use in Britain. The plan mandates that there will be little or no advanced treatments to be available in the future. It creates The Federal Coordinating Council For Comparative Effectiveness Research, the purpose of which is ""to slow the development of new medications and technologies in order to reduce costs.""
Yes, this is to be the law. The plan also outlines that doctors and hospitals will be overseen and reviewed by The National Coordinator For Health Information and Technology.

This "" coordinator"" will ""monitor treatments being delivered to make sure doctors and hospitals are strictly following government guidelines that are deemed appropriate."" It goes on to say......""Doctors and hospitals not adhering to guidelines will face penalties.""
According to those in Congress, penalties could include large six figure
financial fines and possible imprisonment.

So according to The ObamaCare Plan....if your doctor saves your life you might have to go to the prison to see your doctor for follow -up
appointments. I believe this is the same model Stalin used in the former Soviet Union.
 

Section 102 has the Orwellian title, ""Protecting the Choice to Keep
Current Coverage."" What this section really mandates is that it is illegal to keep your private insurance if your status changes - e.g., if you lose or change your job, retire from your job and become a senior, graduate from college and get your first job. Yes, illegal.

When Mr. Obama hosted a conference call with bloggers urging them to pressure Congress to pass his health plan as soon as possible, a blogger from Maine referenced an Investors Business Daily article that claimed Section 102 of the House health legislation would outlaw private insurance. He asked: ""Is this true? Will people be able to keep their insurance and will insurers be able to write new policies even though H.R. 3200 is passed?"" Mr. Obama replied: ""You know, I have to say that I am not familiar with the provision you are talking about.""
 

Then there is Section 1233 of The ObamaCare Plan, devoted to ""Advanced Care Planning."" After each American turns 65 years of age they have to go to a mandated counseling program that is designed to end life sooner. This session is to occur every 5 years unless the person has developed a chronic illness then it must be done every year. The topics in this session will include, ""how to decline hydration, nutrition and how to initiate hospice care."" It is no wonder The Obama Administration does not like my emphasis on Prevention For Mr. Obama, prevention is the ""enemy"" as people would live longer.

I rest my case. The ObamaCare Plan is hazardous to the health of every American. After I finished my Capitol Hill presentation, I was asked by a Congressman in the question-answer session: ""I'll be doing a number of network interviews on the Obama Health Care Plan. If I am asked 'what is the one word to describe the plan?' what should I answer?"" The answer is simple, honest, direct, analytical, sad but truthful. I told him that one word is FASCIST. Then I added, ""I hope you'll have the courage to use that word, Congressman. No other word is more appropriate.""",finance,2009-08-12,-0.0167901530730006

ObamaCare and me
By Zane F Pollard, MD


I have been sitting quietly on the sidelines watching all of this national debate on healthcare. It is time for me to bring some clarity to the table by explaining many of the problems from the perspective of a doctor.

First off, the government has involved very few of us physicians in the healthcare debate. While the American Medical Association has come out in favor of the plan, it is vital to remember that the AMA only represents 17% of the American physician workforce.

I have taken care of Medicaid patients for 35 years while representing the only pediatric ophthalmology group left in Atlanta, Georgia that accepts Medicaid. For example, in the past 6 months I have cared for three young children on Medicaid who had corneal ulcers. This is a potentially blinding situation because if the cornea perforates from the infection, almost surely blindness will occur. In all three cases the antibiotic needed for the eradication of the infection was not on the approved Medicaid list.

Each time I was told to fax Medicaid for the approval forms, which I did. Within 48 hours the form came back to me which was sent in immediately via fax, and I was told that I would have my answer in 10 days. Of course by then each child would have been blind in the eye.

Each time the request came back denied. All three times I personally provided the antibiotic for  each patient which was not on the Medicaid approved  list. Get the point -- rationing of care.

Over the past 35 years I have cared for over 1000 children born with congenital cataracts. In older children and in adults the vision is rehabilitated with an intraocular lens. In newborns we use contact lenses which are very expensive. It takes Medicaid over one year to approve a contact lens post  cataract surgery. By that time a successful anatomical operation is wasted as the child will be close to blind from a lack of focusing for so long a period of time.

Again, extreme rationing. Solution: I have a foundation here in Atlanta supported  100% by private funds which supplies all of these contact lenses for  my Medicaid and illegal immigrants children for free. Again, waiting for the government would be disastrous.

Last week I  had a lady bring her child to me. They are Americans but live in Sweden, as the father has a job with a big corporation. The child had the onset of double vision 3 months ago and has been unable to function normally because of this. They are people of means but are waiting 8 months to see the ophthalmologist in Sweden. Then if the child needed surgery they would be put on a 6 month waiting list. She called me and I saw her that day. It turned out that  the child had  accommodative esotropia (crossing of the eyes treated with glasses that  correct for farsightedness) and  responded to glasses within  4 days, so no surgery was needed. Again, rationing of care.

Last month I operated on a 70 year old lady with double vision present for 3  years. She responded quite nicely to her surgery and now is symptom free. I also operated on a 69 year old  judge with vertical double vision. His surgery went very well and now he is happy as a lark.  I have  been told -- but of course  there is no healthcare bill that has been passed yet -- that these  2 people because of their age would have  been denied  surgery and just told to wear a patch over one eye to alleviate the symptoms of double vision. Obviously cheaper than surgery.

I spent two year  in the  US Navy during the Viet Nam war and was well treated by the military. There was tremendous  rationing of care and we were told specifically what things the military personnel and their dependents could have and which things they could not have. While I was in Viet Nam, my wife Nancy got sick  and got essentially no care at the Naval Hospital in Oakland, California. She went home and went to her family's  private internist in Beverly Hills. While it was expensive, she received an immediate work up. Again rationing of care.

For those of you who are  over 65, this  bill in its present form might be lethal for you. People in England over 59 cannot receive stents for their coronary arteries. The government wants to mimic the British  plan. For those of you younger, it will still mean restriction of the care that you and your children receive.

While 99% of physicians went into  medicine because of the love of  medicine and the  challenge of helping our fellow man, economics are still important. My rent goes up 2% each year and the salaries of my employees go up 2% each year. Twenty years ago, ophthalmologists were  paid $1800 for a cataract surgery and today $500. This is a 73%  decrease in our  fees. I do not know of many jobs in America that have seen this sort of lowering of fees.

But there is more to the story than just the lower fees. When I came to Atlanta, there was a well known ophthalmologist that charged $2500 for a cataract surgery as he felt the was the best. He had a terrific reputation and in fact  I had my mother's bilateral cataracts  operated on by him with a wonderful result. She is now 94 and has 20/20 vision in both eyes. People would pay his  $2500 fee.

However, then the government came in and said that any doctor that  does  Medicare work cannot accept  more than the going rate ( now $500) or  he or she would be  severely fined. This put an end to his charging  $2500. The government said it was illegal to accept more than the government-allowed  rate.. What  I am driving at is that those of you well off  will not  be able to go to the head of the line under this new  healthcare plan, just because you have money, as no physician will be  willing to go against the law to treat  you.

I am a pediatric ophthalmologist and trained for  10 years post-college to become a pediatric ophthalmologist (add  two years  of my service in the Navy and that comes  to 12 years).A neurosurgeon spends 14  years post -college, and if  he or she has to do the military that would be 16 years. I am not entitled to make what a neurosurgeon makes, but the new plan calls for all physicians to make the same amount of payment. I assure you that medical students will not go into neurosurgery and we will have a tremendous shortage of neurosurgeons. Already, the top neurosurgeon at my hospital who is in good health and only 52 years old has just quit because he can't stand working with the government anymore. Forty-nine percent  of children under the age  of 16 in the state of Georgia are on Medicaid, so he felt he just could not stand working with the bureaucracy anymore.

We are being lied to about the  uninsured. They are getting care. I operate  at least 2  illegal immigrants each month who pay me nothing, and the children's hospital at which I operate charges them nothing also.This is true not only on Atlanta, but of every community in America.

The bottom line is that I urge all of you to contact your congresswomen and congressmen and senators to defeat this bill. I promise you that you will not like rationing of your own health.

Furthermore, how can you trust a physician that works under these conditions knowing that he is controlled by the state. I certainly could not trust any doctor that would work under these  draconian conditions.

One last thing: with this new healthcare plan there will be a tremendous shortage of physicians. It has been estimated that  approximately 5% of the current physician work force  will quit under this new  system. Also it is estimated that another 5% shortage will occur because of the decreased number of men and women wanting to go into medicine. At the present time the US government has  mandated gender equity in  admissions to medical schools .That means that  for the past  15 years  that somewhere  between 49 and 51% of  each entering class are females. This is true of private schools also, because all private schools receive federal funding.

The average  career of a woman in medicine now is only 8-10 years and the average work week for a female in medicine is only 3-4 days. I have now trained 35  fellows in pediatric ophthalmology. Hands down the  best was  a female that I trained  4 years  ago -- she  was head and  heels above all  others I have trained. She now practices  only 3 days a week.",finance,2009-08-12,-0.1711795422675511

politics,"What's going on with China, and why both of us need Ron Paul","You see, what happened is that Chain's central planners printed up a bunch of credit and loaned it into factories and infrastructure, while the USA central planners pumped it into houses and strip malls.  The misallocations of capital are sure to nail both of us hard, but after the blood bath (IMHO) the free market will find China's factories more useful than the USA's houses.  Therefore China will rise in relation to the USA.  (don't know if they'll overtake us, that remains to be seen).  To relieve the pressure of the housing bubble, we would be wise to open the immigration flood gates which would increase real free market demand for houses, but I doubt we will. 

In addition, China will not feel pressure to drive their economy into the dirt with ""new deal"" type programs because they have trillions of US treasuries in their reserves.  Instead we will pay for their ""new deal"".  Also, I think short of a major trend change, China will not return to more socialism.  They must create 10 million jobs per year to hold off a mass peasant revolt, and the only way to do that is the free market.  They already tried land reform in the 60's and other socialist ""solutions"", and it caused 30 million people to die of starvation and the government to nearly collapse under revolt.  I don't think they can go back that direction ever again even if they wanted to (and they do). 

If we get a Ron Paul type in over here, the USA will birth into the information age and move onto the next generation of freedom and free markets.  It would benefit both the USA and China.  If we don't China will likely continue to rise in proportion to the USA, and the USA will likely descend into another socialist pig-sty like France.

I wonder if we can get China to back a Ron Paul like political revolt over here.  After all, killing the federal reserve is the only chance they've got to keep the USA from turning it's dollars into toilet paper.  He doesn't want anything to do with Taiwan or Tibet foreign affairs, and he called the US house ""Tienanmen square resolution ""hypocritical.  I bet they could even work out a deal here to send over immigrants. We've got plenty of houses for them, and I'm sure China would just love the chance to ease up on their 10 million per year job quota.",finance,2009-08-13,0.2443742858443781

for a public option in health care reform, he sent 
me this letter in response. What are good counter-
arguments?","Dear Mr. redditor(name redacted):

Thank you for your recent letter regarding national health care reform. As you know, President Obama has announced his intention to sign a health care reform bill into law before the end of this year. 

I agree that our health care system is broken and in need of real, substantive reform. I share your concern about the rising cost of health insurance and the increasing number of Americans that are unable to afford quality health care, and I am commited to working on health care initiatives that will address this problem. 

I believe that proposals centering on government-run health care are troubling because they would put the government between doctors and patients, compromising patient choice and access to care. Implementing a ""public plan option"" that allows individuals to op-in to a government-managed health plan would create a multitrillion-dollar entitlement program that would greatly expand the role of the federal government in every aspect of the health care industry. 

Many health experts contend that instead of reducing costs and increasing the quality of care, a public option health care plan that follows the Medicare model would instead lead to a drastic decrease in payments to doctors and hospitals. The costs for these underpayments have long been shifted onto private payers in the form of higher charges. However, experts contend that 119 million Americans--fully two-thirds of the 170 million Americans that currently are covered by private insurance--would abandon private coverage in favor of lower costs promised by a government-run option. Doctors, nurses, and hostpitals would be forced to see more patients with reduced pay--hardly a model of successful reform. 

I recognize that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach is insufficiant to address the varying medical situations of all Americans. Therefore, I do not believe that a subsidized government health plan that would crowd out private insurance and eliminate market competition--leaving government-run health coverage as the only alternative--is the best way forward. Instead, we must rely on ideas that ensure patients, not government bureaucrats, are in charge of their health care. 

Please be assured that I will keep your views on this important subject in mind as my colleagues and I consider health care legislation in the coming weeks and months. 

Thank you again for writing. Your comments and suggestions are always welcome. 

Very truly yours, 

Jeff Sessions
United States Senator

So this means it would cost ~ $475 Billion to cover the entire US. We already spend $511 Billion on Medicare/Medicaid per year.,"For the Tricare North award:  https://www.fbo.gov/index?&amp;s=opportunity&amp;mode=form&amp;id=f4d66a09e5dc64976c39d36c8983a961&amp;tab=core&amp;tabmode=list

Tricare North was won by Aetna, Tricare South was won by United Healthcare, and Tricare West was won by BCBS (Triwest was spun off of BCBS, not exactly sure on how it's all set up).

To get the total number of beneficiaries, go to http://tricare.mil/Transparency/.  In the dropdown box for 'High Quality and Efficiency' I used the beneficiary numbers for Prime, Standard/Extra, and Reserve Select.  TRICARE For Life is a Medicare supplement for retirees of the military and there spouses, so I've excluded it.

Now, for my calculations.  I added up the contract awards, which total $55,462,283,183.  Divide that by 5 (the length of the contracts in years) and you get $11,092,456,636.60 per year.  Next, divide 300,000,000 (U.S. population) by 7,000,000 (members covered by TRICARE) and you find that the total is 42.86.  Take 42.86 and multiply it by $11,092,456,636.60 and you come up with $475,422,691,445 as the cost of covering 300 million people.

According to http://useconomy.about.com/od/fy2008budget/p/2008_Mandatory.htm we are already spending $511,000,000,000 on medicare and medicaid (FY08 numbers) alone.  

Isn't it time we give TRICARE to everyone, a big fat gigantic raise to people in the military, and allow retired military members and spouses to live a nice quiet life without worrying about money or medical problems ever again.  Isn't opposing something like this unpatriotic, especially to the troops?  George Bush used this line, so why can't anyone?  The only difference is it would be used for good, not evil.  This needs to be the the first plank of our battle cry when we discuss fixing healthcare.  The second, and arguably more important, but less sexy part of our battle cry is to use supreme court decision Kelo vs. City of New London, CT to transfer ownership of all private, for profit healthcare facilities to the public to speed the recovery of our economy and to lower healthcare costs of the program.

Finally, fun facts about TRICARE. Abortions are covered under TRICARE if the health of the mother is at risk if carried to term.  Medically necessary services are covered as long as they are approved by the FDA.  However, some services are specifically excluded from TRICARE, but I couldn't find the list.  If any research monkeys want to find it, search at manuals.tricare.osd.mil.  There are still preauthorizations required, but can be obtained retroactively.  The first 8 visits for mental healthcare coverage are covered.  Oh, and prescription copays are $3 for generic and $9 for name brand.

politics,Here is my Congressman's response to my request that he support single payer universal,"Dear Mr Araby:
 
Thank you for contacting me to express your support for President Obama's health care plan. Access to quality health care is a critical issue facing our country, and I appreciate your input.
 
America has the highest quality health care in the world. A recent medical study on cancer survivability rates showed that Americans are in a lot better shape than Great Britain, Norway, and the European Union nations, all of which have government run health care.  For example, the survival rate for those diagnosed with prostate cancer in European Union countries is only 77%; it is 99% in the U.S.  Additionally, all female cases of cancer have a survivability rate of 62.9% in the United States, but only 52.7% in England. 
 
However, like you, I agree that our healthcare costs too much. Lawsuit abuse, government regulations, and abuse of our programs by illegal aliens have caused health care costs to spiral out of control, and these costs increased the financial burden on American families. Health care reform should address access and cost, but not at the expense of our current quality. Congress must act soon or health care costs will continue to increase as a percentage of our Gross Domestic Product (GDP). 
 
I am opposed to a government run health care plan for several reasons.  First, there is the matter of cost. Cost estimates for the Democratic health care plan range as high as $2 trillion, much of which will have to be paid for in the form of new debt and increased taxes.  These high cost estimates are unacceptable, especially since the Obama administration has incurred more debt than all other Presidential administrations combined. 
 
In addition to the high costs, a government run insurance plan would eventually force people out of their current plans. All last fall, President Obama promised that any reform legislation would allow Americans to keep their individual coverage. However, under the Democrats' plan, Americans with private insurance would be forced to drop their coverage in favor of a government run plan. 
 
One of the reasons Americans will be forced to drop their coverage is because the Democrats' plan would establish a Health Exchange. The Health Exchange would regulate all private insurance plans and mandate what procedures are covered and how much physicians are reimbursed. Employers would also be forced to either participate in the exchange or pay a tax. Insurers will have to drop people due to the increased cost of their plan to comply with the exchange. This is why experts have predicted that as many as 120 million Americans will lose their current coverage.
 
President Obama is misleading the American people on health care access and choices by saying that with a public option plan, Americans can keep their current coverage. However, Representative Barney Frank, a democrat from Massachusetts, was quoted admitting the ultimate goal of the Democrats' healthcare plan. He said, ""If we get a good public option it could lead to single payer, and the only way to get to a single payer plan is to have a public option.""
 
In addition to the outrageous costs and Americans' inevitable loss of their current coverage, the quality of healthcare will be drastically affected. This will lead to healthcare rationing. The healthcare plan would create a new government board, the Health Benefits Advisory Council. The purpose of this board would be to mandate treatments and benefits under health insurance plans. Essentially, this board would authorize federal bureaucrats to determine what health care you receive, taking these decisions away from you and your doctor.  Since the government would be overburdened with costs, to control spending, it would ration care, just as governments have in every other country with a government run plan. As you can see, this ""public option"" would leave individuals with less access to health care and government bureaucrats making the decisions.
 
So far, I have explained how the healthcare plan is flawed and identified the reasons I do not support it. I want you to know that Republicans have solutions and are committed to reducing the cost of healthcare. We would provide incentives to make coverage affordable and increase access to physician care by enacting reasonable limits on frivolous medical lawsuits. Republicans would encourage states to improve their insurance markets in order to reduce mandates that drive up costs and increase the number of uninsured Americans. Also, we would encourage states to expand state coverage for chronically ill individuals and those with pre-existing conditions in order to guarantee access to quality coverage. 
 
In addition to these solutions, we would encourage healthy lifestyles by allowing employers to offer discounts and other incentives for their participants in wellness programs. We would ensure that individuals currently enrolled in Medicaid have the option to apply the value of their current health benefit towards coverage that best meets their needs. By providing incentives to individuals, we can encourage people to accumulate funds to pay for medical expenses through Health Savings Accounts (HSAs). Understanding that people need to have more access to information about price and quality of medical treatments, we would make this data more available so Americans are confident and informed about their healthcare decisions. All in all, Republicans will do what we can to keep the government from standing in the way of life-saving treatments on cost grounds and permit Americans to choose the healthcare plan that is best for them.
 
As your elected Representative, I am familiar with how crucial health care coverage is to our quality of life.  That is why I am committed to true reform, which would keep costs low, respect the patient-physician relationship, and ensure that health care decisions are not made by the government or insurance companies. I cannot support a proposal that would throw money at the problem, create a government run system that would encourage waste, fraud, abuse, and limit health care access.  Please know that I will work with my colleagues to create a better reform plan.
 
Thank you again for allowing me to address this important issue.  If I can be of further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.
 
For your information, I have attached facts regarding the following discredited claims the President repeated in his press conference on July 22.
 
CLAIM: ""I have also pledged that health insurance reform will not add to our deficit over the next decade - and I mean it.""
 
FACT:  Recently, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released its cost estimate on the House Democrats' legislation and found that it will increase the federal budget deficit by $239 billion over the next 10 years.  And as the Associated Press noted: ""Congressional Budget Office Director Douglas Elmendorf warned lawmakers the legislation that he has seen so far would raise costs, not lower them. Elmendorf was asked by Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-N.S., if the bills Congress is considering would 'bend the cost curve.' The budget director responded: 'The curve is being raised.'"" 
 
CLAIM: ""If you already have health insurance, the reform we're proposing will provide you with more security and more stability.  It will keep government out of health care decisions, giving you the option to keep your insurance if you're happy with it.""
FACT: Both the Associated Press and ABC News have already debunked this pledge, noting that White House officials have acknowledged the president's rhetoric shouldn't be taken ""literally.""  The Congressional Budget Office found that 23 million Americans would lose their current plans if the Senate Democratic health care ""reform"" bill becomes law.  Worse yet, an independent study conducted by the Lewin Group predicted that 114 million Americans would be forced out of their current health care coverage, including more than 106 million Americans who currently have employer-provided health care. 
 
CLAIM: ""We will pass reform that lowers cost, promotes choice, and provides coverage that every American can count on.  And we will do it this year.""
 
FACT:  Congress should pursue meaningful health care reform, but none of the legislation that Democratic leaders are pursuing at this time actually meet this description.  Instead, their proposals will increase costs, lower quality, and cause millions of Americans to lose their current health coverage. 
 
CLAIM: ""This isn't about me.  I have great health insurance, and so does every Member of Congress.""
 
FACT: In early July, Democrats on the House Ways &amp; Means Committee voted to defeat an amendment offered by Rep. Dean Heller (R-NV) - by a vote of 21-18 - to require all members of Congress to get insurance through the government-run plan - proving Democrats do not think the government-plan will provide quality health care.  Republicans voted unanimously in favor of the amendment, believing if it is good enough for the American people, it should be good enough for members of Congress.
 
CLAIM: ""And the Recovery Act will continue to save and create more jobs over the next two years - just like it was designed to do.""
 
FACT: First, the Administration promised the stimulus will ""save or create"" 3.5 to 4 million jobs.  It also promised that it would start doing so IMMEDIATELY - a claim that remains on the White House website today.  We now know that more than two million jobs have been lost since the stimulus was enacted in February and unemployment has now risen to 9.5 percent, far above the eight percent the Administration promised if their trillion-dollar 'stimulus' was passed.

politics,"I want socialism in America, because so far it's great!","With socialism being defined as government controlled and heavily regulated, here is a list of things I'd like to be socialized in America:

- Cell phone service (but definitely not the hardware)

- internet service

- Schools, but I'd like all colleges to be completely free, with extremely high standards. if you can't maintain academic progress you are ""let go"" you can attempt later, but must maintain a C average. If you are dropped from the system, you'd have to pay for a technical or ""working"" school where you will be trained directly for your future line of work. These schools will put you in the job market faster and therefore you'll be able to pay back your loans quickly. I honestly don't believe college is for everyone- a smaller version of this more lopsided towards academics could be created for highs school students as well. 

- Medical care- I realize there's a huge debate on this, but I want to be able to walk into a hospital and not worry about the bill.

- Oil- it's a natural resource, part of the country, it should be harvested by government bodies and sold at cost. While some might think this might hurt the environment by driving up usage, the government would be the most inclined to stop all oil production and get clean energy rather than the buyers.

Lastly to do away with the power that comes with money, I'd like to make campaign contributions, and any lobbying completely illegal. Support an issue the way you are intended to, with you're own voice. 

This would be an awesome America. 

Edit: A lot of this discussion has gone into why I would ""punish"" students for going to vocational schools by making them pay for it. My model is loosely based on the Belgium model of higher education, but by making say 40% of all students pay for a vocational school that lasts two to three years it helps to reduce the cost for university students. They'll be in the job market much faster, able to work and pay off any loans (which would be available to all vocational student at an extremely low interest rate). I also would foresee that university training is six years rather than four, because you need specialization of your area, and obviously I'd leave medical programs well alone. 

Beyond the practical and shortsighted, my underlying reason is that by giving working students debt, money management is a necessity, in fact it will likely be incorporated into their general education. If you believe mostly the poor will enter the vocational schools, then you should know the poor have little experience with how to manage money. Giving them a small debt, with a debt counselor, forces responsibility rather than reckless spending of newfound wealth. I imagine minimum wage would drop, because the new working class would be higher compensated, promoting the system that if you want to step up and use your mind, and then skills, then you can command a better lifestyle. If not, you can remain in poverty, or as usual minimum wage jobs can line the pockets of free spending high schoolers.",energy,2009-08-16,-0.0641065651361115

So after all the publicity, I don't doubt that Mars tests on animals, not necessarily because of this web-page, but because of this:
If I pick up a bag of M&amp;Ms it does not say ""Not tested on animals,"" and if they didn't test on animals, they'd proclaim that.

What perplexes me is this, what are they testing?
According to the before mentioned website:
&gt; Mars recently funded a deadly experiment on rats to determine the &gt; effects of chocolate ingredients on their blood vessels. Experimenters &gt; force-fed the rats by shoving plastic tubes down their throats and  
&gt; then cut open the rats' legs to expose an artery, which was clamped &gt; shut to block blood flow. After the experiment, the animals were 
&gt; killed. Mars has also funded cruel experiments in which mice were 
&gt; fed a candy ingredient and forced to swim in a pool of a water mixed &gt; with white paint. The mice had to find a hidden platform to avoid 
&gt; drowning, only to be killed and dissected later on. In yet another 
&gt; experiment supported by Mars, rats were fed cocoa and anesthetized &gt; with carbon dioxide so that their blood could be collected by injecting &gt; a needle directly into their hearts, which can lead to internal 
&gt; bleeding and other deadly complications. 

So why do they want to see the effects of a candy product on mice trying to find a platform in opaque liquid?  Are they trying to find out if the candy has a mind altering effect?

Also, yes I think this is horrible.  By inquiring about a purpose to the testing I'm not saying that I - in any way - condone testing on animals.  I don't. So don't yell at me.",technology,2009-08-18,-0.2159218018104485

The Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill are engaged in a great struggle over the state of our health-care system. The Democrats have an answer that, while not perfect, appears by many accounts to be a vast improvement over our current condition. Yet the future of these proposals is anything but certain.

The President himself has stepped forward lately in an attempt to not only preserve what appeared to be a stalled bill, but to salvage a potentially deadlocked situation. He has up to this point been hesitant to take these actions.

But this health-care issue is part of a larger problem in this country. Some of the seemingly intractable problems that have plagued our country for decades, like health-care, our expanding empire abroad and its accompanying military-industrial complex or the War on Drugs, have largely been ignored by both parties in Washington. Debate is confined to a narrow spectrum and often consists of superficial differences. 

When there is debate, as there currently is with health-care, it seems to take place in another dimension from the concerns or problems suffered by everyday Americans. The fact that 70% of this country favors healthcare reform and there is a distinct possibility that it will not pass is alarming. 

More “radical” members of both parties are often exploited for votes in elections only to be marginalized after the first Tuesday in November.

So what can a citizen do? Until recently, cynicism prevailed. Even now it is fashionable, if understandable, to doubt that any real change could take place. The election of Barack Obama has helped to engage a new generation with politics. But his election can not be the end of this engagement. One man can not solve all of our problems, nor should that be expected. Citizenship implies responsibility.

We live in a world with technology that puts the power of communication with our fellow man in more hands than ever before. We are seeing the effects of this change more every day. 

The Internet has magnified what has always been true. Any group of people, dedicated to a cause, can alter the world they live in. Historically, broad social change has been difficult to achieve, requiring the coordinated efforts of numerous people, many of whom differ on a number of key points. It has taken struggle.

Here in America, it took a century of work to put forth civil rights legislation that overcame many of the bitter legacies of slavery. It was only in the last century that women gained the franchise. Today many of our citizens are engaged in a fight for marriage equality.

But we have seen recently that when the political goal is narrow, the Internet can facilitate unprecedented success. Ron Paul was able to run the most successful insurgent campaign since Ross Perot’s on the backs of a dedicated online base. Obama himself owes much of his success to a grassroots effort that was often coordinated online. Much of the debate on the legalization of marijuana has been driven forward by members of the online community.

There is an opportunity right now to not only solve many of our problems, which seem to be coming to a head, but to recreate our political system as it stands. We are at a possible turning point in history and there may not be a better or more effective time to leverage real change.

The solution to our problems does not lie in the creation of a new party to replace the Republicans or in more active engagement with either party. Indeed, the problem is that regardless of how forcefully one advocates for a position in either party, unless a majority of those members can be convinced of the merits of an idea, it is doomed to failure. Citizens are often condemned to voting for what they term the lesser evil. What is the alternative?

George Washington, in his farewell address, warned against political parties. Short of their demise, when candidates can be judged on the merits of their ideas and not the labels they carry, there is an alternative.

The alternative is not a third party. Rather, it is a third, a fourth, however many parties as the governmental marketplace will bear.

Skeptics might say that by aligning with an independent candidate or third party, citizens are dooming the candidate they would most closely identify with to defeat. To a degree they are right.

That is why the terms of debate and engagement in this country must change. 

I propose the beginning of an honest debate, to be carried forward in the most honest forum I know, the Internet. How can we create greater competition for our governmental currency, the ballot?

I have a proposal, though it may not be the best one available, nor should it be the end all and be all of this discussion. Rather, I think it is well-equipped to harness the unique strengths of the Internet, which can so effectively leverage a large group of people whom share a narrow vision. It is a fairly simple outline but potentially broad in its consequences. It also has the merit of allowing a broad number of people to take part, for its goals aren’t ideological, but the implementation and utilization of certain tools that can create a viable marketplace.

The first and most obvious answer is further involvement in government by anyone with the goal of undermining the two-party system. I would urge that you run as an Independent. Let your ideas be judged by their merits without labels tarnishing people’s perceptions of you. Many local offices are either non-partisan, rendering this point moot, or rarely contested. Indeed, it may be possible to run for office and gain it unopposed. 

This has the added benefit of increasing name recognition for anyone willing to take their political career farther than town hall or the county commission. Many politicians achieve a certain level of recognition in a community and easily achieve re-election against all but the most serious contenders. Our most popular politicians have recognized the value of familiarity. Abraham Lincoln exploited his tall, gangly frame by often wearing all-black and a top hat, rendering him a unique figure in any crowd.

One potentially useful tool would be the referendum. Many states have this already. We have seen how the meaningful action on many issues has taken place at the state level. Federalism is alive and well. A referendum may create laws or even amend the state constitution. If your state has the referendum, I would recommend that it be used to introduce a manner of voting I will soon detail. If it does not, then obviously one should lobby your representatives to allow referendums by law, or better yet, run for office and push for its implementation yourself. 

This is, in my opinion, the first and key step to eliminating a two-party system. To do so in a state legislature is nearly impossible, for it would require either a majority of predisposed Independents or third-party candidates, or the votes of current legislators against their obvious interests.

The method of voting I would recommend is Instant-Runoff voting. It is detailed as follows by Wikipedia:

Instant-runoff voting (IRV) is the American English term for a voting system used for single-winner elections, in which voters rank candidates in an order of preference. If no candidate is the first preference of a majority of voters, the candidate with the fewest number of first preference rankings is eliminated and that candidate's ballots are redistributed at full value to the remaining candidates according to the next ranking on each ballot. This process is repeated until one candidate obtains a majority of votes among candidates not eliminated. The term ""instant runoff"" is used because the method is said to simulate a series of runoff elections tallied in rounds, as in an exhaustive ballot election.

I believe this is a simple and effective method of eliminating the false dichotomy the two-party system represents while allowing room for a broad coalition of citizens and ideologies, many of whose motivations may greatly differ.

There is room here for anti-war progressives who feel dissatisfied with Obama’s policies in the Middle East, Libertarians who feel estranged from the Republican Party and evangelical Christians who are tired of seeing no results in their fight against abortion.

If awareness of this option grows and more states implement this method of voting, it could gain momentum and become an exponentially more powerful movement.

Everyone benefits from greater competition and more choices at the ballot box. This solution has a certain American appeal, for it allows citizens to take responsibility and be better positioned to solve the problems we face today.

P.S. I'm consistently amazed at the broad base of knowledge in the Reddit community and the dedication shown by its members to the causes it believes in. I genuinely believe this could be the location of an informed debate that eventually arrives at a much-needed conclusion to the question I ask in this essay. Disagree with me if you wish, I won't take it personally. I hope to see other ideas offered here.

politics,Mr. President:  I chose you over my grandparents when I voted for you.  You'd damn well better choose me over big pharma and health insurance companies!,"To make a long story short, when I voted for you, President Obama, my grandparents disowned me.  I was written out of their will, called an idiot for voting for 'that nigger,' called a pussy for being distraught over the chaos caused by two ongoing and pointless conflicts that I myself had fought in, and was called stupid for not realizing that John McCain and Sarah Palin could have run the country better than Obama and Biden.

These were kind grandparents that treated me well and even took me in as their own child for years when my mother was unable to take care of me.  Always considerate and jovial, I enjoyed going home and visiting them almost more than the rest of my family combined.  Now, because of the vile crap they have watched over the last decade on Fox News and other terrible lies that they've swallowed, I basically never get to see them again because I took a stand for you, Mr. President.  They are so full of rage and vitriol that I hardly imagine it will fade before they pass.  I never get to know my grandparents again because they could not believe that their grandson would vote for a progressive black man who promised change.

I voted for you because I believed you would achieve great change for this country.  I believed that you were the best choice and that you would serve us well.  Because that is your purpose, Mr. President.  To serve us, the people.  Not to serve big pharma or health care or CEOs or the giant pile of douchebags in the House and the Senate.  Us.  Average people with average lives - and many of us live on below-average wages that mean we go without real health care because it is impossible to give up 30% of your paycheck when you need 90% of it just to get by.

And now you want to back down before the lobbyists and the pundits who ask hard questions about a public option.  The answers to these questions are easy for an academic such as yourself, Mr. President.  I understand that you are somewhat tentative about answering them so candidly, because it would annoy even further a base of always-angry people that already find you lacking.

It is horrifying that health insurance can even be a for-profit business.  But this is America, and it can - so that's that.  However, the bottom line should never, ever, ever be allowed to be the reasoning for denial-of-care.  In fact, there is no acceptable reason for denying care to any citizen of the greatest nation on this Earth.  We deserve it, Mr. President.  And we deserve better than current health insurance companies are offering us.  A public health care option will open this country's eyes, and force the ridiculously evil tactics of our current health care 'providers' to be altered, forever.

To those who say it would cost too much: Get over it.  Where was your outrage over a trillion-dollar-a-year war, or a trillion-dollar bailout?  These costs will go directly towards the betterment of our citizens' lives, or save them!  Mr. President, I, for one, welcome such a cost.

To those who say private businesses cannot compete with the government, I say to you:  Bullshit.  FedEx, UPS, KBR, Blackwater, Halliburton, and a thousand other contracting companies thrive by outperforming and undercutting our government's sectors.  Yes, health insurance providers would have to change their ways to stay ahead of the game.  Yes, they would probably make less money than the hundreds of billions of dollars they pilfer from the American populace currently.  But they would still exist, and prosper.  But so would we, the people who need to be allowed to have care, even when we don't have the money to afford it.

TL;DR:  Mr. President, don't you dare remove the public option.  It will solve nothing to do so, and our country will be worse off without it.  Do not back down to pundits and lobbyists.  Fix the problem, Mr. President, don't make it worse.  Someday, your people will thank you for it.  All of us.",finance,2009-08-19,-0.2639722102293749

politics,Here's the letter I submitted to my congressman in support of a public option for health care,"I live in the 40th district in California (North Orange County) and my congressman is Ed Royce, a Republican.  I've met him (see below) and like the guy, even though I don't agree with his political views.  Here's the letter I sent him via the [write your representative system](http://www.house.gov/writerep/).  I will be following up with a hard copy and phone call as well, as they might carry more weight than an e-mail.  Regardless of where you stand, you might think about weighing in with your representative as well.

&gt; Ed,

&gt; First, I would like to send you a long belated ""Thank You"" for a visit my wife and I made to your Washington D.C. office in 2000.  I'm not sure if you remember, but it was on a day that a female legislator (whose name escapes me, I'm afraid) from the then recent Nigerian election was accompanying you in order to learn more about our democratic traditions.  I have a photo of us shaking hands that I still display in my office at work.  I recall that we discussed your recent efforts to restrict the sale of ""Blood Diamonds"" in the U.S. and that you were somewhat surprised that anyone from your district had made note of the bill.  We also discussed our common alma mater - CSUF.  It was a wonderful trip made even more enjoyable by you and your talented staff.

&gt; Honestly, I feel embarrassed to only write to you now when there is an issue that concerns me, but I feel I must make my voice heard on the current debate on health care.  Here is where I stand:

&gt; I want a ""public option"" for health care, preferably one with substantial funding for an ""inspector general"" style office to minimize waste, fraud, and abuse.  I have studied the issue carefully and, although I normally am loathe to support efforts to increase our Federal government, the benefits outweigh the costs.  It is fundamentally unfair that pharmaceutical and insurance companies can collude to deny coverage or increase costs but the American people are not allowed to band together as a market force to negotiate lower prices and better service.  The arguments against a public option do not convince me.  The notion that it would somehow be contrary to a healthy free market strikes me as fundamentally false and deceptive.  Frankly, the costs of such a system, particularly compared to the bailout of our financial system, is a bargain.

&gt; Just to be clear:  I like you, Ed.  However, this is a pivotal moment in our country and I feel I must stand up for what I believe is right.  If you vote against a Health Care bill that includes a public option, you have lost my vote.  I ask you to consider this when the time comes.

&gt; Thank you for your time,

business,UPS is NOT seeking a bailout. They are looking to reverse an 80 year-old unfair labor law that protects one (and only one) company by preventing its workers from unionizing.,"I work for UPS and have now for 3 years so take from this what you will…

The Railway Labor Act of 1926 was enacted to try and prevent strikes within airline and railroad companies. It was set up because of strikes that not only shut down major industries but also often ended in violence. It provides arbitration and mediation as an alternative to worker’s strikes. FedEx uses that act today to prevent its workers from unionizing. Because of the wording of the act and the way that FedEx uses it (FedEx is on the books as an airline company and not a shipping company), the only way their hourly workers could unionize is if every single one of them wanted to. If even one of their approximately 280,000 workers decided that they didn’t want to unionize the entire of their working body would not be allowed to do so. This is one of a handful of not-so-legitimate business practices that FedEx uses to keep their costs down. The worst of which is that they (according to their books) employ zero drivers. All those guys who drive FedEx trucks are “independent contractors” for whom FedEx pays zero taxes.
 
UPS does very little lobbying. They easily send more money to the united way than to any political entity. They are not asking for one cent from the government. They are simply asking congress to take a second look at this law. Brownbailout.com suggests that UPS is a huge political entity that that FedEx has zero pull with anyone but somehow this law is still on the books even though it protects only one company in the shipping industry.
	
There is a section on brownbailout.com about UPS “forcing” it’s employees to write letters to their congressmen. UPS asked each of it’s employees, including me, to write letters to their senators asking them to consider this bill. I told my supervisor that I would not write it. He asked for my reasons and I told him that I am not in favor of adding another 200k+ unionized workers to the American workforce and, more importantly, that I am very uncomfortable with my employer asking me to take action in a political forum. He stated his point and said that if I was not comfortable writing the letter, I did not have to. I know of at least 10 other people (in my work area of about 70 people) who refused to write the letters and none of us have suffered ANY sort of repercussion from it. UPS ASKED their employees to write letters. If any manager in the company demanded or coerced their employees into writing those letters, that manager should be fired immediately.

That’s my take on the issue. It’s not as flashy as brownbailout.com (since I know nothing of programming and don’t have FedEx’s financial backing on this) but it gets my point across. If someone from FedEx wants to rebut, I’d be glad to hear their side of the story.",finance,2009-08-19,-0.3895085900637298
Economics,"This is how we let the credit crunch happen, 
Ma'am...economists concisely explain to the Queen 
why no-one foresaw the Credit Crunch.","DEAR MADAM,
When Your Majesty visited the London School of Economics last November, you quite rightly asked: why had nobody noticed that the credit crunch was on its way? The British Academy convened a forum on 17 June 2009 to debate your question, with contributions from a  range of experts from business, the City, its regulators, academia, and government. This letter summarises the views of the participants and the factors that they cited in our discussion, and we hope that it offers an answer to your question.  



Many people did foresee the crisis. However, the exact form that it would take and the timing of its onset and ferocity were foreseen by nobody. What matters in such circumstances is not just to predict the nature of the problem but also its timing. And there is also finding the will to act and being sure that authorities have as part of their powers the right instruments to bring to bear on the problem.  



There were many warnings about imbalances in financial markets and in the global economy. For example, the Bank of International Settlements expressed repeated concerns that risks did not seem to be properly reflected in financial markets. Our own Bank of England issued many warnings about this in their bi-annual Financial Stability Reports. Risk management was considered an important part of financial markets. One of our major banks, now mainly in public ownership, reputedly had 4000 risk managers. But the difficulty was seeing the risk to the system as a whole rather than to any specific financial instrument or loan. Risk calculations were most often confined to slices of financial activity, using some of the best mathematical minds in our country and abroad. But they frequently lost sight of the bigger picture.  



Many were also concerned about imbalances in the global economy. We had enjoyed a period of unprecedented global expansion which had seen many people in poor countries, particularly China and India, improving their living standards. But this prosperity had led to what is now known as the ‘global savings glut’. This led to very low returns on safer long-term investments which, in turn, led many investors to seek higher returns at the expense of greater risk. Countries like the UK and the USA benefited from the rise of China which lowered the cost of many goods that we buy, and through ready access to capital in the financial system it was easy for UK households and businesses to borrow. This in turn fuelled the increase in house prices both here and in the USA. There were many who warned of the dangers of this.  


But against those who warned, most were convinced that banks knew what they were doing. They believed that the financial wizards had found new and clever ways of managing risks. Indeed, some claimed to have so dispersed them through an array of novel financial instruments that they had virtually removed them. It is difficult to recall a greater example of wishful thinking combined with hubris. There was a firm belief, too, that financial markets had changed. And politicians of all types were charmed by the market. These views were abetted by financial and economic models that were good at predicting the short-term and small risks, but few were equipped to say what would happen when things went wrong as they have. People trusted the banks whose boards and senior executives were packed with globally recruited talent and their non-executive directors included those with proven track records in public life. Nobody wanted to believe that their judgement could be faulty or that they were unable competently to scrutinise the risks in the organisations that they managed. A generation of bankers and financiers deceived themselves and those who thought that they were the pace-making engineers of advanced economies.   



All this exposed the difficulties of slowing the progression of such developments in the presence of a general ‘feel-good’ factor. Households benefited from low unemployment, cheap consumer goods and ready credit. Businesses benefited from lower borrowing costs. Bankers were earning bumper bonuses and expanding their business around the world. The government benefited from high tax revenues enabling them to increase public spending on schools and hospitals. This was bound to create a psychology of denial. It was a cycle fuelled, in significant measure, not by virtue but by delusion.  


Among the authorities charged with managing these risks, there were difficulties too. Some say that their job should have been ‘to take away the punch bowl when the party was in full swing’. But that assumes that they had the instruments needed to do this. General pressure was for more lax regulation – a light touch. The City of London (and the Financial Services Authority) was praised as a paragon of global financial regulation for this reason.  


There was a broad consensus that it was better to deal with the aftermath of bubbles in stock markets and housing markets than to try to head them off in advance. Credence was given to this view by the experience, especially in the USA, after the turn of the millennium when a recession was more or less avoided after the ‘dot com’ bubble burst. This fuelled the view that we could bail out the economy after the event. 


Inflation remained low and created no warning sign of an economy that was overheating. The Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee had helped to deliver an unprecedented period of low and stable inflation in line with its mandate. But this meant that interest rates were low by historical standards. And some said that policy was therefore not sufficiently geared towards heading off the risks. Some countries did raise interest rates to ‘lean against the wind’. But on the whole, the prevailing view was that monetary policy was best used to prevent inflation and not to control wider imbalances in the economy.  



So where was the problem? Everyone seemed to be doing their own job properly on its own merit. And according to standard measures of success, they were often doing it well. The failure was to see how collectively this added up to a series of interconnected imbalances over which no single authority had jurisdiction. This, combined with the psychology of herding and the mantra of financial and policy gurus, lead to a dangerous recipe. Individual risks may rightly have been viewed as small, but the risk to the system as a whole was vast.  
 


So in summary, Your Majesty, the failure to foresee the timing, extent and severity of the crisis and to head it off, while it had many causes, was principally a failure of the collectiveimagination of many bright people, both in this country and internationally, to understand the risks to the system as a whole.  



Given the forecasting failure at the heart of your enquiry, the British Academy is giving some thought to how your Crown servants in the Treasury, the Cabinet Office and the Department for Business, Innovation &amp; Skills, as well as the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority might develop a new, shared horizon-scanning capability so that you never need to ask your question again. The Academy will be hosting another seminar to examine the ‘never again’ question more widely. We will report the findings to Your Majesty. The events of the past year have delivered a salutary shock. Whether it will turn out to have been a beneficial one will depend on the candour with which we dissect the lessons and apply them in future.

Economics,A Bubble In Fear?,"Everywhere I look, markets are experiencing a ""flight to safety;"" people are saving money and paying down debt despite low interest rates, and looking to various levels of government to pat them on the head and assure them that everything will be alright. This looks to me like a primary market trend.

The thing is, recent primary market trends often seem to produce bubbles (such as the Internet, stocks, real-estate, and non-dollar investments, to give examples from the last ten years). If the primary trend is fear, are we possibly experiencing a bubble in fear? How would we know?

politics,The illusion of wealth and security &amp; 'pain compliance' as a social conditioning tool. How a population got enslaved by its masters.,"is the people's tenuous feeble link to health care, no coincidence that in the US with its seriously overpriced and rationed health care, that people are scared to death to upset the boss and lose their job/HI.

What better way to keep a workforce tame and cowered, no job no HI, no dentistry, no fixing of that problem, no relief from pain.

If you step back one moment and consider the issue of pain relief as a social conditioning tool, the only legal method to relive pain to through the RX system, all the non prescription over the counter methods are weak and very temporary. The private enterprise methods such as unlicensed heroin and cannabis are highly illegal and have been PRed into being seen as evil and immoral, so self medicating outside the official channel is a big crime.

A lot of people use booze as a cheap legal method of dulling lifes pains, yes it can help, but a daily reliance of alcohol turns people in slaves of one kind or another, and its a downward spiral into health problems. Ditto with over prescribed over used legal meds like tranquilizers.

The US law, court and prison system is generally a pain infliction system, if you upset the wrong person, they have the opportunity to ruin a person/families live for good, house car job and finances will be wrecked, and your resources looted for the system. The people who are mostly law abiding have a morbid and justifiable fear of prison, which is generally a system of semi official brutality, a persons physical and mental health can be ruined by a prison stay. This fear keeps the masses inline and cowed. The tax system is enforced through the law of the gun, the end result of tax refusing will result in violence from the state. No matter what they say, eventually nice men from the gov will arrive with guns and remove property and people.

One of the common memes/jokes in the US (pretty unused in Europe) is the thing about being sent to 'pound you in the *rse' federal/state prison, in a supposedly modern civilized society, this jokey fear is pretty outrageous when prisons allow the brutal topdog inmates to run the prison blocks through brutality, yes it makes the prison warders job easier, but definitely a cruel and unusual system of punishment.
Hollywood and TV reinforce this social conditioning fear and keep the public scared and compliant.

Infliction of pain and the fear of pain is a basic animistic prime mover, from the smallest mammal to the human kind, pain motivates and is a tool of the thugs.",cryptocurrency,2009-08-22,-0.3244582114620107

politics,My Mom just FWDed this to me,"The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.

The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving.

CBS, NBC , PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast.

How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper, and everybody cries when they sing, 'It's Not Easy Being Green.'

Jesse Jackson stages a demonstration in front of the ant 's house where the news stations film the group singing, 'We shall overcome.' Jesse then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.

Nancy Pelosi &amp;John Kerry exclaim in an interview with Larry King that the ant has gotten rich off the back ofthe grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share.

Finally, the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity &amp;Anti-Grasshopper Act retroactive to the beginning of the summer.

The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the government.

The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ant’s food while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.

The ant has disappeared in the snow.

The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.",finance,2009-08-24,-0.4799257677055358

politics,A Physicians take on the National Healthcare Debate,"This letter is from Dr. Zane Pollard.  He is operates at Children's Health
Care of Atlanta .   Google him, he has a very impressive CV.

 Friends:
  I have  been sitting quietly on the sidelines watching all of this national debate on healthcare. It is time for me  to  bring some clarity to the table and as your  friend by explaining many of the  problems from the aspect of a doctor.

 First off the  government has  involved  very few  of  us physicians in the  healthcare debate.While the American Medical Association has come out in favor of the plan, it is vital to remember that the AMA only represents  17% of the  American physician workforce.

 I have taken care of Medicaid patients for 35 years while representing the only pediatric ophthalmology group left in Atlanta , Georgia that accepts Medicaid.Why is this. For example, in the past  6 months I have  cared  for three  young children on Medicaid who had corneal ulcers. This is  a potentially blinding  situation because if the cornea perforates from the infection, almost  surely blindness will occur. In all three cases the antibiotic needed  for the eradication of the infection was not on the approved Medicaid list. Each time I was  told to fax  Medicaid for the approval forms which I did. Within 48 hours  the form came back to me which was mailed in immediately via fax and I was told that  I would have my answer in 10 days. Of course  by then  each child would have  been blind in
the eye. Each time the  request came back denied. All three times  I
personally  provided the  antibiotic for  each patient which was not on the Medicaid approved  list. Get the point-rationing of care.

  Over the past  35  years I have  cared  for over 1000 children  born with congenital cataracts. In older children and   20  in adults the  vision is rehabilitated with an intraocular  lens. In newborns we use contact lenses which are very expensive. It  takes Medicaid over  one year to approve a contact lens post  cataract surgery. By that time a successful anatomical operation is wasted as the child will be close to blind from a lack of focusing for so long a period of time. Again  extreme rationing. Solution- I have a foundation here in Atlanta supported  100% by private funds which supplies all of these  contact lenses for  my Medicaid and illegal immigrants children for free. Again waiting for the government would be disastrous.

  Last  week I  had a lady  bring her child to me.They are Americans but live in Sweden as the  father has a job with a big corporation. The child had the on set of  double vision 3 months ago and has been unable to function normally because of this. They are  people of means but are waiting 8 months to see the ophthalmologist in Sweden . Then if the child needed surgery they would be  put on a 6 month waiting list. She called me and I saw her that day. It turned out  that  the child had  accommodative esotropia (crossing of the eyes treated with glasses that  correct for farsightedness) and  responded to glasses within  4 days, no surgery was needed. Again rationing of care.

  Last  month I operated  on a  70 year old  lady with double vision present for 3 years. She  responded quite nicely to her surgery and now is symptom free. I also operated on a 69 year  old  judge  with vertical double vision. His surgery went very well and now he is happy as a lark.  I have  been told- but of course  there is no healthcare  bill that has been passed yet that  these  2 people because of their age  would have  been denied  surgery and just told to wear a patch over one eye to alleviate the symptoms of double vision. Obviously cheaper than surgery.

  I spent  two year  in the  US  Navy  during the Viet Nam war and was well treated by the military.There was  tremendous  rationing of care and we were told specificially what things  the  military  personnel and their dependents could have  and which things they could not have. While in Viet Nam, my wife Nancy  got sick  and got essentially no care at the Naval Hospital in Oakland , California . She went home and went to her family's private internist in Beverly Hills . While it was  expensive, she received an immediate work up. Again rationing of care.

  For those of you who are  over 65, this  bill in its present form might be lethal for you. People in England over 59 cannot  receive  stents for their coronary arteries. The government wants  to mimic  the British  plan. For those of you  younger,   it will still mean restriction of the care that you and your children receive.

  While 99% of  physicians went into  medicine  because of the love  of medicine and the  challenge of helping  our fellow man, economics are still important. My rent goes up 2% each year and  the salaries of my employees goes up 2% each year. Twenty  years  ago ophthalmologists were paid $1800 for a cataract  surgery and today  $500. This is  a 73%  decrease in our fees. I do not know of many  jobs in America that have  seen this lowering of fees.   But there is more  to the story that  just the lower fees. When I came to Atlanta there was a well known ophthalmologist that charged $2500 for a cataract surgery as he felt the was the best. He  had a terrific  reputation and in fact  I had my mother's  bilateral cataracts  operated on by him with a wonderful  result. She is now  94 and has 20/20 vision in  both eyes. People  would pay his  $2500 fee. However  then the government came in and said that any doctor that  does  medicare  work can not  accept  more than the going rate  ( now  $500)  or  he or she would be  severely fined. This put an end to his  charging  $2500.  The government said it  was illegal to accept more than the government  allowed  rate. What  I am driving at is that those of you well off  will not  be able to go to the head of the line under this new  healthcare  plan just because you have money as no physician will be willing to go against the law to treat  you.

  I am a pediatric ophthalmologist and  trained  for  10 years  post college to become a pediatric ophthalmologist ( add  two years  of my service in the Navy and that comes  to 12 years).A neurosurgeon spends 14 years  post  college and if  he or she has to do the military that would be 16 years. I am not entitled to make what a neurosurgeon makes but  the new plan calls for all physicians to make the same amount of payment. I assure you that  medical students will not go into neurosurgery and we will have a tremendous shortage of neurosurgeons. Already the top neurosurgeon at my hospital who is in good health and only 52 years  old has just quit because he can't stand working with the government anymore. Forty-nine  percent  of children under the age  of 16 in the state of Georgia are on medicaid so he felt he just could not stand working  with the beaurocracy anymore.

We are being lied to about the uninsured.They are  getting care. I operate  at least  2  illegal immigrants each month who pay me nothing and the children's hospital at which I operate charges them nothing also. This is true not only on Atlanta , but of every community in America.

  The bottom line is that I urge all of you to  contact your congresswomen and congressmen and senators to defeat this bill. I promise you that you will not like rationing of your own health.

   Furthermore, how can you trust  a physician that works under these conditions knowing that he is controlled by the state. I certainly could not trust any doctor that  would work under these  draconian conditions.

  One last thing, with this new healthcare plan there will be a tremendous shortage of physicians. It  has been estimated that approximately  5% of the current physician work force  will quit under this new  system. Also it is estimated that  another 5% shortage will occur because of decreased men and women wanting to go into  medicine. At the present time the US government has  mandated gender equity in admissions to medical schools.  That means that  for the past  15 years that somewhere between 49 and 51% of  each entering class  are females. This is true of private schools also  because all private schools receive  federal fundings.  The average  career of a woman in medicne now is only 8-10 years and the
average  work week for a female in medicine is only 3-4 days. I have now trained 35  fellows in pediatric ophthalmology. Hands down the  best was  a female that I trained  4 yea rs  ago- she  was head and  heels above all others I have trained.  She now  practices  only 3 days a week.

gaming,GameFly will spam your email!,"I just wanted to put this out there, especially since I've seen GameFly posting up ads on Reddit lately. It's already been documented that GameFly has teamed up with WLI Reservation Rewards to scam customers (see http://www.google.com/search?q=gamefly+wli+reservation+rewards ), however I have reason to believe they are now providing customer email addresses to spammers as well! Caveat emptor!

I was a GameFly subscriber for several years, however I cancelled my account after coming to the realization that I only play 5 or so console games a year, and the subscription cost wasn't worth it any more.

Like I do for most websites I register for, I created an email address specific to GameFly as a method of protecting against spam (eg, gamefly@[mydomain.com]. This email address was used for nothing besides registering for the site and receiving member/subscription updates. Of course I was a little surprised to see spam start to trickle in this last week. It's a trivial matter for me to kill the email address and stop receiving spam, however you might like to be aware that this is happening regardless!

A special message from American Political Action Committee:

Stop Obama’s Energy Tax For Heath Care 

80% of the ENERGY TAX INCREASE is slated for the General Federal Budget.  Just 20% of the Increased Energy Tax Revenue is directed at Obama’s green economy and jobs. 
 
The Obama Health Care Tax scam will cost billions and a new revenue source is needed according to Obama Treasury Sec. Geithner who didn't rule out new taxes as a means to do so. Timothy Geithner said when asked if new taxes were likely ""what the country needs to do is understand we're going to have to do what it takes, we're going to do what's necessary.”
 
The Obama administration tax increase plan strategy includes an Energy Report it issued that contains no new research intentionally scaring the public with the grimmest, most urgent language on climate change ever to come out of any White House.   False computer simulations about rising sea levels, sweltering temperatures, deeper droughts, and heavier downpours — blaming carbon for global warming's alleged serious effects and lying to the country to collect the Obama “Energy Tax”.   The House rushed a bill through before going on vacation and the Senate expects to do the same.
 
But was the report complete?  Did it have all the relevant data?  NO!!!
 
Get Ready Now with the Senate Million Fax Campaign –
The Obama-Pelosi-Reid Bill Strategy (Obama PR-BS) is dumping unfinished bills without notice or time to read the details on the House and Senate floor for votes.  We must STOP Obama PR-BS and get ready for the Senate Fight.  To do this we want to have 1 Million Faxes ready to go and everyone ready to call their Senators.
 
OBAMA’S reckless promise to get elected now appears to be just another Obama lie when he said “I pledge. No family making less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase.” Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, NOT ANY OF YOUR TAXES.”

Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla has ordered an investigation into the Environmental Protection Agency's alleged suppression of a 98-page report, co-authored by EPA analyst Alan Carlin that questioned the science behind global warming. 

The report details how regulating gases like carbon dioxide WILL NOT reduce global warming. Carlin's report states that the information the EPA is using is out of date, and that even as atmospheric carbon dioxide levels have increased, global temperatures have declined. 

Inhofe said ""He (Carlin) came out with the truth. They don't want the truth at the EPA,"" he's ordered an investigation. ""We're going to expose it."" 

Carbon Dioxide DOES NOT Cause Global Warming 

The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPPC) Data
The Truth For seven and a half years, is that global temperatures have been falling rapidly. The UN IPCC's predicted warming path (pink region) bears no relation to the global cooling data that the IPCC has observed in the 21st century to date. Source: SPPI global temperature index.

Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Is Food For Plants not ""Air Pollutant"" 

CO2 is not an ""air pollutant,"" but rather food for plants and marine life. And its atmospheric levels are controlled by temperature and other biological/chemical variables -- not the other way around (Just as: Lung Cancer does not cause smoking). But most of all, a magical CO2 knob for controlling weather and climate simply does not exist. 

The possible effect that forcing down CO2 levels may have on plants by reducing the food supply are catastrophic. 

WHY BLAME CARBON DIOXIDE? 

The Answer:
Democrats Are Using The Carbon Lie To Raise Taxes 

WITHOUT CARBON DIOXIDE TO BLAME THE OBAMA'S TAX INCREASE OF HISTORIC PROPORTIONS EVERYONE MUST PAY WHEN THEY FLIP ON A LIGHT SWITCH IS NOT NECESSARY 

Turning on the Light = Cap and Trade = Democrat Tax Increase 

Pelosi and the Democrats ignored American voters and listened to Obama and Gore as they lobbied for and passed the biggest tax increase in history that is estimated to increase energy costs per family by $1,600 to $3,200 each year. 

Obama promised over and over that he would cut taxes for the 95% of Americans making less than $250,000 per year during the campaign last year, in the debates, in speeches and now he lobbied for and got step one of his historic regressive tax increase on 100% of America, even those not paying income tax. 

Obama Campaigned On False Pretenses And Must Be Stopped. 

He pledged that his tax increases would only apply to the top 5% of Americans making over $250,000. Yet Obama fully supported passage of the House ""Energy TAX"" bill that taxes everyone that just flips on a light switch.

OBAMA ALREADY LOBBYING THE SENATE
President Obama called on senators to disregard what he called the ""misinformation"" offered by critics of his energy bill, which passed the House of Representatives late Friday night despite GOP predictions that it will further damage the economy. 

""We must not be prisoners of the past,"" he said in his radio and Internet address. ""Don't believe the misinformation out there that suggests there is somehow a contradiction between investing in clean energy and economic growth. It's just not true."" 

Democrats pushing the bill have admitted that the total tax costs per family will increase. But the whole purpose of the bill is to raise the price of using carbon-based energy to reduce its use, 17% by 2020 and 83% by 2050. That is probably going to require even more than $3,000 per family per year. 

Obama's Carbon Disaster 

Obama fanatically believes in a carbon disaster and The Great Energy Lie - that Energy Emissions Cause Global Warming. Obama ignores sound science and the United Nations own data that the earth has been in a 10 year cooling period said of the bill's passage ""There is no longer a debate about whether carbon pollution is placing our planet in jeopardy. It's happening."" 

The bill will also result in millions of lost jobs and a weakened economy due to high cost energy. Remaining manufacturing in America will flee overseas. The coal industry will be phased out. 

China Rejects ""Energy Tax"" bill will not reduce global warming 

Obama is on his own as countries around the world such as France, Poland, Australia, the Czech Republic, and New Zealand are turning against the cap-and-trade ""Energy Tax"" regressive policies for their own countries, and China that Obama is borrowing 50 cents of every dollar he spend from and India have rejected the idea for their emerging economies all along. 

Even global warming advocates admit that the bill passed by the House will have no significant effect in reducing global warming, despite all of its costs for the America people. 

With these and other developments on the horizon Obama is poised to break the central promise of his campaign, which took him straight to the White House. Did Obama win last year on false pretenses? Perhaps he might remember this cautionary tale: When the first President Bush broke his campaign pledge not to raise taxes in 1990, he was booted out in the next election. 

WE ARE GETTING READY TO FAX to EACH AND EVERY Senator as soon as Reid calls for a cloture vote. And will fax continuously to be heard. Be sure to send this Alert to EVERYONE you know who wants to help FORCE our government to STOP the EXCUSES and Save Taxpayers Not Spend More and Raise Taxes!

Former FEMA Director Michael Brown Joins Cold Creek Solutions, Offers Consulting Practice for Disaster Recovery

CENTENNIAL, CO - While leading federal relief efforts for 160 presidential declared disasters in his roles at FEMA and Homeland Security, Michael Brown heard one cringe-worthy phrase repeated again and again.

""People always say, 'I never thought it would happen to me,'"" said Brown. ""I would maintain that anyone who has a business, or a family, needs to recognize that disasters happen and disrupt life. Businesses especially need to plan for the worst.""

To spread this message, and to empower businesses in developing comprehensive proactive plans, Brown is joining with Cold Creek Solutions as the Vice-President of Disaster Recovery Practice. To offer insight into company preparation for disaster, and to highlight Cold Creek's unique solutions, Brown will also be leading seminars on business continuity and disaster recovery through the end of the year in select locations.

""Michael Brown intimately understands planning and how plans need to be adaptable and changeable,"" said Paul Schwappach, principal of Cold Creek Solutions, a technology planning firm focusing on data management. ""With Michael's experience and his unique view into what possibly could go wrong when looking at a plan, we can truly help clients be prepared for the unexpected.""

Brown, the former undersecretary of Homeland Security, was one of the longest-serving directors of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. He led federal relief efforts for disasters including the 9/11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in 2001, the Columbia Space Shuttle Disaster and California wildfire season in 2003, and the unprecedented 2004-2005 hurricane seasons. Brown also directed the nation's response to numerous foreign disasters and terrorist attacks.

Brown and Cold Creek will work to provide clients disaster recovery and business continuity solutions rooted in a perspective that can't be found elsewhere. To hear this perspective firsthand, clients and the general public are invited to attend a series of seminars, entitled ""Dispel the Myth ... It Won't Happen to Me! 
IT Business Alignment When Disaster Strikes."" 
Brown will share stories, discuss the very real impact of disaster, and examine the preparations companies can take to prevent catastrophe.

""These seminars talk directly to the disconnect between IT objectives and business objectives when it comes to business continuity,"" said Bob Spina, chief technology officer at Cold Creek. ""IT often doesn't get the requirements the rest of the business has, and vice versa. Michael will say these different aspects of the business both have significant value, and must be closely aligned in order to safeguard the data.""

""I've seen thousands of disasters, some where things work according to plan, and some where absolutely nothing works,' said Brown. ""What better person can a company talk to about those two extremes? Through these seminars and through my work with Cold Creek, I hope to impart a fresh perspective for businesses and their continuity plans.""

programming,"Hey proggit, I massively increased my VS2005 performance today at work, here's how I did it.","I was finally fed up with Visual Studio hanging for 5 seconds every time I saved a file, so I started googling and found [this article](http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/ViewFeedback.aspx?FeedbackID=347228).

The gist of it is this: VS creates a new subdirectory in Documents and Settings/yourusername/Local Settings/Application Data/Microsoft/WebsiteCache *every single time* you open a new project. If you have lots of projects in your solutions, like I do where I work, this adds up. I didn't want to wait around while NTFS calculated how many folders I had in that directory, but one of my coworkers had over 48000. Use the command line to delete them (Explorer will be waaaaay too slow), with:

rmdir /s /q ""c:\Documents and Settings\yourusername\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\WebsiteCache""

For bonus points, put this in a batch file and add it as a Scheduled Task. After I deleted all these empty folders, I saw a 5-10x speedup of searching in VS, as well as faster load times, saves, etc. Hope this is useful to some of you :-)",technology,2009-08-28,-0.0106945778119007

technology,'Government Liaison Officers' why ISPs have this position in their employee lineup.,"[S.773](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13578_3-10320096-38.html)

These types came into existance in ISPs under Bushco, I was stunned and bemused when my local cable company featured a grinning one as their employee of the month on late night cable a few years ago, shocking and Kafkaesque in its little slip of honesty.

S.773 will mean that IT people like the 'Government Liaison Officers' in local cable TV/ISPs will all be Federally certificated at a cost, and have the power and the mandate to switch off users at gov will, key packet switching parts of the Internet will also come under control of Washington bureaucrats and censors. Assuming it will become a federal crime to hold a job in certain sectors unless that person holds a relevant certificate, we enter the age of Kafka/Soviet style 'approved' internet by default.

Of course its all being done to stop the horrible hate speechers, teabaggers, CTers, UFOers, Bigfoot fans and nasty people out there in cyberspace, and also to protect the children, never forget the poor innocent children who need protecting. Until one day we are all the poor innocent mushroom children. If Bushco had had the power and the balls to censor the Internet rather than just illegally monitor dissenters, the last eight years would have been much worse, and prob Gramps and Plank or Darth and Jeb would be in the WH now.

Paranoid leftover GOP stooge Reichfuhrer Gates is still in and running the DoD, why this Republcian remnant is still there is a worrying and intriguing mystery. The DoD would love to extend their already wide grasp over the Internet and its denizens, They have 10s of thousands of DoD players in intel, many of whom prob dabble in Web matters.

So my question is, what would happen to our economy if hundreds of billions of dollars worth of  ""treasure"" was discovered.  I'm not really sure, would all the valuable goods just be snatched up piece by piece by private collectors and museums?  Would the value of each piece drop because it was all found at once?  what I mean is, if each piece was found individually, they would be worth one amount, but when found all together, there is no question of scarcity so would they be valued differently?  Would it affect our money?

Also, what if we all of a sudden struck gold?  our money is no longer tied to gold in a real way, so what would happen if the US gov't just happened to stumble upon vast gold reserves?

I'm not really familiar with how this stuff really works (as its been explained to me, the fed basically decides how much the dollar is worth, there is no real value to it any more - a dollar is only worth a dollar to me because I believe it is)  so I'm just curious what insights are necessary to follow this line of thinking.

politics,"My brother-in-law, a die hard Republican, sent me this. How do I respond?","Morning Bell: President Obama’s Failed Stimulus

""Posted By Conn Carroll On September 4, 2009 @ 9:35 am In Enterprise and Free Markets | 22 Comments

When President Barack Obama sold his $787 billion stimulus package to the American people, he set one metric for success: jobs [1]. Specifically, President Obama promised the American people he would create 4.1 million jobs by the end of 2010. [2] According to the President’s plan [3], the stimulus should have lowered the nation’s unemployment rate below 8% by this August. That is the objective standard the President set for himself.

And according to objective data [4] released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this morning, President Obama’s policies, and his stimulus package, have been complete failures. BLS reports [4] that the number of unemployed persons increased by 466,000 in August raising the nation’s unemployment to 9.7% … the highest it has been in 26 years.

Faced with the failure of their signature economic policy, the Obama administration trotted out Vice President Joe Biden to defend the stimulus yesterday in a speech [5] to the Brookings Institute. Biden claimed [5] that the stimulus bill created or saved between 500,000 and 750,000 jobs. This is demonstrably false. Job creation has fallen since the stimulus became law. When Congress passed the stimulus in February the new hire rate had fallen to 3.2% [6]. The most recent data, from June 2009, shows that after the stimulus passed, job creation fell even further to 2.9% [6]. Employers are creating fewer jobs than they did before the stimulus was passed.
Other data also shows that job creation has fallen sharply. Gallup surveys show [7] that far fewer Americans report that their companies are hiring than a year ago. Last August 37% of Americans reported their companies were hiring. That figure has now fallen to 24%. Lower job creation accounts for roughly two-thirds of the increase in unemployment since the recession began. [8]

Why has private-sector job creation fallen so sharply? The obvious and broad answer is the recession. A more precise answer is that business owners have grown wary about the future of the economy and consequently business investment has fallen sharply since the recession began. As businesses cut investments in new projects they have less need to hire, and job creation falls. As long as business investment remains low and entrepreneurs hold back from starting new enterprises, job creation will remain low–and unemployment, high.

Yesterday Vice President Biden said the stimulus “doesn’t reflect a lack of design; that was the design.” This is exactly why the stimulus has failed to reduce unemployment. Congress spending tens of billions of dollars on highway projects does nothing to encourage any business owners who do not build highways that potential investments will succeed. Spending tens of billions more to bail out state governments does not encourage an entrepreneur to take the risk of starting a small business. Government spending programs do not encourage the risk taking and innovation and investment needed to spur lasting job creation.

Who creates jobs? Employers with profitable businesses, investing and creating wealth. The stimulus bill was a grab bag of traditional liberal priorities that did nothing to encourage private sector employers to invest or create jobs. If anything the stimulus discourages investment and job creation. The enormous increase in federal spending that President Obama has undertaken raise the prospects of vastly higher taxes or rapidly rising inflation.

The federal deficit is expected to approach $2 trillion this year, and to remain well above $1 trillion for many years to come, doubling the national debt in just five years. This situation is not sustainable, but businesses can only guess how the federal government will restore order to its fiscal house, knowing full well that successful businesses make an attractive tax target. In the face of such a threatening environment, it is not surprising that job creation has fallen since President Obama signed the stimulus.""",finance,2009-09-05,-0.6586195299786952

Both book’s are vitally needed ammunition in defense of free market’s and sound money. The intellectual arguments advanced by proponents of Austrian School economics clearly, and precisely expose the monumental level of intellectual and moral bankruptcy that our current central banking and fiat monetary system is built upon and from which is operates! While it's true that many people properly sense that the politically powerful have rigged the deck in their favor and against the average citizen, it is also true that for the most part most people do not recognize the process by which the political elite obfuscates their masive plundering of the citizenry.  It's not until people like Ron Paul introduced Austrian School economic theory into the national political dialog has there been any real explanation offered to the average citizen to understand the sinister role the Federal Reserve's fiat monetary system plays, not in bettering our national interests, but in the preservation of the power of the political oligarchy which controls the leadership of both our ruling political parties that run our government.

politics,I hope we can get single payer health care! If there's two things I spend a lot of money on it's health care and child prostitutes. If you taxpayers pick up the medical bill - I'll have a lot more money to spend on the kids! I will spend your money wisely [wink - wink]!,"I have a problem with any bill which takes from one wallet and places in another.

Simply put, when taxpayers have to pay the bills of other people this is what happens. If I take $20 out of my paycheck that would have went towards buying a new pair of pants for my kid and give it to someone else (funneled through government), to pay a bill for goods and services they receive - that is $20 less I will have in my hand, and $20 more they will have in theirs. I earned them that money.

Now that I've helped him pay for whatever it was (medical expenses), he has $20 more [that I earned] to spend on whatever he wants.

My kid will have one less pair of decent pants, and the guy who got my money can go add it to his pool to spend it on whatever he wants, it'll probably be gas for his guzzler, pay-per-view, McDonalds, donate it to a politician I hate [since that's most of them], etc.

The point being that nobody has the right to take the responsibility away from a person to decide how best to spend their earnings and give them to another to do as he sees fit. At least not from a free person.

I can't stand finding out a representative who is paid with my tax money does some sick and immoral thing, and now we're being pushed to give everyone a paycheck equal to the amount of medical care they run up.

For those who have no income at all, and could not afford to spend 1 dime on medical costs this isn't the issue, for those who would normally pay their bills we will be giving them extra spending money.

Many will be decent people, but you can be sure that your money will help make possible for people to buy many more immoral and/or frivolous things, while you may go without some needed things.

Morality aside, our government doesn't have the power granted to impose this.

Many people will say that the federal government can do whatever it wants because of the 'general welfare' phrase in article 1 sec 8 of the Constitution. Then [after the fact] cry about the outcome of someone exercising their vision of 'general welfare'.

This is exactly why we have a constitution and limit on federal government, and why general welfare does not enable the federal government to do things not listed under the enumerated powers, which is perfectly obvious when you read the 10th amendment that says all powers not enumerated belong to the states and the people.

'General Welfare' is great as long as you get to decide what 'general welfare' is, it's nearly an excuse to impose tyranny and throw away the constitution.

So those who think this way - keep it up. It's mindsets like that which made the Bush years possible. If we followed our constitution to the letter it wouldn't matter if Hitler himself were president of the USA, he wouldn't be able to do whatever he wanted for 'general welfare'.

People don't seem to realize the grave they dig themselves by asking the grim reaper to cover them. By enabling our federal government with this type of power we may get 1 thing we think we want, but it will set precedence for an infinite number of things we don't.",cryptocurrency,2009-09-08,-0.0740293430648197

politics,"I am tired of people arguing about ""the public option"" while having no idea what it actually is.","I've lost track of how many threads I've seen talking about how terrible (or how awesome) the public option is based on glaring misconceptions. There are a lot of reasons for these misconceptions, not the least of which has been a months-long heavily-financed disinformation campaign and a Democratic Party with extremely poor communication skills.

For the record, I'm *strongly* in favor of a public option, which makes me all the more depressed when I see people supporting my position without knowing what they're talking about (to say nothing of opponents, who are even more uninformed).

But it's got to stop. If I see another thread of people calling each other fascists and commies over a proposal which neither of them understands, I'm going to lose it. Pro or con, we all have to have some basic grasp of the facts of the situation if we're going to have a sane discourse.

[Let's start with the actual text of the House bill {PDF warning}](http://edlabor.house.gov/documents/111/pdf/publications/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf). Yeah, that's a big document, but it's good to have on hand just so you have some concrete reference material. This is the bill which which will probably be voted on in the House of Representatives. It is not the bill which Max Baucus will be unveiling over the next week, or the bill which has passed the Senate HELP committee. However, these bills are at least 80% similar and will eventually be merged together in the final product. We can't yet know the specifics of how these bills will be merged, but we have a pretty good idea of the basics. For now, I'm going to specifically discuss the public option as proposed in the House bill.

The legislation concerning ""The Public Option"" is found in Subtitle B, beginning on page 116. Right off the bat, the first thing we see is that the Public Option will be ""Exclusive to the Exchange"" (221.b.1). The Exchange, a health insurance marketplace created by other parts of the bill, will be created so that individuals and small businesses can shop around for insurance with the same bargaining power of big businesses. This means that the public option, if it exists, will only be available to those in the exchange, and will have to compete with many private insurance companies.

Scrolling down to 221.b.3, we see that there will actually be more than one public option - it will offer ""basic, enhanced, and premium plans, and may offer premium-plus plans"". Each of these plans will cover different things, but will draw from a common fund and have combined bargaining power to achieve lower rates.

There's a few pages of boilerplate before we get to the next interesting bit starting on page 118. Section 222 describes how the public option will be financed. First, we see that the same rules which apply to private insurers apply to the public option as well (222.a.1). Then the kicker (221.a.1.B) - **the premiums collected must be ""at a level sufficient to fully finance the costs of (i) health benefits provided by the public health insurance option; and (ii) administrative costs""**. In other words, and I cannot emphasize this enough, ** *THE PUBLIC OPTION IS NOT SUBSIDIZED, IT IS REQUIRED TO BE SELF-FINANCING, AND DOES NOT COST THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ANY MONEY* **. As far as I can tell, almost nobody understands this. I see ""serious"" talking heads on tv talking about how we can't afford the public option. That's like saying we can't afford the post office - neither of them costs any money.

There are some startup funds appropriated for the public option - $2 billion to set up the administration, and discretionary spending for the first 90 days (before premiums start rolling in). But that money is loaned, not given, and must be payed back to the federal government within 10 years. (See page 120, 222.b.2).

Lastly, I'd like to point out something which is not in the bill, but emerges from outside analysis of the public option. [It saves money](http://www.tnr.com/blog/the-treatment/exclusive-early-cbo-score-public-plan-its-good). By creating more competition, it drives down prices, which lowers the amount of money the government spends subsidizing insurance for people close to poverty or on medicaid.

There, now we all have a basic grasp of what the public option is - a government-administered not-for-profit, unsubsidized insurance plan to compete with other insurance plans on the health insurance exchange for individuals and small businesses. It does not cost money, and probably saves the government a significant amount of money overall.

Everyone clear? Good. 

Now we can argue about it.",finance,2009-09-09,-0.0092788356653928

politics,Godwin's favorite Obama E-mail forward...,"Who Am I
 
 I was born in one country, raised in another. My father was
 born in another country. I was not his only child. He
 fathered several children with several women. 

I became very close to my mother, as my father showed no
 interest in me. My mother died at an early age from cancer.
 
 
 Later in life, questions arose over my real name. 
 
 My birth records were sketchy and no one was able to
 produce a legitimate, reliable birth certificate. 
 
 I grew up practicing one faith but converted to
 Christianity, as it was widely accepted in my country, but I
 practiced non-traditional beliefs &amp; didn't follow
 Christianity, except in the public eye under scrutiny. 
 
 I worked and lived among lower-class people as a young
 adult, disguising myself as someone who really cared about
 them.. 
 
 That was before I decided it was time to get serious about
 my life and I embarked on a new career. 
 
 I wrote a book
  about my struggles growing up. It was clear to those who
 read my memoirs that I had difficulties accepting that my
 father abandoned me as a child. 
 
 I became active in local politics in my 30's then with
 help behind the scenes, I literally burst onto the scene as
 a candidate for national office in my 40s. They said I had a
 golden tongue and could talk anyone into anything. That
 reinforced my conceit. 
 
I had a virtually non-existent resume, little work history,
 and no experience in leading a single organization. Yet I
 was a powerful speaker and citizens were drawn to me as
 though I were a magnet and they were small roofing tacks. 
 
I drew incredibly large crowds during my publicappearances. This bolstered my ego. 
 
 At first, my political campaign focused on my country's
 foreign policy. I was very critical of my country in the
last war and seized every opportunity to bash my country. 
 
 But what launched my rise to national
  prominence were my views on the country's economy. I
 pretended to have a really good plan on how we could do
 better and every poor person would be fed &amp; housed for
 free. 
 
 I knew which group was responsible for getting us into this
 mess. It was the free market, banks &amp; corporations. I
 decided to start making citizens hate them and if they were
 envious of others who did well, the plan was clinched tight.
 
 
 I called mine ""A People's Campaign"" and that
 sounded good to all people. 
 
 I was the surprise candidate because I emerged from outside
 the traditional path of politics &amp; was able to gain
 widespread popular support. 

 I knew that, if I merely offered the people 'hope',

 together we could change our country and the world. 
 
 So, I started to make my speeches sound like they were on
 behalf of the downtrodden, poor, ignorant to include
 ""persecuted minorities"" like the Jews. My true
 views were not widely known and I
  needed to keep them unknown, until after I became my
 nation's leader. 
 
 I had to carefully guard reality, as anybody could have
 easily found out what I really believed, if they had simply
 read my writings and examined those people I associated
 with. 
 
 I'm glad they didn't. Then I became the most
 powerful man in the world. And the world learned the truth.

politics,"Hey Reddit, some people who disagree on health care aren't insane or racist!","I'm getting pretty tired of the insane racists oppose ObamaCare reddits. I'm calling bullshit. I agree that we need serious health care reform in the country. But I do not think creating another massive Federal bureaucracy is going to help anything. All it's going to do is create more debt and/or print more money, restrict access by bureaucracy, drive down quality, and cause loss of liberty, privacy and perhaps life.  I'm not a racist or a lunatic to think that. 

He claims insurance would be required ""like car insurance"". How is that enforced? Do you get stopped by the police with demands to see your insurance card? Do you get arrested when you show up at the hospital with a broken leg?  Does a computer at HHS spit out arrest warrants everyday when policies expire?  Anything requires hiring thousands of specialized police, guards and jail capacity, not to mention Constitutional challenges, and processing costs. Did he figure for this in his budget? 

He claims this will pay for itself through increased efficiency and fraud reforms. If history is any indicator, this cost saving program will not yield significant results, costs will run higher than expected, and this will require increasing tax payer funding.  It's neither insane nor racist to refuse to believe the government is going to efficiently do anything, much less pay for all this new bureaucracy. The program will have a cost, and the the bill will come due. 

How do we pay for this? We're broke.  Our currency has been rendered worthless. China Russia and the EU are literally propping up the dollar long enough to insulate themselves from the real economic disaster of a dollar collapse. Many people in these countries feel that the cost of taking on worthless US debt is cheaper than the human cost to the world of a bankrupt military superpower. 

So I'm sorry but the money just isn't there. Bush and his war cronies took it, Obama and his cronies took it, the bankers took it, and government employees took it. The money is gone. We've been looted, and even our credit has been maxed out ... like an identity theft.  We've been robbed, and left broke. You can't have health care, and there's a lot more you can't have now because the money for it has been stolen.  

If you were interested in real health care reform, we could be planning and debating a top to bottom rewrite of federal regulations removing all the market distortions paid for by lobbyists over the past 50 years. Barry mentioned a state where only one insurance company controls the entire State. Why is that?  Who wrote the regulations that allow for that, and who did they get money from?

politics,Hey /r/politics:  I need your help with a little local debate forum I've been having in my town,"Mostly, I'm just too lazy to compose my arguments, and I know there are people on here much more passionate than I.  SO!  Here is the text posted by the anti-health care package, show me how well Reddit debates!


The argument against health care:

You want to punish insurance companies? Make them compete.
Whenever two businessmen meet, ""the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to raise prices.""
That's why we need a third, fourth and 45th competing insurance company that will undercut them by offering better service at a lower price.
Tiny little France and Germany have more competition among health insurers than the U.S. does right now. Amazingly, both of these socialist countries have less state regulation of health insurance than we do, and you can buy health insurance across regional lines -- unlike in the U.S., where a federal law allows states to ban interstate commerce in health insurance.
Government-provided health care isn't a competitor; it's a monopoly product paid for by the taxpayer. Consumers may be able to ""choose"" whether they take the service -- at least at first -- but every single one of us will be forced to buy it, under penalty of prison for tax evasion. It's like a new cable plan with a ""yes"" box, but no ""no"" box. 

""A man lost his health coverage in the middle of chemotherapy because the insurance company discovered that he had gallstones, which he hadn't known about when he applied for his policy. Because his treatment was delayed, he died.""
Assuming this is true, in a free market, such an insurance company couldn't stay in business. Other insurance companies would scream from the rooftops about their competitor's shoddy business practices, and customers would leave in droves.
If that insurance company weren't required by law to cover early childhood development programs and sex-change operations, it wouldn't be forced to cut corners in the few areas not regulated by the government, such as cancer treatments for patients with gallstones.

The only reason most ""pre-existing"" conditions aren't already covered is because of government regulations that shrink the insurance market to a microscopic size, which leads to fewer options in health insurance and a lot more uninsured people than would exist in a free market.

Apparently, promising to cut costs by having a panel of Washington bureaucrats (for short, ""The Death Panel"") deny medical treatment wasn't a popular idea with most Americans. So they started claiming that they are going to cover an additional 47 million uninsured Americans and cut costs ... without ever denying a single medical treatment!
Also on the agenda is a delicious all-you-can-eat chocolate cake that will actually help you lose weight!
Everything that does not exist in infinite supply is rationed.
Under national health care, you'll have no choice about how to ration your own health care. If your neighbor isn't entitled to a hip replacement, then neither are you. At least that's how the plan was explained by our surgeon general. 

The last time it was decided an industry was so important that the government needed to step in and contain costs was when they set their sights on the oil industry. In both the U.S. and Canada -- presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter and Canadian P.M. Pierre Trudeau -- imposed price controls on oil.
As night leads to day, price controls led to reduced oil production, which led to oil shortages, skyrocketing prices for gasoline, rationing schemes and long angry lines at gas stations.
You may recall this era as ""the Carter years.""
Then, Ronald Reagan became president and immediately deregulated oil prices. The magic of the free market -- aka the ""profit motive"" -- produced surges in oil exploration and development, causing prices to plummet. Prices collapsed and remained low for the next 20 years, helping to fuel the greatest economic expansion in our nation's history.
You may recall this era as ""the Reagan years.""
Freedom not only allows you to make your own rationing choices, but also produces vastly more products and services at cheap prices, so less rationing is necessary. 

Despite being a thousand pages long, the health care bills passing through Congress are strikingly nonspecific. (Also, in a thousand pages, they weren't able to squeeze in one paragraph on tort reform. Perhaps they were trying to save paper.)
These are Trojan Horse bills. Of course, they don't include the words ""abortion,"" ""death panels"" or ""three-year waits for hip-replacement surgery.""
That proves nothing -- the bills set up unaccountable, unelected federal commissions to fill in the horrible details. Notably, the it was rejected an amendment to the bill that would specifically deny coverage for abortions.
After the bill is passed, the Federal Health Commission will find that abortion is covered, pro-lifers will sue, and a court will say it's within the regulatory authority of the health commission to require coverage for abortions.
Then we'll watch a parade of senators and congressmen indignantly announcing, ""Well, I'm pro-life, and if I had had any idea this bill would cover abortions, I never would have voted for it!"" 

Both Medicare and Bernie Madoff's investment portfolio are bankrupt because they operate on a similar financial model known as a ""Ponzi scheme."" These always seem to run fabulously well -- until the money runs out.
Not only is Medicare bankrupt, but it is extremely limited in whom and what it covers. If Medicare were a private insurer, it would be illegal in many states for failing to cover hearing aids, podiatry, acupuncture, chiropractic care, marriage counseling, aromatherapy and gender reassignment surgery.
National health care will eliminate everything outside of Medicare, which is the only thing that allows Medicare to exist. 

Technically, what Obama said is that the bill isn't ""designed"" to give health insurance to illegal aliens. (That bill, the ""Health Insurance for Illegal Aliens Act of 2009,"" was still being drafted by Ted Kennedy at the time of his death, may he rest in peace.)
But unless the various government bureaucracies dispensing health care are specifically required by law to ask about citizenship status, illegals will be covered. We can't even get employers and police to inquire about citizenship status, but congress assures us that doctors will?
And by the way -- as with the abortion exclusion -- they expressly rejected amendments that would have required proof of residency status to receive national health care.
On July 30 of this year, a House committee voted against a Republican amendment offered by Rep. Nathan Deal that would have required health care providers to use the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program to prevent illegal aliens from receiving government health care services. All Republicans and five Democrats voted for it, but 29 Democrats voted against it, killing the amendment. 

Politicians never, ever drop a heinous idea; they just change the name. ""Abortion"" becomes ""choice,"" ""communist"" becomes ""progressive,"" ""communist dictatorship"" becomes ""people's democratic republic"".
It doesn't matter if they start calling national health care a ""chocolate chip puppy"" or ""ice cream sunset"" -- if the government is subsidizing it, then the government calls the shots. And the moment the government gets its hands on the controls, it will be establishing death panels, forcing taxpayers to pay for abortions and illegal aliens, rationing care and then demanding yet more government control when partial government control creates a mess. 

Federal tax incentives have created a world in which the vast majority of people get health insurance through their employers.
Then to really screw ordinary Americans, the tax code actually punishes people who don't get their health insurance through an employer by denying individuals the tax deduction for health insurance that their employers get.
If congress really wanted people to be able to purchase health insurance when they move or lose a job as easily as they purchase car insurance and home insurance (or haircuts, dog walkers, cars, food, computers), they could do it in a one-page bill lifting the government controls and allowing interstate commerce in health insurance. This is known as ""allowing the free market to operate."" 

The ""public option"" trigger - Why does the government get to decide when the ""trigger"" has been met, allowing it to do something terrible to us? Either the government is better at providing goods and services or the free market is -- and I believe the historical record is clear on that.
Why not have a ""trigger"" allowing people to buy medical insurance on the free market when a trigger is met, such as consumers deciding their health insurance is too expensive? Or how about a trigger allowing us to buy health insurance from Utah-based
insurers -- but only when triggered by our own states requiring all insurance companies to cover marriage counseling, drug rehab and shrinks?",finance,2009-09-12,-0.1289260848864103

Economics,The Austrian Theory of the Business Cycle,"Hi guys,

I was wondering how many of you have heard of this and what you think of the theory.

If you don't know it, I've written a brief summary of the theory recently and I'll post it here:

""The core of the problem is the way new currency is created.  Understanding how our currency affects our economy is crucial, but not immediately obvious.  The injustice and destruction done by the current monetary system depends on the subject being dressed as beyond the intellectual grasp of the average voter in order to continue unnoticed.  In reality, the system is not especially difficult to understand once you side step the myriad of obfuscation, which has been built up around it to create a barrier that hides what’s really going on.

In order to properly introduce you to my understanding of the monetary system, it helps to begin with the history of money and the emergence of the relevant institutions we have today.  Money is about facilitating exchange, economic calculation, and store of value.  It grew out of the barter system primarily when the following problem presented itself: what if the other party to the exchange doesn’t want what I have to offer?  In this case, we introduce a third party who first has a good to trade that my counter party does want, and second wants the good I have to trade too.  In this way, we created a medium of exchange, and the good that the third party brought to the transaction becomes the currency.  Over time, we came to use various commodities as currency; always these were commodities that the actors in the economy knew could be exchanged for something of real value.  As markets merged, there was a tendency for a common currency to be used.  Due to their advantageous physical properties and stable, yet scarce, supply, gold and silver eventually became the most widely used currency.  

The use of a currency that is based on a commodity is called sound money.  In order to create more such currency it is necessary to apply economic resources to produce more of the commodity.  Sound money restricts the creation of new currency to honest means, and has been an enemy of the political classes for millennia.  The ability to create new money from nothing allows politicians to perform fiscal trickery on their people, and heavily favours the entities that receive special privileges and resources from government by allowing covert and corrupt appropriation of wealth from the people.

The first attempts by the political classes to get around this economic restriction on the creation of money focused on diluting the gold and silver content of coins (debasement), something that not coincidentally plagued the Roman Empire during its decline and fall.  This debasement allowed the political class to mint new coins and hence inflate the supply of money in the economy.  This ability to create money by political fiat enables the political class to extract wealth from the people without them being aware of it, in exactly the same way that someone in their basement with a counterfeiting press dishonestly acquires wealth when he spends his newly created money into the economy.  The ability to create money at will is extremely powerful and corrupting, responsible for so many of humanity’s ills, such as the enabling of war and the impoverishment of the working class, but I will only elaborate on one of them: the business cycle.

Over the years the methods by which the political classes have debased their currencies have changed and grown.   Our modern system uses two primary methods to inflate the money supply: fractional reserve banking and paper currency issuance from the central bank.  Fractional reserve banking is the practice of a bank only holding a fraction of its debt obligations.  There has been a lot of effort to cloud the issue of fractional reserve banking and provide legal justification for it, but the important result is a fact: you put some money into the banking system and it creates a multiple of new money based on the reciprocal of the reserve rate (usually 10%).  The central bank, which was created to combat the inherent instability and insolvency of the fractional reserve banking system (e.g. the repeated bank runs and collapses in 19th century America, before the Federal Reserve), has the ability to set the reserve rate of all banks and to create new paper money through the purchasing of debt.  The result is that the political creation of money in all major economies today runs rampant, more than at any other point in human history. 

So how does this relate to the business cycle?  Remember that money is ultimately just a commodity that’s being used as a medium of exchange.  Like any commodity, it is subject to the laws of supply and demand.  In an ideal situation, the supply of money is determined by the amount of money being saved and deposited in banks, and the borrowers in the economy determine the demand for money.  The price of money is the interest rate presented to borrowers and savers.  And again, just like any other commodity, manipulating the price against its economic equilibrium causes problems.  When the banking system creates money out of thin air, it presents it to be borrowed along side the real supply created by people saving money.  As a result, the supply of money is flooded and the price of borrowing is artificially lowered.  This has two principal effects: it discourages people from saving money, and it encourages people to borrow money.  Clearly, this dislocates the balance between savers and borrowers.

Why does this matter?  Well most obviously the lack of real savings to supply the borrowing means that something has to make up for the imbalance, and that is the money newly created out of debt.  This means that our economy will have a chronic and growing problem with debt, and it does.  The debt will grow so long as there is a borrowing binge and not enough savers, which is mainly characteristic of the boom years in the business cycle.  During a recession the market is simply trying to correct this imbalance by squeezing credit availability to borrowers and encouraging saving, both of which are vigorously fought against by the central bank, out of ignorance or otherwise.  The other important consequence is obvious once you realise that money itself is not wealth, it is the potential to claim wealth.  When people borrow money from the bank, they expect to be able to use it to purchase real things, but when that money does not correspond exactly to another person’s savings, we have claims on wealth that does not exist.  This in particular plays havoc with investors, who plan entrepreneurship and borrowing based on false information concerning the amount of real wealth available. The result is a boom in borrowing and investment in new ventures, and a corresponding boom in debt created at the same time.

But the laws of economics do not allow this situation to be sustainable.  There comes a point where the debt cannot be supported by the productive capability of an economy and through compound interest it grows out of control.  There comes a point where the people who borrowed and invested realise that they obtained less real wealth for their efforts than they had been led to believe.  A collapse ensues.  Each time the thing that triggers the collapse is different, but due to the insolvency inherent in fractional reserve banking, a game of musical chairs, very much lacking in chairs, begins.  This time the sub-prime mortgage market in America was the triggering problem where the first losses began, but it requires fractional reserve banking to turn that into a wholesale collapse of the banking system.  As the system unravels, money that was created by loans through fractional reserves is demanded back, which causes insolvency problems for the banks as they only recover a fraction of what they are owed.  With the globalisation of our markets and the fact that every major economy suffers the same monetary system, a sub-prime mortgage crisis in certain areas of America spreads into a global financial crisis.""",finance,2009-09-14,-0.3290839054039301

**EDIT** 
*Disclaimer*    
*I am pointing out that this is ridiculous. I do not agree with this at all.*




*This information is from an email passed onto me, and would love to share with everyone.

Dr. Charles Krauthammer is on Fox News. He is an M.D. and a lawyer and is paralyzed from the neck down. A friend went to hear Charles Krauthammer. He listened with 25 others in a closed room. What he says here, is NOT 2nd-hand but 1st. The ramifications are staggering for us, our children and their children.

Last Monday, Sep 7, was a profound evening, hearing Dr. Charles Krauthammer speak to the Center for the American Experiment. He is brilliant intellectual, seasoned &amp; articulate. He is forthright and careful in his analysis, and never resorts to emotions or personal insults. He is NOT a fear monger or an extremist in his comments and views. He is a fiscal conservative, and has received a Pulitzer Prize for writing. He is a frequent contributor to Fox News and writes weekly for the Washington Post. The entire room was held spellbound during his talk. I have summarized his comments, as we are living in uncharted waters economically and internationally. Even 2 Dems at my table agreed with everything he said! If you feel like forwarding this to those who are open minded and have not drunk the Kool-Aid, feel free.


Summary of his comments:

1. Mr. Obama is a very intellectual, charming individual. He is not to be underestimated. He is a cool customer who doesn't show his emotions. It's very hard to know what's behind the mask. The taking down of the Clinton dynasty by a political neophyte was an amazing accomplishment. The Clintons still do not understand what hit them. Obama was in the perfect place at the perfect time.

2. Obama has political skills comparable to Reagan and Clinton. He has a way of making you think he's on your side, agreeing with your position, while doing the opposite. Pay no attention to what he SAYS; rather, watch what he DOES!

3. Obama has a ruthless quest for power. He did not come to Washington to make something out of himself, but rather to change everything, including dismantling capitalism. He can't be straightforward on his ambitions, as the public would not go along. He has a heavy hand, and wants to level the playing field with income redistribution and punishment to the achievers of society. He would like to model the USA to Great Britain or Canada

4. His three main goals are to control ENERGY, PUBLIC EDUCATION, and NATIONAL HEALTHCARE by the Federal government. He doesn't care about the auto or financial services industries, but got them as an early bonus. The cap and trade will add costs to everything and stifle growth. Paying for FREE college education is his goal. Most scary is his healthcare program, because if you make it FREE and add 46,000,000 people to a Medicare-type single-payer system, the costs will go through the roof. The only way to control costs is with massive RATIONING of services, like in Canada. God forbid!

5. He has surrounded himself with mostly far-left academic types. No one around him has ever even run a candy store. But they are going to try and run the auto, financial, banking and other industries. This obviously can't work in the long run. Obama is not a socialist; rather he's a far-left secular progressive bent on nothing short of revolution. He ran as a moderate, but will govern from the hard left. Again, watch what he does, not what he says.

6. Obama doesn't really see himself as President of the United States, but more as a ruler over the world. He sees himself above it all, trying to orchestrate &amp; coordinate various countries and their agendas. He sees moral equivalency in all cultures. His apology tour in Germany and England was a prime example of how he sees America, as an imperialist nation that has been arrogant, rather than a great noble nation that has at times made errors. This is the first President ever who has chastised our allies and appeased our enemies!

7. He is now handing out goodies. He hopes that the bill (and pain) will not come due until after he is reelected in 2012. He would like to blame all problems on Bush from the past, and hopefully his successor in the future. He has a huge ego, and Dr. Krauthammer believes he is a narcissist.

8. Republicans are in the wilderness for a while, but will emerge strong. Republicans are pining for another Reagan, but there will never be another like him. Krauthammer believes Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty &amp; Bobby Jindahl (except for his terrible speech in February) are the future of the party. Newt Gingrich is brilliant, but has baggage. Sarah Palin is sincere and intelligent, but needs to really be seriously boning up on facts and info if she is to be a serious candidate in the future. We need to return to the party of lower taxes, smaller government, personal responsibility, strong national defense, and state's rights.

9. The current level of spending is irresponsible and outrageous. We are spending trillions that we don't have. This could lead to hyperinflation, depression or worse. No country has ever spent themselves into prosperity. The media is giving Obama, Reid and Pelosi a pass because they love their agenda. But eventually the bill will come due and people will realize the huge bailouts didn't work, nor will the stimulus package. These were trillion-dollar payoffs to Obama's allies, unions and the Congress to placate the left, so he can get support for #4 above.

10. The election was over in mid-September when Lehman brothers failed, fear and panic swept in, we had an unpopular President, and the war was grinding on indefinitely without a clear outcome. The people are in pain, and the mantra of change caused people to act emotionally. Any Dem would have won this election; it was surprising it was as close as it was.

11. In 2012, if the unemployment rate is over 10%, Republicans will be swept back into power. If it's under 8%, the Dems continue to roll. If it's between 8-10%, it will be a dogfight. It will all be about the economy. I hope this gets you really thinking about what's happening in Washington and Congress. There is a left-wing revolution going on, according to Krauthammer, and he encourages us to keep the faith and join the loyal resistance. The work will be hard, but we're right on most issues and can reclaim our country, before it's far too late.


Do yourself a long term favor; send this to all who will listen to an intelligent assessment of the big picture. All our futures and children's futures depend on our good understanding of what is really going on in DC, and our action pursuant to that understanding!!

politics,Why competition does not lower costs in the health insurance industry.,"I just spent an hour or so typing this out in order to [reply](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9m5tp/i_am_fucking_fed_up_with_these/c0dd35x) to a guy on a minor thread spawned by the ""[I am fucking fed up with these anti-universal-health-care, social Darwinist dickheads. Even WOLVES care for their sick and injured.](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/9m5tp/i_am_fucking_fed_up_with_these/)"" discussion.  It's not a topic that I know a *lot* about, but I get the impression that maybe I actually know a thing or two that most people don't realize.  And I was kinda disheartened by the prospect of only this one guy ever reading what I'd written.  So if you didn't trust the idea that insurance companies would provide better service for lower cost if only they were allowed to compete freely with each other in an unregulated market, but weren't really sure why it might be a bad idea, the following might be of interest to you.  (Likewise, if you believe that I'm a dangerously misinformed lunatic bent on destroying America.)

##Proposed:  That competition for market share would lower the cost of health insurance.##

-----

Believe it or not (and I'm sure that you do not) competition does not magically lower costs.  In an inelastic commodity market, it reduces profit-taking.  It does not automatically make corn cheaper to grow, although it will of course lead producers to seek cheaper ways to grow corn.  

Unfortunately, insurance companies are involved in the financial sector, rather than the agricultural sector.  People give them regular payments of money, which they then invest.  It is on those investments that they make their money.  The understanding is that there will be a payout if the money is needed for a particular reason.   

To increase their capital holdings, which both allows them to offer stable insurance and pursue greater investment profits,  insurance companies also rely upon *shareholders* to purchase and value stock in their companies.  

Unfortunately, competition for investment between entities promising to deliver profit by investing does rather the *opposite* of reducing profit-taking.  It *increases* profit taking, and in order to promise more profit than their rivals, especially during market upswings, the insurance companies are pressed to undertake riskier and riskier investment strategies.  When there is a major market downturn, the insurance companies are be doubly affected by the losses;  not only do they lose money on their investments, but their ability to leverage funds and otherwise operate flexibly in financial markets is impacted as investors become skeptical of their ability to deliver profits and the value of their stock drops.  (This of course directly impacts on their ability to deliver profits, possibly leading to greater skepticism, and so on, so this is something that they take very seriously.)

As a consequence, insurance companies in an unregulated market must turn their attention towards growing corn more cheaply.  This means providing less of a payoff than they had promised consumers when they were competing for their insurance dollars.  It means creating phone banks of insurance adjustors who earn bonuses based on how many claims they are able to deny.  It means employing legions of lawyers to fine-tune the balance between the potential ruinous cost to the individual of civil litigation and the mild expense to the company of no-fault, no-disclosure out of court settlements.  And this is why unregulated private insurance markets will always deliver you to exactly the situation you find yourselves in now.

I base my understanding on how the insurance industry works primarily upon conversations I have had with my brother in law, whom I should mention is the head of the research division of a major insurance company in an unrelated (and well-regulated) insurance market.",finance,2009-09-20,-0.200239627805208

politics,The Ant and Grasshopper,"THE ANT  AND THE GRASSHOPPER

 

This one is a little different...

Two Different Versions! .................  

Two Different Morals!
 
 
   OLD VERSION: The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long,  building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. 
 
 
   The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 
 
   Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. 
 
   The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.   
    
 
   MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself! 

 


 MODERN VERSION: 
 
 
   The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. 
 
 
   The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 
 
   Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold and starving. 
  
   CBS, NBC , PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a 
   video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food..   America is stunned by the sharp contrast.  
 
   How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? 
  

 Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing,

'It's Not Easy Being Green.'  
 
   Acorn stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house

where the news stations film the group singing, 'We shall overcome.'

Rev. Jeremiah Wright  then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's  sake. 
 
  
   Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid exclaim in an interview with Larry King that the ant has gotten rich off the back

of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share.   
 
   Finally, the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity &amp; Anti-Grasshopper Act retroactive to the beginning of the summer. 
 
 
   The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the Government Green  Czar. 
  
   The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the ants food while the government house

he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it. 
 
 
   The ant has disappeared in the snow. 
 
 
   The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident

and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders

who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood. 
 
 
 
MORAL OF THE STORY:  Be careful how you vote in 2010.

XMPP is only used for server-to-server federation of messages.  Imagine replacing SMTP between email servers with XMPP.  But the clients would still use POP/IMAP and so forth.  That's how to think of XMPP's role in Google Wave.

Google Wave really does rock.  I really like it.  But many people misunderstand its use of XMPP and how much code is really in the GWT-based client.  To make sense of it, I put together a [diagram](http://www.cubiclemuses.com/cm/articles/2009/08/09/waves-web-of-protocols/) of the various protocols involved.

        Subject: Guns you own to be itemized on your 2009 tax return

        Please read below and take action with your representatives.


        Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It may require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun. This bill was introduced on Feb 24. This bill will become public knowledge 30 days after it is voted into law. This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act of 1986. This means that the Finance Committee can pass this without the Senate voting on it at all. The full text of the proposed amendment is on the U.S. Senate homepage, http://www.senate..gov/ You can find the bill by doing a se arch by the bill number, SB-2099. You know who to call, &amp; I strongly suggest you do so. Please send a copy of this e-mail to every gun owner you know.

        &lt; http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h45/text

        Congress is now starting on the firearms confiscation bill. If it passes, gun owners will become criminals if you don't fully comply.

        It has started.

        Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House. This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sale Act of 2009.

        Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because the government is trying to fly it under the radar.

        To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get al l the information.

        Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless:

        It is registered -You are fingerprinted -You supply a current Driver's License -You supply yourSocial Security Number - You will submit to a physical &amp; mental evaluation at any time of their choosing - Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25 - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail. - There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18. - They would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.

        If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this. It is long and leng thy. But, more and more people are becoming aware of this. Pass the word along. Any hunters in your family pass                  this along.

        This is just a ""termite"" approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal is accomplished before anyone realizes it.

        This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not.

        &lt; http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.45 :

        &lt; http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h45/show

        &lt; http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-45

        Please.. copy and send this out to EVERYONE in the USA , whether you support

programming,"""Loop-and-a-half processing"": is this good style?","I'm in a Matlab class in college, but I've done a fairly good amount of programming self-education. We're talking about while loops, and the book talks about 'loop-and-a-half' processing where we 'enter the loop and perform some computation before realizing we do not need to continue. The example they give is as follows:

    R = 1;

Economics,An attempt at summarising the effects of fiscal policy on society,"I am not a trained economist at all. This is just what I have gathered from ""the internet"". I would really like to know
if this is an accurate depiction. Here it goes:

1. Government has 3 main sources of money:
a) Bonds: People or corporations voluntarily lend the government a lump sum of money, the government pays them interest on it
for a predefined timespan and eventually pays them back their investment.
b) Inflation: The government increases the supply of money through the central bank.
c) Taxation: People involuntarily pay the government a portion of their income and of many transactions they make.

2. Government has 5 main uses for money:
a) Investing in infrastructure
b) Paying bondholders interest.
c) Defense and security
d) Welfare
e) Bailouts

3. If we divide society into two groups, people earning less than the median income and people earning more than the median income,
we can list of the effects the above measures have on them:
	
Income:
a) Bonds:
People invest a higher proportion of their income the more money they have, so low income people will benefit less from the government borrowing money than high income people.

b) Inflation:
Since all money simultaniously decreases in value, there is no difference of the effect of this measure between the two groups.

c) Taxation:
Because, currently, a progressive tax system is in use in most places (as far as I know), the higher income people suffer more from taxation in proportion to their income than do low income people.
	
Spending:
a) Investing in infrastructure:
Since a higher proportion of high income people own businesses or are in a position to directly benefit monetarily from an improved infrastructure, one could say that, purely from a financial standpoint, they benefit more from this measure.

b) Paying bondholders interest:
As stated in 1, high income people benefit more from this than low income people, as they tend to have a higher percentage of their money invested.

c) Defense and security:
There is no relative difference between the effect of defence and security on low income vs. high income people,
even though there is an absolute difference, as theft and invasion prevention tends to benefit the rich more in
terms of absolute amounts of money than the poor. The effect of the military-industrial complex should also come up about equal for both groups, as low income people tend to be employed in the military, the police force and the defence industry than high income people, but high income people tend to own defence industry company stock
more than low income people (again, I am talking purely in terms of financial gain here and ignoring the murder/being killed in combat side of things deliberately, as that is not the topic here).

d) Welfare
Obviously, welfare benefits low income people more than high income people, even though high income people do sell products to people on welfare. However, I do not think these two aspects cancel each other out.

e) Bailouts
Since a bailout tends to prevent mass layoffs, this depends on the company. If the company is a bank, this will benefit high income people more. If the company is a car company, this will benefit low income people more, as the proportion of workers to managers in a car company is quite large. However, if the bailed out bank begins to lend people more money, this may benefit low income people. All this varies strongly from case to case. 
	
So, we have high income people benefiting more from: bonds, investing in infrastructure and paying bondholders interest.
Low income people benefit more (or suffer less) from taxation and welfare.
Since, technically, bonds and paying bondholders interest are two sides of the same coin, I can conclude that both low income
people and high income people have two aspects for, and two aspects against them. This allows

If government borrows more money and increases the money production, and simultaniously increases welfare and bails out a bank
that then goes on not to increase its lending, this benefits high income people more, as they benefit from the higher supply of bonds,
as the bond price then goes down and the government has to offer a better interest rate, while simultaniously benefiting from the
bank they work for not closing.

Now, I would like to thank you for reading through this long post, and would like to know where I am simply wrong (most likely bonds)
or where you disagree with me and why (most likely bailouts and inflation).",finance,2009-09-25,-0.0035710873681108

worldnews,"See the way Pittsburgh students, people and protesters are treated? Want it to stop? Vote.","Politicians need votes. Young people, those aged 18-25, don't give them many votes. Old people do, and old people get plenty of Government protection and assistance. Some may say that old people don't cause trouble, but, defining trouble as the cost to others they create, old people cause plenty. Young people drink and vandalize and do some silly (stupid) things. Older folks need medicine and financial assistance, because they cannot work. They often need these things because of what they did as young people. Not to say old people are a problem, but from the pragmatists view, they are not very different from young people.  Again however, politicians listen to those who will keep them in office, and old people vote more often.

Perhaps then, young people should vote. Fundamentalists were tapped by Regan for votes, and they kept them coming, and politicians did things like prevent safe-sex education, favoring what the fundamentalists favor, abstinence. So, if the largely untapped demographic aged between 18 and 25 years would vote, they would see some change.

But why get noticed when they only notice you for what you give them?
Because that is how our government works. If you want something done, you take action. Voting rights are what we have. Use them. They are your power, the way for you to exact change. Your leaders won't so quickly allow riot Police to beat on your heads when you put them out of a job. 

So, according to our little contracts with the government, the Bill of Rights, and even the Constitution, we get to vote. We absolutely get to elect 1/2 of 1/3 of our federal government, the House, and that is enough. States vary in terms of how secure your rights actually are, but its sensitive turf, and Politicians like to avoid that as much as possible. Accountability functions somewhat like natural selection, those who are most accountable, are most vulnerable. SO, when young people start holding our officials accountable on their terms, those most fit become less accountable. For the youth, that means laws and such. Measures that protect the youth formally, and would be effective if youth continued to be active. 
If you are young, band together. Make little movements. Then unite those. Vote. Pick someone and support them. Enough votes and you become valuable. Take a leaders job away because they don't have YOU with them. Then you will get what you deserve.",finance,2009-09-26,-0.0151988526404074

politics,[VIDEO] FIAT Currency Switch-a-roo: The US Dollar is being deliberately SUNK! The IMF is creating the New World Currency (SDR's) in lieu of the US Dollar. The FED is DEAD! and so is the US Dollar! Welcome to the New World Order...,"I came across this video a user posted on a Peter Schiff blog. Now it's clear to me why HR1207, the FRB Transparency act is getting further than it ever has before.

Apparently, the IMF is releasing SDRs in lieu of dollars (SDR new world currency?). The dollar is being sunk on purpose to make it necessary for these SDRs to have credibility. All our creditors will gladly exchange our dollars for these SDRs. The IMF is going to be the next defacto Central bank.

The IMF is printing currency (SDRs) without any backing (fiat currency) just like the Fed is doing.

So it all makes sense now. Instead of passing a transparency act in 1913 when it was needed, they pass it now when it's obsolete. In a statement Barney Frank (Chairman of the House Banking and Finance Committee) made, he said he supports HR1207 (Yet he's still not a co sponsor of the bill). Of course he supports it because he knows that in the unlikely chance it gets to the house floor for a vote, and the unlikely chance it gets through the Senate for an unlikely signatire by whatever puppet they have in the white house, it will still not have any teeth because the dollar is being supplanted by the new fiat SDR currency and the fed is being supplanted by the IMF.

Now 'all Guns' must be listed  on your next (2010) tax return!


As if we didnt have enough to get upset about!
If you have a gun, I hope it isn't registered!

Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It will require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun.

This bill was introduced on Feb.. 24, 2009, by the Obama staff.  BUT . .  this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective !   This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act o f 1986.  This means that the Finance Committee has passed this without the Senate voting on it at all.     Trust Obama ? ..... you must be kidding !     
|
The full text of the IRS amendment is on the U.S. Senate homepage,U.S. Senate &lt;http://www.senate.gov/&gt; You can find the bill by doing a search by the bill number, SB-2099.
| You know who to call; I strongly suggest you do. Please send a copy of this e-mail to every gun owner you know.|

&lt;Text of H.R.45 as Introduced in House: Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 - U.S.... OpenCongress &lt;http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h45/text&gt; |

Obama's Congress is now starting on the firearms confiscation bill. If it passes, gun owners will become criminals if you don't fully comply.

It has begun . . .  Whatever Obama's secret Master Plan is....this is just the 'tip of the iceburg!'

Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House. This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sale Ac t of 2009.|

Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because the government is trying to fly it under the radar as a 'minor' IRS revision, and, as usuual, the 'political' lawmakers did not read this bill befre signing and approving it !

To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get all the information.

Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle wit h a clip or ANY pistol unless:

-It is registered -You are fingerprinted -You supply a current Driver's License -You supply your Social Security # -You will submit to a physical &amp; mental evaluation at any time of their choosing -Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25 - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail. -There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18. -They would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.

If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many opt ions to read this. It is long and lengthy. But, more and more people are becoming aware of this. Pass the word along. Any hunters in your family pass this along.|

This is just a ""termite"" approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal is accomplished before anyone realizes it.

This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not..

gaming,Left-handed gamers consistently being left on the sidelines.,"I'm fed up with developers big and small leaving left-handed gamers out on the sidelines. For example, I bought Mass Effect a (long) while back, brought it home, and was very disappointed: 

&gt;In your recent title Mass Effect, I am disappointed by your decision to exclude an option to reverse the control scheme to a more left-handed format, such as swapping the move and look sticks. Because of this, your production is unplayable by me.
&gt;
&gt;I went to the local game store not too long ago and paid $49.99, only to bring it home, place it in the console, and find out that it's unplayable, with no warning of any sort on the back of the box. As you can see, it wasn't very enjoyable.
&gt;
&gt;I don't imagine that it takes very much effort to include a left-handed control scheme into your game, or to produce a patch for it for current games. If it's programmed correctly, all that is really necessary is to find the control module, and drop in a menu option to swap the analog sticks, and voila! You've just stopped disappointing 10% of your gaming populace.

Often times when I hop on Armor Games or one of its kindred, whatever developer of the game I'm about to play decides ""WASD to move, space to jump, mouse to aim, and left mouse to fire"", leaving me with a very interesting game that just slammed the door in my face.

It doesn't really take too much skill near the end of completion to modify the control catches to include a few more keys, or to make it a bit more modular to as to handle the changing about of controls.

This happens so often that I'm infuriated enough to bring it to the discriminating masses here and to have your thoughts and opinions on the matter. 

(Addendum: I love you, Bungee, for making Halo workable. Also Mass Effect cost me another $40 down the line when I bought it for PC. How is it that PC games can have control-swapping screens but not console games, again?)",technology,2009-10-08,-0.1772151326265529

gaming,"Story time, gaming.reddit. Share your most interesting experience in a game store, Target, or other retailer in regards to video games or otherwise. I'll start with a tale as to why customer service is important...","Hokay, so. I was searching for some used games at a local GameStop. I was just poking around, trying to find something new to rot my mind on. I found some PS2 games that caught my interest and I grabbed them. I get in line and behind the counter is this one young woman. There are two registers, but she's the only one actually working (the other guy was stocking or something).

There's three people in front of me and another two behind me and she takes roughly five full minutes to get through one person and then another seven to get through the next one. I wonder what's taking so long until I realize that she's on her cell phone. I quickly realize that it's not GameStop related but instead chitchat with whoever was on the other end (stuff like ""yeah... he's such a jerk.. whatever, I can do whatever I want... I love that movie, did you hear about the actor's son?"", and the like).

I'm almost at the front of the line. The person in front of me is obviously annoyed, as are the people behind me. She takes another 5 full minutes with this one in front of me, and by this time there are another two people queued up. People are getting miffed.

My turn comes up. I hand her the three games I'm getting and she leisurely takes her time going through the drawers, still on her cell phone, and puts my games into the cases. As a rule I ask to see the games before I buy them. She kind of rolls her eyes as I ask and hands me the cases before doing something at one of the registers. Two of the three games are in horrendous shape. I say ""I can't take these games, these are wrecked."" She puts a finger up and says ""I'm on the phone, hold on"". I give her a nasty look but decide to let it slide.. however... she continues to talk for a full minute before returning to cashing me out.

She rifles through the drawer, finds another disk and rings it through. I point out that she didn't even let me look at it and she does her eye roll again before handing back the case to me. The disk is almost as bad.

We're about seven minutes in here. I look at her and tell her flat out ""If you don't give me a better disk for this game, I'm not buying anything."" She looks at me incredulously and asks why and then, as if reading my mind the guy behind me whips out his cell phone and loudly starts talking: ""Hi Fred! Doing well, I'm just behind a guy in GameStop who's trying to get out of here like me! No, that's okay, I don't mind listening to you, go ahead, tell me about your day. Oh really? You too?"". I crack up and just put the games down and walk out, closely followed by two other guys, including the guy with the cell phone.

I went back the other day. She apparently no longer works there.

tl;dr version: Idiot GameStop employee takes way too long, talks on her cellphone during this time, pisses three customers off at once and pays for it in the end.",technology,2009-10-08,-0.1786667541563476

Lest you think it was written by some right-wing kook, David Kaiser is a respected historian whose published works have covered a broad range of topics, from European Warfare to American League Baseball. Born in 1947, the son of a diplomat, Kaiser spent his childhood in three capital cities:  Washington   D.C. ,  Albany ,  New York , and  Dakar ,  Senegal . He attended  Harvard   University , graduating there in 1969 with a B.A. In history. He then spent several years more at Harvard, gaining a PhD in history, which he obtained in 1976. He served in the Army Reserve from 1970 to 1976.

He is a professor in the Strategy and Policy Department of the  United States Naval War College  and has previously taught at Carnegie Mellon, Williams College  and  Harvard University . Kaiser's latest book, The Road to Dallas, about the Kennedy assassination, was just published by Harvard University Press.

History Unfolding
 
I am a student of history. Professionally, I have written 15 books on history that have been published in six languages, and I have studied history all my life. I have come to think there is something monumentally large afoot, and I do not believe it is simply a banking crisis, or a mortgage crisis, or a credit crisis. Yes these exist, but they are merely single facets on a very large gemstone that is only now coming into a sharper focus.

Something of historic proportions is happening. I can sense it because I know how it feels, smells, what it looks like, and how people react to it.. Yes, a perfect storm may be brewing, but there is something happening within our country that has been evolving for about ten to fifteen years. The pace has dramatically quickened in the past two.

We demand and then codify into law the requirement that our banks make massive loans to people we know they can never pay back? Why?

We learned just days ago that the Federal Reserve, which has little or no real oversight by anyone, has ""loaned"" two trillion dollars (that is $2,000,000,000,000) over the past few months, but will not tell us to whom or why or disclose the terms. That is our money. Yours and mine. And that is three times the $700 billion we all argued about so strenuously just this past September. Who has this money? Why do they have it? Why are the terms unavailable to us? Who asked for it? Who authorized it? I thought this was a government of ""we the people,"" who loaned our powers to our elected leaders. Apparently not.
 
We have spent two or more decades intentionally de-industrializing our economy. Why?
We have intentionally dumbed down our schools, ignored our history, and no longer teach our founding documents, why we are exceptional, and why we are worth preserving. Students by and large cannot write, think critically, read, or articulate. Parents are not revolting, teachers are not picketing, school boards continue to back mediocrity. Why?
 
We have now established the precedent of protesting every close election (violently in  California  over a proposition that is so controversial that it simply wants marriage to remain defined as between one man and one woman. Did you ever think such a thing possible just a decade ago?) We have corrupted our sacred political process by allowing unelected judges to write laws that radically change our way of life, and then mainstream Marxist groups like ACORN and others to turn our voting system into a banana republic. To what purpose?
 
Now our mortgage industry is collapsing, housing prices are in free fall, major industries are failing, our banking system is on the verge of collapse, social security is nearly bankrupt, as is medicare and our entire government. Our education system is worse than a joke (I teach college and I know precisely what I am talking about) - the list is staggering in its length, breadth, and depth.. It is potentially 1929 x  ten... And we are at war with an enemy we cannot even name for fear of offending people of the same religion, who, in turn, cannot wait to slit the throats of your children if they have the opportunity to do so.
 
And finally, we have elected a man that no one really knows anything about, who has never run so much as a Dairy Queen, let alone a town as big as  Wasilla ,  Alaska  . All of his associations and alliances are with real radicals in their chosen fields of employment, and everything we learn about him, drip by drip, is unsettling if not downright scary (Surely you have heard him speak about his idea to create and fund a mandatory civilian defense force stronger than our military for use inside our borders? No? Oh, of course. The media would never play that for you over and over and then demand he answer it. Sarah Palin's pregnant daughter and $150,000 wardrobe is more important.)
 
Mr. Obama's winning platform can be boiled down to one word: Change. Why?
 
I have never been so afraid for my country and for my children as I am now.
 
This man campaigned on bringing people together, something he has never, ever done in his professional life. In my assessment, Obama will divide us along philosophical lines, push us apart, and then try to realign the pieces into a new and different power structure. Change is indeed coming. And when it comes, you will never see the same nation again.

And that is only the beginning..
 
As a serious student of history,  I thought I would never come to experience what the ordinary, moral German must have felt in the mid-1930s. In those times, the ""savior"" was a former smooth-talking rabble-rouser from the streets, about whom the average German knew next to nothing. What they should have known was that he was associated with groups that shouted, shoved, and pushed around people with whom they disagreed; he edged his way onto the political stage through great oratory. Conservative ""losers"" read it right now.

And there were the promises. Economic times were tough, people were losing jobs, and he was a great speaker. And he smiled and frowned and waved a lot. And people, even newspapers, were afraid to speak out for fear that his ""brown shirts"" would bully and beat them into submission. Which they did - regularly. And then, he was duly elected to office , while a full-throttled economic crisis bloomed at hand - the Great Depression. Slowly, but surely he seized the controls of government power, person by person, department by department, bureaucracy by bureaucracy. The children of German citizens were at first, encouraged to join a Youth Movement in his name where they were taught exactly what to think. Later, they were required to do so. No Jews of course.

How did he get people on his side? He did it by promising jobs to the jobless, money to the money-less, and rewards for the military-industrial complex. He did it by indoctrinating the children, advocating gun control, health care for all, better wages, better jobs, and promising to re-instill pride once again in the country, across  Europe  , and across the world. He did it with a compliant media - did you know that? And he did this all in the name of justice and ..... . .. change. And the people surely got what they voted for.
 
If you think I am exaggerating, look it up. It's all there in the history books.
 
So read your history books. Many people of conscience objected in 1933 and were shouted down, called names, laughed at, and ridiculed. When Winston Churchill pointed out the obvious in the late 1930s while seated in the House of Lords in  England  (he was not yet Prime Minister), he was booed into his seat and called a crazy troublemaker. He was right, though. And the world came to regret that he was not listened to.
 
Do not forget that  Germany  was the most educated, the most cultured country in  Europe  . It was full of music, art, museums, hospitals, laboratories, and universities. And yet, in less than six years (a shorter time span than just two terms of the  U. S.  presidency) it was rounding up its own citizens, killing others, abrogating its laws, turning children against parents, and neighbors against neighbors .... all with the best of intentions, of course. The road to Hell is paved with them.
 
As a practical thinker, one not overly prone to emotional decisions, I have a choice: I can either believe what the objective pieces of evidence tell me (even if they make me cringe with disgust); I can believe what history is shouting to me from across the chasm of seven decades; or I can hope I am wrong by closing my eyes, having another latte, and ignoring what is transpiring around me..
 
I choose to believe the evidence. No doubt some people will scoff at me, others laugh, or think I am foolish, naive, or both. To some degree, perhaps I am. But I have never been afraid to look people in the eye and tell them exactly what I believe-and why I believe it.
 
I pray I am wrong. I do not think I am. Perhaps the only hope is our vote in the next elections.

politics,"I emailed my senator(Kyl, R-AZ) about why he was against the public option, and this was his response:","Thank you for contacting me regarding health care reform.  I appreciate the opportunity to respond.  

The U.S. health care system is the best in the world, spurring advancements in new medical treatments and technologies.  Such innovation helps physicians treat and prevent diseases better than ever before, eradicates once fatal epidemics, and helps Americans lead longer, healthier lives.  
Despite these advances, millions of Americans struggle to find affordable health insurance options.  From 1999 to 2008, the average cost of a family health plan increased by 119 percent from $5,791 to $12,680.  Meanwhile, workers' wages increased 34 percent during the same nine-year period.  Ensuring access to quality, affordable health care is a laudable goal.  I support targeted solutions that lower health care costs and improve health care by building upon, not completely dismantling, our health care system.  
Unfortunately, many of the proposals being considered in the U.S. Senate will make health insurance more expensive, jeopardize Arizonans' current coverage, and expand the government's control over health care.  While you will not find the words ""ration,"" ""withhold coverage,"" or ""delay access to care"" in the pending plans, that is what will result from the web of federally-dictated insurance reforms, new legal obligations, and provider reimbursement schemes that are part of them.  Such policies centralize the power of medical decisions with politicians and bureaucrats, not patients and doctors, and they will result in the delay or denial of care.

There are three main problems with the Majority party's proposals: the implementation of a government-run insurance plan, the use of comparative effectiveness research, and spending.  

Government-Run Insurance Plan
 
First, the Majority's proposals would create a new, government-run health insurance plan to compete against private insurance plans.  The argument is that a government-run plan would give consumers a better range of choices and make the health care market more competitive -- ""keep the insurance companies honest,"" as the President put it.  However, well-respected, independent analysis provides evidence to the contrary.   For one thing, a government-run plan would be subsidized by the taxpayers, giving the government plan a huge advantage over competitors.  Yet, even government resources are not unlimited.  To save money after tens of millions of people are added to the public plan, the government would cut reimbursement to doctors and hospitals, exacerbating the difficulty Arizonans' already encounter in trying to schedule doctor appointments.  To make up for low government reimbursements to providers, insurance companies would have to charge more for private insurance, making it less attractive than the government plan.
Over time, there will only be room for the government plan according to the respected Lewin Group, as 119 million Americans would lose their current coverage.  Remember, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were designed as independent ""government-sponsored enterprises"" to complement the private mortgage market.  Now, Fannie and Freddie account for a combined share of 73 percent of mortgage originations in the second half of 2008.  The two ""government-sponsored enterprises"" are now effectively owned and run by the federal government, after having sustained losses of over $100 billion last year alone.  A Washington-run health care plan will do to the health care market what Fannie and Freddie did to the housing market.

Comparative Effectiveness Research  

Second, the Majority's plan would create a new research entity to conduct so-called comparative effectiveness research (CER).  CER is a mechanism used by medical professionals to provide information on the relative strengths and weaknesses of various procedures and treatments.  In the hands of doctors, medical researchers, and other health professionals, CER can help patients and their own doctors make informed health care decisions.  However, in the hands of government, CER can become a tool to delay or deny care.  For example, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Effectiveness in Britain uses ""cost-effectiveness research"" to make health care decisions.  By basing treatment decisions on cost rather than need, Britain prescribes fewer cancer drugs than any of the other big five European nations; its patients therefore have the lowest survival rate according to a May edition of National Review.  The UK's system provides only half of the care for end-stage renal disease patients that we do in the United States.  Obviously, such rationing of care is not something we should replicate in the United States.       

It is telling that none of the Majority's proposals in Congress would bar the federal government from using CER to deny access to care.  In fact, when I offered an amendment in April to explicitly bar the use of CER to ration care, it was defeated on a near party-line vote.  I have now introduced a free standing bill to ensure that any information obtained through CER cannot be used to deny access to care.  The Preserving Access to Targeted, Individualized, and Effective New Treatments and Service (PATIENTS) Act of 2009 (S. 1259) will protect the doctor-patient relationship and ensure access to the highest quality medical care.  I will fight at every opportunity to ensure that any health care reform plan the Senate considers later this year protects patients' access to care.                         

Cost     

Finally, the Majority's plans would cost between $1 trillion and $2 trillion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.  But even that may understate the true cost.  Consider that Massachusetts enacted near universal health insurance in 2006, and costs have exploded, doubling from $630 million in 2007 to an estimated $1.3 billion just two years later.  To deal with those costs, the state has decided to slow enrollment of beneficiaries and eliminate dental coverage for its poorest residents.  A special commission, which was established by the state legislature, has now recommended limiting coverage to those health care services that government deems to be ""cost-effective""-just like government-run health systems in other nations such as Canada and Great Britain do.  This will quickly lead to rationing.

Furthermore, the plans would be financed by a combination of new taxes and cuts in Medicare spending, hurting seniors' access to care.  The Medicare Trust Fund is already expected to reach bankruptcy by 2017, so taking money from Medicare to fund a huge expansion of health care benefits for others makes no sense.

Alternatives    
Rather than upending the entire health care system, we should identify what specific problems exist and consider targeted solutions to lower costs and improve access to care.  For example, medical liability reform must be part of any reform effort.  Of course, malpractice lawsuits serve a valuable purpose for those who have truly been wronged, but malpractice law is often abused by some trial lawyers who flood courts with baseless lawsuits. The threat of these lawsuits against doctors is a big reason Americans' health-care premiums have soared.

Many physicians must purchase expensive malpractice insurance -- sometimes at a cost of more than $200,000 a year -- just to keep their doors open. Hudson Institute economist Diana Furchtgott-Roth estimates that 10 cents of every dollar paid for health care goes toward the cost of doctors' malpractice insurance, with much of the cost passed on to patients. 

Additional costs are passed on as a result of the practice of ""defensive medicine.""  Many doctors take extra, or defensive, precaution when treating patients, ordering tests or procedures that may not be needed, but will help protect them if they are sued. A 2008 study from the Massachusetts Medical Society reported that 83 percent of doctors said they order tests, procedures, and referrals solely as protection from lawsuits. According to a study by two Stanford economists, the use of defensive medicine increases Americans' medical costs by $100 billion a year. 

In addition to tort reform, the federal government should remove barriers that limit consumers' ability to shop for quality coverage at a more affordable price.  For example, the government should permit the sale of health insurance across state lines to increase competition among insurers.   Small businesses should be able to band together to form small business health plans to strengthen their purchasing power and negotiate affordable rates and coverage options for their employees.

Additionally, individuals who purchase their own health insurance should receive the same tax incentives large businesses do.  By promoting the use of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), we could encourage more responsible health care spending and allow individuals to take their coverage with them when they move from one job to another.  We should also incentivize healthy behaviors and encourage catastrophic coverage.  Finally, we should allow each state to pursue innovative health insurance market reforms tailored to its own needs to encourage competition and choice.
I believe in the right of every American to choose the doctor, hospital, and insurance plan of his or her choice.  No Washington bureaucrat should interfere with that right or substitute the government's judgment for that of a physician.  Any health reform proposal should adhere to these principles.

politics,I hate political chain letters,"ORIGINAL CHAIN LETTER:

Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize this morning. Over the last decade the only requirement to win the prize was that the nominee had to be critical of George W. Bush (see Al Gore, Mohamed El Baradei and Jimmy Carter).President Obama has broken new ground here. Nominations for potential winners of the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize ended on February 1. The president took office only 12 days earlier on January 20.Let’s take a look at the president’s first 12 days in the White House according to his public schedule to see what he did to deserve a Nobel Peace Prize:January 20: Sworn in as president. Went to a parade. Partied.January 21: Asked bureaucrats to re-write guidelines for information requests. Held an “open house” party at the White House.January 22: Signed Executive Orders: Executive Branch workers to take ethics pledge; re-affirmed Army Field Manual techniques for interrogations; expressed desire to close Gitmo (how’s that working out?)January 23: Ordered the release of federal funding to pay for abortions in foreign countries. Lunch with Joe Biden; met with Tim Geithner.January 24: Budget meeting with economic team.January 25: Skipped church.January 26: Gave speech about jobs and energy. Met with Hillary Clinton. Attended Geithner's  swearing in ceremony.January 27: Met with Republicans. Spoke at a clock tower in Ohio.January 28: Economic meetings in the morning, met with Defense secretary in the afternoon.January 29: Signed Ledbetter Bill overturning Supreme Court decision on lawsuits over wages. Party in the State Room. Met with Biden.January 30: Met economic advisers. Gave speech on Middle Class Working Families Task Force. Met with senior enlisted military officials.January 31: Took the day off.February 1: Skipped church. Threw a Super Bowl party.So there you have it. The short path to the Nobel Peace Prize: Party, go to meetings, skip church, release federal funding to pay for abortions in foreign countries, party some more.Good grief.


MY RESPONSE:

The very premise of this chain letter shows that whoever wrote this has NO idea how or why Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize in the first place.  They are deliberately or non-deliberately ignorant and could care less either way.  Just to be clear, whether or not he deserved it is a completely separate issue which is not addressed in this email.  I personally question the decision myself.  What is presented however are cherry-picked anecdotal accusations, a few false claims, and logical fallacies written by someone who obviously dislikes Obama, and is poorly disguised as an intelligent argument.

The claim introduced is that Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize because of his actions during the first twelve days in office as the President of the United States.  Of course, anyone can see this is silly.  Perhaps the most obvious reason is that one need not become the president of anything to be considered for such an award.  He wasn’t nominated because he became president.  The rest of the claim is completely inaccurate as well.  He wasn’t awarded the prize because of his first twelve days as president either.  He was nominated on the twelfth day because of his actions that preceded that date, not limited to day one through twelve.  Furthermore, the ‘twelfth day’ everyone is so concerned about is an arbitrary number with no significant value; it could’ve been the eleventh or the four-hundredth… it just happened to be on the twelfth day he was in office that the Nobel committee decided on their nominations.  I’m still unsure why people are so obsessed with that day.  I guess everyone needs their symbolic catchphrase to latch onto when their argument fails to stand up on its own to logical criticism.

So why was Obama nominated?  The Nobel committee chooses a person who has made the biggest difference in the previous year.  What is conveniently forgotten is that Obama, for at least the year prior, had been delivering his message of peace and rallied a following of a very large number of people who eventually elected him as their president.  He re-engaged the majority of the United States as well as many others around the world with his audacity of hope with the message of ‘Yes We Can’.  The Nobel committee recognized Obama's efforts at dialogue to solve complex global problems, including working toward a world free of nuclear weapons.  ""Only very rarely has a person to the same extent as Obama captured the world's attention and given its people hope for a better future,"" the committee said.  This, and his many other lifetime achievements to help others and bring peace, no matter how small, is the reason he was nominated.  Did these actions merit a Nobel Nomination?  It is arguable, but justifiable nonetheless.

The most important point I’d like to make: Obama didn't ASK for this nomination.  It was awarded to him without his knowledge.  We mustn’t hold it against him personally which is exactly what the author is trying to do.  Obama was awarded a prize for trying to promote peace (which is a GOOD thing remember?) and the author is holding it against him!  I'm pretty sure many people (including Obama) agree that Obama's winning of the Nobel Prize is at least interesting - at most undeserved - so where is the argument?  It has NOTHING to do with Obama himself, rather the questions lie with the Nobel Committee (see 1 below).  The committee wanted to promote the president just as it had Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 for his efforts to open up the Soviet Union.  Furthermore, Obama said himself he did not feel he deserved ""to be in the company"" of past Peace Prize winners, but would accept the prize while pushing for a broad range of international objectives, including nuclear nonproliferation, a reversal of the global economic downturn and a resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict. ""This award is not simply about my administration,"" he said. It ""must be shared"" with everyone who strives for ""justice and dignity.""  If anything, the author should be upset with the Nobel committee, not Obama.  

Even though the specific lines of 'evidence' in the chain letter have nothing to do with the issue at hand, I’ll quickly address.  Since the author blatantly illustrates his/her conservative bias and feels that a Super Bowl party is something to be concerned with, I’d like to remind them that it was a planned bipartisan Super Bowl party hosted by the White House (http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog_post/BipartisanSuperBowlParty/) and that President Bush spent a total of 977 days on ‘vacation’ (http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/01/16/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry4728085.shtml).  Parties and vacations are part of being human as well as being president.
As far as going to church, he very well might not have… I’m sure he didn’t go to Temple either.  I’m sure he didn’t attend any number of worship centers… Point is, there IS such a thing as Separation of Church and State (see 2 below) whether you choose to believe it or not (which in my opinion should be enforced to a greater extent – there is not only one faith in America which people so easily forget).  He can go, or not go, to any church/synagogue/mosque/temple/shrine he pleases and it shouldn’t matter to anyone else but him.  I understand that he considers himself a christian and many believe that christians should attend church every sunday however, faith is not in a floor plan… one doesn’t need to attend church to pray or to worship – I’m sure the author hasn’t been to church every Sunday of his/her life either.  I would even venture to say that if he was signing a tax rebate bill where everyone would receive money, he/she would have little or no criticism as to why he wasn't attending church.  The point is, the author is picking out certain activities through special pleading and ad-hoc reasoning to make their argument appear more valid.  Again, what Obama did during his first twelve days is irrelevant to why he received the Nobel Peace Prize.

To whomever wrote this: don’t you have anything else better to do?  If you disapprove of President Barack Obama, I’m sure there are plenty of other more respectable false accusations you can parrot other than this one.

1) Nominations are not tallied up by popular votes and then whoever has the most wins.  It's decided by the members of the Nobel Committee.
The statutes of the Nobel Foundation specify categories of individuals who are eligible to make nominations for the Nobel Peace Prize. These are:
- Members of national assemblies and governments and members of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
- Members of the Permanent Court of Arbitration and the International Court of Justice at the Hague.
- Members of Institut de Droit International.
- University professors of history, political science, philosophy, law and theology, university presidents and directors of peace research international affairs institutes.
- Former recipients, including board members of organizations that have previously won the prize.
- Present and past members of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.
- Former permanent advisers to the Norwegian Nobel Institute.


2) The phrase ""separation of church and state"" is derived from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson in 1802 to a group identifying themselves as the Danbury Baptists. In that letter, referencing the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, Jefferson writes:
“Believing with you that religion is a matter which lies solely between Man &amp; his God, that he owes account to none other for his faith or his worship, that the legitimate powers of government reach actions only, &amp; not opinions, I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should ""make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,"" thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State.”",energy,2009-10-16,-0.03211235822507

politics,"I emailed Senator Crapo (R-ID) about his vote against the Franken Amendment, here is his response.","Thank you for contacting me regarding arbitration agreements in federal contracts. I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.
 
As you know, Senator Al Franken (D-Minnesota) introduced an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2010 Defense Authorization bill that would prohibit the use of funds for any federal contract with Halliburton Company, KBR, Inc., any of their subsidiaries or affiliates, or any other contracting party if such contractor or a subcontractor at any tier under such contract requires that employees or independent contractors sign mandatory arbitration clauses regarding certain claims. The amendment would apply to any new or existing federal contract. The Senate adopted the amendment, with my dissent, by a vote of 68 to 30. 
 
My vote against this amendment was a careful consideration of the legal, retroactive and precedent-setting problems that the proposal presented, balancing my concerns against undermining legal rights to justice and recourse. It would be wrong to cite this amendment as a vote on anything other than the relationship between a private contractor and the federal government.  Congress should not set a precedent of retroactively changing contractual rights.
  
Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have been an aggressive advocate for legislation to prevent violence against women and families, including providing federal funding in a lock box for violence prevention and education programs, expending federal actions that can be taken in domestic and dating violence cases; and advocating successfully for funding that facilitated the opening of the FACES Center in Boise, a one-stop crisis center for response to sexual and domestic violence against women. I will continue to support efforts to protect women and families from abuse and crime, while maintaining and individual's legal rights to justice. 

I responded with:
Senator Crapo,
 
The full text is as follows:
 
Sec. 8104. (a) None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this Act may be used for any existing or new Federal contract if the contractor or a subcontractor at any tier requires that an employee or independent contractor, as a condition of employment, sign a contract that mandates that the employee or independent contractor performing work under the contract or subcontract resolve through arbitration any claim under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 or any tort related to or arising out of sexual assault or harassment, including assault and battery, intentional infliction of emotional distress, false imprisonment, or negligent hiring, supervision, or retention. 
 
My take on this is that existing contracts which have already been allocated funds will still retain their funding.  Future contracts funded with money set aside by this bill will not be used for companies using binding arbitration in such cases.  Nothing of this amendment states Haliburton, KBR or any of its subsidaries specifically.  I'm assuming there are contracts waiting for funding and this bill is to allocate funds to them, hence the mention of existing Federal contracts.  I do not see your point of retroactively changing agreements.

I'll keep you guys up to date with what he says.  Also I have emailed Senator Risch (R-ID) for the same reason, haven't heard back yet.",finance,2009-10-19,0.0007857196208622

politics,"I wrote to my representative, the long time 
incumbent  Jeff Sessions of Alabama regarding 
health care and my support of a public option. This 
was his response.","Thank you for your recent letter regarding national health care reform. As you know, President Obama has announced his intention to sign a health care reform bill into law before the end of this year. 

I agree that our health care system is broken and in need of real, substantive reform. I share your concerns about the rising cost of health insurance and the increasing number of Americans that are unable to afford quality health care, and I am committed to working on health care initiatives that will address this problem. 

I believe that proposals centering on government-run health care are troubling becuase they would put the government beween doctors and patients, compromising patient choice and access to care, Implementing a ""public plan option"" that allows individuals to opt-in to a government-managed health plan would create a multitrillion-dollar entitlement program that would greatly expand the role of the federal government in every aspect of the health care industry. 

Many health experts contend that instead of reducing costs and increasing the quality of care, a public option health care plan that follows the Medicare model would instead lead to a drastic decrease in payments to doctors and hospitals. The costs for these underpayments have long been shifted onto private payers in the form of higher charges. However, experts contend that 119 million Americans--fully two-thirds of the 170 million Americans that currently are covered by private insurance--would abandon private coverage in favor of lower costs promised by a government-run option. Doctors, nurses, and hospitals would be forced to see more patients with reduced pay--hardly a model of successful reform. 

I recognize that a ""one-size-fits-all"" approace is insufficient to address the varying medical situations of all Americans. Therefore, I do not believe that a subsidized government health plan that would crowd out private insurance and eliminate market competition--leaving government-run health coverage as the only alternative--is the best way forward. Instead, we must rely on ideas that ensure patients, not government bureaucrats, are in charge of their health care. 

Please be assured that I will keep your views on this important subject in my mind as my colleagues and I consider health care legistlation in the coming weeks and months.

politics,Alaska again seeks delisting of polar bears as threatened,"Listing could stall development of oil, governor says.

 Attorney General Dan Sullivan announced Wednesday he has filed a supplement to the state's earlier lawsuit in federal court in Washington, D.C. In it, the state claims the U.S. Department of Interior did not respond to the state's concerns in a timely manner before polar bears were listed last year.

Former Gov. Sarah Palin and the state filed an initial lawsuit in August 2008, fearing a listing would cripple offshore oil and gas development in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas, which provide prime habitat for the only polar bears under U.S. jurisdiction.

Gov. Sean Parnell, who succeeded Palin upon her resignation last summer, joined Sullivan at a news conference in which they said the Endangered Species Act was being used as a way to shut down resource development along Alaska's northern coast. Parnell said he does not intend to let that happen.

Economics,"If the Federal Reserve's purpose were really to ""control inflation"", then why doesn't it simply issue every American citizen a periodic check for however many dollars is required to increase prices by 2 to 3% each year?","This is my thought process:

One of the Federal Reserve's stated goals is to ""control inflation"".  The way it currently does this is by conducting open market operations in the debt market which affects the short term market rate of interest, and this interest rate regulates the extent to which businesses invest in projects.  If the Fed wants the market to cut back on investments, it will increase interest rates by printing less money.  If the Fed wants the market to engage in more investment, it will decrease interest rates by printing more money.  These actions supposedly affect the overall rate of business spending, and hence the rate of increase in prices.

However since the Fed targets the rate of increase in consumer prices, wouldn't it make more sense to simply issue everyone periodic checks that are not loan based, but simply checks drawn on itself, which will have the effect of increasing the quantity of money and hence volume of spending in the economy, and thus raise consumer prices that way in a more direct sense?

If the Fed wants to make consumer prices rise by 2 to 3% each year, and it expects that people are going to cut back on consumer spending in the coming months or years, then it would simply issue checks for larger amounts.  If the Fed expects that people are going to soon splurge on consumer spending in the coming months, then it would simply issue checks for smaller amounts, or none at all.

If the Fed were really concerned with controlling inflation, is this not the quickest and simplest method for controlling the rate of increase in prices?  Why does the Fed have to go the long, time delayed route of buying securities from primary dealers, thus increasing total bank reserves, which then provide a basis for the banks in making more loans, which lowers interest rates, which stimulate business expenditures, which then translates into higher incomes, which then goes into higher demand for consumer goods, which then, finally, raises consumer prices, all the while messing up business calculations and creating bubbles?

Does this little mental experiment not show inflation supporters that the Fed really isn't concerned with inflation so much as ensuring that the banks make a profit from it in the meantime?  Won't giving checks to people have exactly zero net effect on the economy, which proves that the economy does not in fact ""need"" a gradually increasing monetary demand with which to grow?",finance,2009-10-26,0.0205950375509963

Shortly after its release, PGP encryption found its way outside the United States, and in February 1993 Zimmermann became the formal target of a criminal investigation by the US Government for ""munitions export without a license"". Cryptosystems using keys larger than 40 bits were then considered munitions within the definition of the US export regulations; PGP has never used keys smaller than 128 bits so it qualified at that time. Penalties for violation, if found guilty, were substantial. After several years, the investigation of Zimmermann was closed without filing criminal charges against him or anyone else.
Zimmermann challenged these regulations in a curious way. He published the entire source code of PGP in a hardback book[10], via MIT Press, which was distributed and sold widely. Anybody wishing to build their own copy of PGP could buy the $60 book, cut off the covers, separate the pages, and scan them using an OCR program, creating a set of source code text files. One could then build the application using the freely available GNU C Compiler. PGP would thus be available anywhere in the world. The claimed principle was simple: export of munitions—guns, bombs, planes, and software—was (and remains) restricted; but the export of books is protected by the First Amendment. The question was never tested in court with respect to PGP. In cases addressing other encryption software, however, two federal appeals courts have established the rule that cryptographic software source code is speech protected by the First Amendment (the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Bernstein case and the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Junger case).
US export regulations regarding cryptography remain in force, but were liberalized substantially throughout the late 1990s. Since 2000, compliance with the regulations is also much easier. PGP encryption no longer meets the definition of a non-exportable weapon, and can be exported internationally except to 7 specific countries and a named list of groups and individuals (with whom substantially all US trade is prohibited under various US export controls).",technology,2009-10-27,-0.095224140034571

&gt; Dear Friend:
&gt; 
&gt; Thank you for contacting me regarding equal and unrestricted access to the Internet. I welcome your thoughts and comments on this issue.
&gt; 
&gt; The Internet is a valuable tool that facilitates business, education, and recreation for millions of Americans. In 2008, an estimated 220 million Americans had access to the Internet at home or work. As Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am committed to ensuring that consumers benefit from competition in the telecommunications industry, resulting in lower prices, improved service, and access to 21st century technology.
&gt; 
&gt; Instrumental to the success of the Internet is the longstanding policy of keeping the Internet as free as possible from burdensome regulations. Increased investment in upgrading and expanding America’s Internet infrastructure, as well as innovative new broadband networks, will ensure that all Americans have access to affordable high-speed Internet. However, intensified regulation of the Internet, such as congressionally mandated treatment of data, would stifle competition and would decrease the incentive for network operators to invest in the Internet infrastructure. 
&gt; 
&gt; It is my concern that mandates that prevent network providers from managing congestion on the Internet will reduce service speeds for many users, and eliminate a valuable tool for ensuring the most efficient use of network pipelines, resulting in increased costs to the consumer. In a June 2007 report on the issue of “network neutrality”, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated that no “demonstrated consumer harm from conduct by broadband providers” had occurred due to network providers managing Internet traffic. More recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a decision involving Comcast and certain network management practices. While this decision works its way through the courts, Congress may continue reviewing network practices and Internet congestion issues.
&gt; 
&gt; Should any legislation regarding Internet access come before the Senate Commerce Committee, you may be assured I will keep your views in mind. I appreciate hearing from you, and I hope that you will not hesitate to keep in touch on any issue of concern to you.

politics,Lieberman's response to Net Neutrality,"Dear [REDACTED]:

 

Thank you for contacting me regarding the issue of net neutrality.  It was good to hear from you.

 

I support the objectives of net neutrality, which holds that data from all Internet content providers should be treated equally, regardless of the provider or the content.  Broadband service providers, including cable, telephone companies, and wireless providers, have indicated in the past a desire to charge Internet content and application providers for delivering content to Internet consumers.  Such efforts could have an adverse impact on consumers who may not have unfettered access to the content of their choosing when using the Internet.

 
In September 2005, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) adopted a policy statement that outlined four broad principles to ""encourage broadband deployment and preserve and promote the interconnected nature of public Internet.""  These principles state that consumers should be entitled to access the lawful Internet content of their choice, run the Internet applications and services of their choice, connect to their choice of legal devices that will not harm the network, and benefit from open competition among Internet service providers (ISPs).  While the FCC did not officially adopt these principles or ask Congress to codify these principles into law, the Commission did state that these rules would be incorporated into its rulemaking process.  For example, last August the FCC ordered Comcast to cease blocking select peer-to-peer file transmissions on its network in an attempt to manage traffic because it would interfere with users' rights to access lawful Internet content and to use the applications of their choice.   

 
This past September, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski announced that he intended to propose to his fellow commissioners that FCC set forth regulations adopting the four principles as official agency policy.  In addition, Chairman Genachowski introduced two new principles:   ""non-discrimination"" and ""transparency.""  The non-discrimination principle would prohibit ISPs from favoring certain Internet applications or content over others.  ISPs would also be prohibited from discriminating against a lawful Internet service just because it competes with a similar service offered by the ISP.  The transparency principle would require ISPs to be transparent about how they manage their network's traffic. 

 

On October 22, 2009, the FCC voted unanimously to begin crafting rules that will implement these six principles into law.  The FCC will now be seeking public comments on this proposal until January 14, 2010, at which point the agency will begin to draft final rules that will eventually be submitted to the Commission for final approval.  If you are interested in submitting your views on this matter, you may do so through FCC's Electronic Comment Filing System at http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs2/upload/display?z=mludu.  This link will take you directly to a form that can be used to submit your thoughts on this specific proposal (Docket No. 09-191; In the Matter of Preserving the Open Internet Broadband Industry Practices).  

 

Net neutrality is one of many issues that have been the subject of hearings held by the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation with regard to telecommunications reform legislation.  I favor bipartisan legislation, such as the Internet Freedom Preservation Act (S. 215), which was introduced last Congress by Senators Olympia Snowe (R-ME) and Byron Dorgan (D-ND).  Senator Dorgan has said that he and Senator Snowe intend to introduce similar legislation later this Congress, incorporating much of Chairman Genachowski's proposal.  In the U.S. House of Representatives, Congressman Ed Markey (D-MA) has introduced the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009 (H.R. 3458), which would direct FCC to officially adopt and enforce the six principles.  This legislation has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.  Please be assured that I will keep your thoughts in mind should this issue come before the full Senate for consideration.  To keep track of any future actions on this bill, you can go to the ""Bill Tracking"" service at http://lieberman.senate.gov/issues/resources.      

 

Thank you again for sharing your views and concerns with me.  I hope you will continue to visit my website at http://lieberman.senate.gov for updated news about my work on behalf of Connecticut and the nation.  Please contact me if you have any additional questions or comments about our work in Congress.

How many zeros in a billion???  
  
This is too true to be funny.   
The next time you hear a politician use the   
word 'billion' in a casual manner, think about   
whether you want the 'politicians' spending   
YOUR tax money. 

A billion is a difficult number to comprehend, 
but one advertising agency did a good job of   
putting that figure into some perspective in   
one of its releases.   

A.  
A billion seconds ago it was 1959.   

B.  
A billion minutes ago Jesus was alive.   

C.   
A billion hours ago our ancestors were   
living in the Stone Age.   

D.  
A billion days ago no one walked on the earth on two feet.   

E. 
A billion dollars ago was only
8 hours and   20 minutes, 
at the rate our government 
is spending it.   

While this thought is still fresh in our brain...
let's take a look at  New Orleans  . 
It's amazing what you can learn with some simple division.  

Louisiana Senator, 
Mary Landrieu (D) 
is presently asking   Congress   for  
250   BILLION DOLLARS  
to rebuild  New Orleans  . Interesting number..
what does it mean?   

A.  
Well.... if you are one of the 484,674 residents of  New Orleans    
(every man, woman, and child) 
you   each  get  $516,528.   

B.  
Or... if you have one of the 188,251 homes in 
New Orleans  , your home gets  $1,329,787..   

C..  
Or... if you are a family of four... 
your family   gets  $2,066,012.

programming,"Hi Reddit, I'm trying to get my career back to programming. Can you help?","Hello Reddit,

Summary: I used to be a programmer, then made the error of getting two degrees in finance and wandering into banking. I've missed programming ever since, and I'd like to get back in. I'm good with Perl, C, C++, Java, HTML, and SQL, but my experience is a little old and quite varied. See the complete saga below...

The Saga:
Back in the day while in high school, 1992-1996, I taught myself a bit about programming. When I was 18, I got my first gig working for a library software company writing in C. I spent a year in college (what I call my ""first trip through"") being a general yobbo and didn't do to well in the first trip. My brother invited me out to California to help him start up a website. We did a lot of work in Perl, and obviously I know HTML inside and out. I also did a lot in C and C++, including writing an email filtering doohickey that we attached to sendmail to cut down on the rivers of spam our users got every day. We also wrote a popup blocking browser using the IE module in Visual C++.

Anyhoo, I thought I should go finish my degree, so I moved back across the country, got a job as a network admin and programmer with the library software company, and finished a finance degree in 3 years. This time at the library software company, I was managing a Bugzilla server, sendmail, apache, the firewall/NAT, and all things Linux related. I was the only linux nerd there, but most of the infrastructure of our network ran on linux, so I had enormous freedom to configure things as I saw fit. It was awesome. :)

So, I finished my degree in finance, shopped for a job in finance and found the prospects to be pretty grim. It looked like financial sales was the main job I was able to get, and that was an appalling prospect. I decided on grad school and got a master's in finance. Once I got out, I found the prospects to be appalling and I went into financial sales -- mortgage brokerage. After a while, I got promoted and did SQL work for the COO, and used a perl script to automate the posting of interest rates and extraction of data from LendingTree.com sales leads. 

About that time, I met a guy who is a portfolio manager for a hedge fund, and he wanted to start a software company to turn his hedge fund strategy into a piece of client-server software so his trading signals could be transmitted to users for a monthly fee. Long story short, in about 4 months he stole the software and kicked me to the curb. It was written in C#, primarily. During this gig, I also got some experience using TradeStation and eSignal, if you happen to be in the investment management world, you'll know what those are.

So, then I was stuck in a small town on the frontier and I took the best job available: Financial sales. :( I worked for one of the mega investment houses for 2 years, and I was doing so well they flew me out to NYC for an incentive trip... 3 weeks before they croaked in the Crash of '08 and laid me off. Since then, I've worked a few months as a mortgage underwriter to pay the bills.

That brings us to today. I still miss programming because I usually felt I had actually created something at the end of the day when I was working as a programmer. I liked the mental challenge, the detailed work, and the constant updating of skills. I was very good at it, and I have a lot of useful experience if I can find an employer who's willing to take a good look. I would obviously be best suited to programming banking, finance, and real estate related applications since I know that world very well. I have extensive training in statistics, econometrics, regression analysis, time series analysis, you name it. 

So, what do you think, Reddit? Can you help me get my career back from banking and over to programming once again?",technology,2009-10-30,-0.0235087362944827

politics,"If a society is judged on how it treats its poor, we would be at the bottom. - A true story that happened to me two hours before this post.","I made it just before their 2 AM close. It was drizzling as I rolled down my window to speak into the Wendy's drive-through microphone. The cold stung sharply as it rushed into the car. I placed my order and pulled up to the cashier window. I cranked up the heat as I was handed my food. As the cashier was counting my change, he inquired about about a homeless lady that had apparently been pestering people ordering food for money and a ride. ""I spooked her off a bit ago, but them folks always come back,"" he ranted. I grabbed my change and pulled away with my hot meal. As I was driving through an empty supermarket parking lot adjacent to the restaurant, I noticed a black lady running towards my car flailing her arms. It was raining hard now and there wasn't another car in sight. I was about to speed away, but I hesitated as I saw this small boy practically in tow behind her. As she approached the car, I rolled down the window with a slightly annoyed look on my face to hear what she wanted. ""I just need a ride a few miles down the road,"" she said in desperate almost crying voice. She was old, completely drenched, and her boy was shivering in the cold night. ""I guess"", I said. She exhaled with a loud sigh of relief as she buckled up her boy in the back seat of my car. She got in and immediately huddled close to the blasting hot air coming from my air vent. ""Lord bless you,"" she said. 

As we were driving, I noticed her son completely transfixed on my bag of hot food. ""Hey"", I said. ""You can go ahead and have that food."" An expression of sheer joy appeared on the boys face and he hastily grabbed the bag of food. He scarfed down the meal seemingly in an instant as his mother thanked me profusely. I was proud of myself. ""My landlord kicked me out a week ago when the government stopped sending me my disability checks,"" she muttered as we continued down the road. ""I have congenital heart failure, and can't work"". ""Thats awful,"" I said. I inquired as to why the government stopped sending her money, and she said she didn't know. She filled out forms seeking answers, but hadn't yet received a response. I responded with some silly phrase like ""life is full of ups and downs"". She didn't say anything and just lowered her head. The boy chimed in seemingly full of energy now as we pulled up to the destination. ""Don't worry"", the boy said to me in an innocent naive voice. ""Barrack Obama is going to make our problems go away"". I smiled at him and then noticed the mother was brought to tears by her boys words. ""Go get our blankets ready,"" she said to the boy as he jumped out of the car and disappeared into the night behind a building. 

She looked directly at my... tears streaming down her face. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""I need to ask you for money so my boy and I can eat."" ""I can't work and the government just doesn't seem to care,"" she mumbled as she fiddled with an Obama campaign button on her jacket while unsuccessfully holding back her tears. I was heartbroken... I instantly reached for my wallet and pulled out all of my money. To my dismay I only had two dollars in cash. I handed them to her. ""I'm sorry"", I said painfully. ""I wish I had more."" She took the money as she looked out the window to where she had to sleep. She burst into tears and cried for a good solid minute as she kept saying ""I'm scared, I can't, I'm scared, I can't...I just can't do it anymore"". My eyes were watering at this point... I scooped up all the change I had in my car and shoveled it into her pockets. She regained some composure and thanked me for all my help. She took the campaign button off her jacket and said, ""here, take this, I noticed you looking at it earlier."" She placed it in my hand and got out of the car before I could tell her that I already had one. I watched as this old lady with congenital heart failure disappeared behind the building to find her ""son"" that was obviously far too young to be hers. I looked down at the worn Obama campaign pin in my hand. It read ""Hope"". As my car idled motionless, I cried.

This is a true story that happened to me about two hours ago. As of this moment, I am ashamed to be an American. If a society is judged on how it treats its poor, we would be at the bottom. We live in one of the richest countries on the planet... I am ashamed.... We should all be ashamed.",cryptocurrency,2009-10-31,-0.3336759656654945

Here is the response I got today:

****************************

Thank you for contacting me with your thoughts on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 2009 and the right to guarantee employment to individuals regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity. I appreciate hearing your thoughts on such an important issue.

Today, too many individuals within the United States are either losing or are unable to obtain jobs due to their sexual orientations or gender. These Americans simply want to go to work and live quality lives, contributing their talents and energy to our great nation. We are a better nation when everyone here has an opportunity to succeed and the discrimination and fear of termination that they currently face should not be allowed under federal law. 

The Employment Non-Discrimination Act was introduced on August 5th by Senator Jeff Merkely. I am a cosponsor of the bill because I believe that there is great strength in our diversity. Given a fair opportunity at employment, the American people make up the greatest workforce on earth. Together, we can revitalize our economy and once again lead the world. While the legislation has currently been referred to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, rest assured that I will continue to fight to provide all Americans with an equal opportunity for success.

I will continue to listen closely to what you and other Illinoisans have to say about matters before Congress, the concerns of our communities, and the issues facing Illinois and the nation. My job is not about merely supporting or opposing legislation; it is also about bridging the divide that has paralyzed our nation's politics.

It was a relatively casual format with her expounding a bit on her department's responsibilities as well as current challenges faced by the United States. I thought I'd share a few highlights.

1) A student from the Greater Boston area asked what effect legalization of marijuana would have in combating Mexican drug cartels. Note, this question was (naturally) met by great applause and laughter from both the audience and the madam secretary herself. 

Her response, however, was somewhat less jovial and significantly more protected. Her short answer was that legalization would have no impact on the drug trade given that there was a demand side problem as well as a supply side problem. I'm still not sure how this addresses the question since I thought the original implication was that legalization would create a legal market for recreational drugs, which would force the cartels out of the market. Perhaps some Redditors can explain the other side to me?

2) A student from Nebraska (I think) was brazen enough to ask the madam secretary to commit on the spot to equal rights for gay couples. Specifically, he asked whether she would commit to the movement to allow gay couples to bring their spouses across the border, a right long afforded to straight couples. This question was also met with applause, although it should be noted that many members of the audience remained purposefully silent. 

Napolitano's response served to reinforce my impression that the Obama administration is still reluctant to take a hard stance in favor of the gay community. In line with the ""I want everyone to like me"" political maneuver, she essentially dodged the question entirely, neither implying whether she thought it was good or bad that gays did not have equal rights. Specifically, she said that marriage was legally defined and until someone else voted on that she was bureaucratically helpless. After she said this there were a great many disappointed sighs in the audience.

3) The chair asked Janet whether she thought America was safer since 9/11 and the introduction of her department. I scoffed loudly at this question and garnered a few dirty looks. Her answer was something along the lines of ""yes, of course America is safer now!"" She's the head of US Homeland Security, what else is she going to say?

4) A Norwegian student pointedly asked, ""Guantanamo prisoners, what are you going to do with them?"" This prompted the chair to make a joke about Norwegian questions or some sort that I didn't particularly understand. 

Napolitano's response was promising, however, as she plainly stated that President Obama is still committed to the executive order that states Guantanamo will be closed by the end of January. She also stated that many countries had committed to housing said prisoners although she did not state what countries those were.

After the Q&amp;A session the chair gave Janet Napolitano an LSE hat and said, ""unlike the Norwegians we can't give you the Nobel Prize, but we can give you this hat!""

SNOPES SAYS THIS IS TRUE, CHECK IT OUT !!!!!

Now 'all Guns' must be listed



- Personally i don't understand why its a bad thing to have to have register your guns but there you go.

on your next (2010) tax return!

If you have a gun, I hope it isn't registered!

Senate Bill SB-2099 will require us to put on our 2009 1040 federal tax form all guns that you have or own. It will require fingerprints and a tax of $50 per gun. This bill was introduced on Feb.. 24, 2009, by the Omama staff.  BUT . . .  this bill will only become public knowledge 30 days after the new law becomes effective !   This is an amendment to the Internal Revenue Act o f 1986.  This means that the Finance Committee has passed this without the Senate voting on it at all.     Trust Obama? .... you must be kidding!

The full text of the IRS amendment is on the U.S. Senate homepage, U.S. Senate &lt;http://www.senate.gov/&gt; You can find the bill by doing a search by the bill number, SB-2099.  You know who to call; I strongly suggest you do. Please send a copy of this e-mail to every gun owner you know.|

&lt;Text of H.R.45 as Introduced in House: Blair Holt's Firearm Licensing and Record of Sale Act of 2009 - U.S.... OpenCongress &lt;http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h45/text&gt;

Obama's Congress is now starting on the firearms confiscation bill. If it passes, gun owners will become criminals if they don't fully comply.

It has begun. . . .  Whatever Obama's secret Master Plan is....this is just the 'tip of the iceburg!'

Very Important for you to be aware of a new bill HR 45 introduced into the House. This is the Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sale Ac t of 2009.

Even gun shop owners didn't know about this because the government is trying to fly it under the radar as a 'minor' IRS revision, and, as usuual, the 'political' lawmakers did not read this bill befre signing and approving it!

To find out about this - go to any government website and type in HR 45 or Google HR 45 Blair Holt Firearm Licensing &amp; Record of Sales Act of 2009. You will get all the information.

Basically this would make it illegal to own a firearm - any rifle with a clip or ANY pistol unless:

-It is registered -You are fingerprinted -You supply a current Driver's License -You supply your Social Security # -You will submit to a physical &amp; mental evaluation at any time of their choosing -Each update - change or ownership through private or public sale must be reported and costs $25 - Failure to do so you automatically lose the right to own a firearm and are subject up to a year in jail. -There is a child provision clause on page 16 section 305 stating a child-access provision. Gun must be locked and inaccessible to any child under 18. -They would have the right to come and inspect that you are storing your gun safely away from accessibility to children and fine is punishable for up to 5 yrs. in prison.

If you think this is a joke - go to the website and take your pick of many options to read this. It is long and lengthy. But, more and more people are becoming aware of this. Pass the word along. Any hunters in your family pass this along.

This is just a ""termite"" approach to complete confiscation of guns and disarming of our society to the point we have no defense - chip away a little here and there until the goal is accomplished before anyone realizes it.

This is one to act on whether you own a gun or not..

politics,"Here are some important passages in the 2,000 page Heath care legislation.","• Sec. 202 (p. 91-92) of the bill requires you to enroll in a ""qualified plan."" If you get your insurance at work, your employer will have a ""grace period"" to switch you to a ""qualified plan,"" meaning a plan designed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services. If you buy your own insurance, there's no grace period. You'll have to enroll in a qualified plan as soon as any term in your contract changes, such as the co-pay, deductible or benefit.

• Sec. 224 (p. 118) provides that 18 months after the bill becomes law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will decide what a ""qualified plan"" covers and how much you'll be legally required to pay for it. That's like a banker telling you to sign the loan agreement now, then filling in the interest rate and repayment terms 18 months later.

On Nov. 2, the Congressional Budget Office estimated what the plans will likely cost. An individual earning $44,000 before taxes who purchases his own insurance will have to pay a $5,300 premium and an estimated $2,000 in out-of-pocket expenses, for a total of $7,300 a year, which is 17% of his pre-tax income. A family earning $102,100 a year before taxes will have to pay a $15,000 premium plus an estimated $5,300 out-of-pocket, for a $20,300 total, or 20% of its pre-tax income. Individuals and families earning less than these amounts will be eligible for subsidies paid directly to their insurer.

• Sec. 303 (pp. 167-168) makes it clear that, although the ""qualified plan"" is not yet designed, it will be of the ""one size fits all"" variety. The bill claims to offer choice—basic, enhanced and premium levels—but the benefits are the same. Only the co-pays and deductibles differ. You will have to enroll in the same plan, whether the government is paying for it or you and your employer are footing the bill.

• Sec. 59b (pp. 297-299) says that when you file your taxes, you must include proof that you are in a qualified plan. If not, you will be fined thousands of dollars. Illegal immigrants are exempt from this requirement.

• Sec. 412 (p. 272) says that employers must provide a ""qualified plan"" for their employees and pay 72.5% of the cost, and a smaller share of family coverage, or incur an 8% payroll tax. Small businesses, with payrolls from $500,000 to $750,000, are fined less.

Eviscerating Medicare:

In addition to reducing future Medicare funding by an estimated $500 billion, the bill fundamentally changes how Medicare pays doctors and hospitals, permitting the government to dictate treatment decisions.

• Sec. 1302 (pp. 672-692) moves Medicare from a fee-for-service payment system, in which patients choose which doctors to see and doctors are paid for each service they provide, toward what's called a ""medical home.""

The medical home is this decade's version of HMO-restrictions on care. A primary-care provider manages access to costly specialists and diagnostic tests for a flat monthly fee. The bill specifies that patients may have to settle for a nurse practitioner rather than a physician as the primary-care provider. Medical homes begin with demonstration projects, but the HHS secretary is authorized to ""disseminate this approach rapidly on a national basis.""

A December 2008 Congressional Budget Office report noted that ""medical homes"" were likely to resemble the unpopular gatekeepers of 20 years ago if cost control was a priority.

• Sec. 1114 (pp. 391-393) replaces physicians with physician assistants in overseeing care for hospice patients.

• Secs. 1158-1160 (pp. 499-520) initiates programs to reduce payments for patient care to what it costs in the lowest cost regions of the country. This will reduce payments for care (and by implication the standard of care) for hospital patients in higher cost areas such as New York and Florida.

• Sec. 1161 (pp. 520-545) cuts payments to Medicare Advantage plans (used by 20% of seniors). Advantage plans have warned this will result in reductions in optional benefits such as vision and dental care.

• Sec. 1402 (p. 756) says that the results of comparative effectiveness research conducted by the government will be delivered to doctors electronically to guide their use of ""medical items and services.""

Questionable Priorities:

While the bill will slash Medicare funding, it will also direct billions of dollars to numerous inner-city social work and diversity programs with vague standards of accountability.

• Sec. 399V (p. 1422) provides for grants to community ""entities"" with no required qualifications except having ""documented community activity and experience with community healthcare workers"" to ""educate, guide, and provide experiential learning opportunities"" aimed at drug abuse, poor nutrition, smoking and obesity. ""Each community health worker program receiving funds under the grant will provide services in the cultural context most appropriate for the individual served by the program.""

These programs will ""enhance the capacity of individuals to utilize health services and health related social services under Federal, State and local programs by assisting individuals in establishing eligibility . . . and in receiving services and other benefits"" including transportation and translation services.

• Sec. 222 (p. 617) provides reimbursement for culturally and linguistically appropriate services. This program will train health-care workers to inform Medicare beneficiaries of their ""right"" to have an interpreter at all times and with no co-pays for language services.

• Secs. 2521 and 2533 (pp. 1379 and 1437) establishes racial and ethnic preferences in awarding grants for training nurses and creating secondary-school health science programs. For example, grants for nursing schools should ""give preference to programs that provide for improving the diversity of new nurse graduates to reflect changes in the demographics of the patient population."" And secondary-school grants should go to schools ""graduating students from disadvantaged backgrounds including racial and ethnic minorities.""

• Sec. 305 (p. 189) Provides for automatic Medicaid enrollment of newborns who do not otherwise have insurance.

&gt;The first amendment, introduced by anti-abortion Democrats, bans federal funds for abortion services in the public option and in the insurance ""exchange"" the bill would create.

politics,"I wrote to my congressman Jeff Flake (R-AZ) about McCains Net Neutrality bill, here's the response.","Thank you for contacting me about federal regulation of the Internet.
 
A major debate surrounding telecommunications reform centers on whether or not Congressional action is needed to ensure unfettered access to the Internet.  While some believe that specific regulatory guidelines are necessary to protect the marketplace from potential abuses which could threaten Internet neutrality, others contend that existing laws and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) policies are sufficient to deal with potential anti-competitive behavior and that additional regulations would have negative effects on the future development of the Internet.
 
On July 31, 2009, Congressman Edward Markey (D-MA) introduced H.R. 3458, the Internet Freedom Preservation Act of 2009.  This legislation would establish a national policy of nondiscrimination and openness for Internet access offered to the public.  The bill would also require service providers to offer stand-alone Internet options, as well as transparency in regards to the speed and limitations of their services.  The FCC would be tasked with implementing and enforcing this legislation.  H.R. 3458 has been referred to the House Committee on Energy and Commerce.
 
The government must use caution when imposing any new federal mandate on the private sector.  It is important that Congress strike the proper balance between free markets and regulation, and I tend to favor less federal regulation.

politics,"Reddit, tonight my friend is being executed in Virginia.","When I was 12, my sister turned 16. My parents bought her a total Piece of Shit Volvo for $200. The thing hardly ran, but it was built like a tank. My dad had been using a mechanic he knew who worked on Mitsubishi's to maintain our van which had a knack for breaking down at the worst times. He came cheap, did good work, and was definitely in need of the money.

[John Allen Williams](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Allen_Muhammad) ran a shop out of his house, his wife managed the office managerial duties, and John would drive out to locations to fix things. 

This was perfect for us, because my family was just barely making it, and so we all were working jobs all day and couldn't afford to take time off from work to bring our cars in during normal office hours. We also couldn't afford rental replacements while our cars were in the shop. John would come to our house between 6 and 9 and take care of whatever automotive issues we had.

Several times, the Mitsubishi or my sister's crappy Volvo broke down on the side of the road and John drove out to her and fixed her car and made sure she got home safely. We made sure to thank him for it. 

Frequently, when he came out to our house, it was in the middle of his dinner time. As thanks, we invited him inside for a meal with the family. He shared political and religious views with us, as we were all very intellectually active conversationalists and frequently had small debates at the dinner table (both my parents are teachers). 

He would give me sagely advice on how to deal with problems in school or in general life. 

When I turned 16, I bought a car ('89 Taurus) with my paper route money. It was in much better condition than my sister's Volvo had been, but it still needed some work. We hired John out to the dealership to look the car over before we purchased it, to be sure there was nothing wrong. I remember even now, working with John as he showed me how to replace the Distributor Cap, 2 spark plugs, Air Filter and Fuel Filter. While we were out there, he even told me about some time he spent in the Army. 

Shortly after this was the last time I'd see John. He came out to change the oil in my car and my mom's van. This time he brought a younger boy with him. John didn't talk much while he was here, and the boy didn't say anything. All we knew was the boy's name was Lee. 

They changed the oil and left.


The next time we called (a couple months later), no one answered the phone. John's wife wasn't answering, John wasn't answering. We assumed something had happened and he had closed the business. 


The next time I heard about John was my freshman year of college. The nation's capital was in panic as [random sniper killings were occurring all around the area](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beltway_sniper_attacks). 

My dad called me and told me to turn on the news, and there, staring me back in the face, was our car mechanic, John Allen Williams. But now his name was John Muhammad, and under his name it said he had been arrested as the DC Sniper.

I thought for sure it was a mistake.

My dad spoke with the FBI, but they refused to take any statements. When my dad spoke with a friend of John's, he said that John's wife had taken his children away from him, and after that he snapped and then disappeared.

We've watched the trial for several years now. And tonight, John Muhammad is to be executed. Strangely, a federal crime tried in a state court. I'm past the argument, as I'm sure most people don't care or want to care, and I'm sure there's some legal reason how the Federal Government can release it's responsibility to prosecute federal crimes to a state with a death penalty.


All that I care about is that people know that John Muhammad wasn't always an evil man. That I remember not even a decade ago, a John Allen Williams that was a very kind, caring and loving man and father, and an excellent mentor and friend.

Rest in peace, John.

**The Ant and the Grasshopper**


*Monday, November 9, 2009 at 2:29pm*

This is a long one, but stick with it. 

A dear, sweet, gentle relative of mine, who I can't say enough about really, in terms of dearness, sweetness, and gentleness, has developed the habit of sending me ridiculously right-wing email propaganda. She's just the most lovely woman, but a lovely woman who happens to be a gigantor Glenn Beck fan.

I've been receiving and deleting these emails for the past few years, and only recently did I venture to open one. It was of course insane, and I immediately thought, ""How unfair that she gets to send insane emails to me when I'm clearly more insane than she is."" So I decided to reverse propagandize her. It was a laugh for me, and then I realized that others might enjoy it too. 

The emails all deal with far right topics, which I realized pretty quickly cast me in a terribly poor light. I am after all an illiterate immigrant minority in this country, and come to think of it, I even spent a brief period on welfare. I don't have a lot going for me other than my wit, my unarguably great looks, and sex organs that almost prove intelligent design. I'm pretty sure this is all lost my really just tremendously nice relative, but the foot-in-mouthness of it all is fun for me to think about.

So here's her crazy email first, and then my response to it. Enjoy it, damn you!

Hers (which was originally all colorful but, to my shame, can't be recreated here):

THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This one is a little different....
Two Different Versions! ................. 
Two Different Morals!

**OLD VERSION:** 

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.

The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.

Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.

The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself

**MODERN VERSION:**

The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.

The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.

Come winter, the shivering grasshoppercalls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while others are cold andstarving.

CBS, NBC, PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshoppernext to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. America is stunned by the sharp contrast.

How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopperis allowed to suffer so?

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing, 'It's Not Easy Being Green.'

Acorn stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing, 'We shall overcome.'Rev. Jeremiah Wright then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's sake.

Nancy Pelosi &amp;Harry Reid exclaim in an interview with Larry King that the ant has gotten rich off the backof the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share.

Finally, the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity &amp; Anti-Grasshopper Act retroactive to the beginning of the summer.Theant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugsand, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the GovernmentGreen Czar.

The story ends as we see the grasshopper finishing up the last bits of the antsfood while the government house he is in, which just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around him because he doesn't maintain it.

Theant hasdisappeared in the snow.The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident and thehouse, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the once peaceful neighborhood.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Be careful how you vote in 2010.

--

**Mine:**

The ant worked hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.

The grasshopper thought the ant was a fool and laughed and danced and played the summer away. 

The ant then noticed that the grasshopper would need a house come winter, so he offered him a subprime loan, which the ant knew the grasshopper would never be able to repay. The ant kept this knowledge to himself though, and the grasshopper took the shoddy deal. The grasshopper wasn't terribly great at finance because he had skipped college to take care of his younger brothers. His father had run off years before with a White Pine Weevil who turned out to be a prostitute. 

Meanwhile, the ant bundled the subprime loan along with countless others and sold it to another bank. He put half the profits from this transaction into a Ponzi scheme he had created, and he blew the other half on 'white pollen', which is insect slang for cocaine. He did the coke off a transsexual caterpillar, by the way, and then he paid her extra to step on his feelers. 

Back over at the grasshopper's place, things were looking bleak. His variable-rate mortgage just skyrocketed because his financial adviser, the ant, conveniently neglected to include a rate cap. The ant had assured him it would be fine, and the grasshopper took him at his word, foolishly showing faith in basic insect decency.

The financial pressure had long been taking its toll on the grasshopper's marriage as well. His wife was growing colder as their bank account grew smaller, and she hadn't given up any ovipositor in like weeks. One evening their arguing escalated, and in a rage she devoured several of their egg pods, effectively ending their courtship. The grasshopper was despondent.

Several final notices later, the insect police (I don't know, beetles probably) showed up at the grasshopper's door to throw him into debtors' prison, which still exists in insect society. Fittingly, these two cops were both on the ant's payroll and had covered for him several times when he was caught hookworm trafficking. 

The cop beetles threw the grasshopper in jail where he was repeatedly gang-fertilized by spiders. And by spiders, I mean black guys. Or Mexicans. Or whoever we're supposed to hate/be afraid of now. 

The ant, under mounting legal trouble, relocated to a foreign country where the age of consent is much, much lower.

Meanwhile, other ants were completely ethical and even started charities. Grasshoppers worked at these charities. A common housefly became a firefighter. A cricket murdered six people. Several butterflies started a cult. A single louse joined the UN and orchestrated peace in the Middle East. A centipede just kept his day job and drank on the weekend. 

MORAL OF THE STORY: Generalizations about people are typically just masks for racism, classism, or sexism. Negative acts are ubiquitous, just as the positive. The poor are not to be blamed, feared, or demonized, and neither is any other grouping of human beings. Also, be wary of money-hungry ant-Jews.",finance,2009-11-13,-0.2349791606796207

We Can't Sit Back and Allow the Loss of Our Freedoms

by Andrew Napolitano 

FOXNews.com

We elect the government. It works for us. As we watch the Democrats' plans for health care take shape, we can only ask how did our government get so removed, so unbridled, so arrogant that it can tell us how to live our personal lives? 

Last Saturday, at 11 o’clock in the evening, the House of Representatives voted by a five vote margin to have the federal government manage the health care of every American at a cost of $1 trillion dollars over the next ten years. 

For the first time in American history, if this bill becomes law, the Feds will force you to buy insurance you might not want, or may not need, or cannot afford. If you don’t purchase what the government tells you to buy, if you don’t do so when they tell you to do it, and if you don’t buy just what they say is right for you, the government may fine you, prosecute you, and even put you in jail. Freedom of choice and control over your own body will be lost. The privacy of your communications and medical decision making with your physician will be gone. More of your hard earned dollars will be at the disposal of federal bureaucrats.

It was not supposed to be this way. We elect the government. It works for us. How did it get so removed, so unbridled, so arrogant that it can tell us how to live our personal lives? Evil rarely comes upon us all at once, and liberty is rarely lost in one stroke. It happens gradually, over the years and decades and even centuries. A little stretch here, a cave in there, powers are slowly taken from the states and the people and before you know it, we have one big monster government that recognizes no restraint on its ability to tell us how to live. It claims the power to regulate any activity, tax any behavior, and demand conformity to any standard it chooses.

The Founders did not give us a government like the one we have today. The government they gave us was strictly limited in its scope, guaranteed individual liberty, preserved the free market, and on matters that pertain to our private behavior was supposed to leave us alone. 

In the Constitution, the Founders built in checks and balances. If the Congress got out of hand, the states would restrain it. If the states stole liberty or property, the Congress would cure it. If the President tried to become a king, the courts would prevent it.

In the next few weeks, I will be giving a public class on Constitutional Law here on the Fox News Channel, on the Fox Business Network, on Foxnews.com, and on Fox Nation. In anticipation of that, many of you have asked: What can we do now about the loss of freedom? For starters, we can vote the bums out of their cushy federal offices! We can persuade our state governments to defy the Feds in areas like health care -- where the Constitution gives the Feds zero authority. We can petition our state legislatures to threaten to amend the Constitution to abolish the income tax, return the selection of U.S. senators to state legislatures and nullify all the laws the Congress has written that are not based in the Constitution.

One thing we can’t do is just sit back and take it.

politics,I contacted both of my senator's demanding net neutrality and received long-winded emails full of lies declaring their intention to do no such thing.,"Letter #1
&gt;Dear Mr. and Mrs. Frostbite7217:
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for contacting me about Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and their ability to manage Internet traffic. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this matter. 
&gt;
&gt;In recent years, America's dependence on the Internet to facilitate our personal and professional communication has dramatically increased. Though technological advancements have occurred, boosts in consumer demand for Internet services and multimedia digital content have resulted in congestion along the broadband network. Consequently, there is pressure on ISPs to efficiently manage network traffic in order to ensure that data is delivered in a reliable and timely fashion. 
&gt;
&gt;Although existing Federal Communications Commission (FCC) rules grant ISPs broad network management abilities, FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski recently indicated his interest in adopting regulations that could limit this authority. I understand your concern about the lack of statutory Internet principles; however, I am concerned about the unintended effects of such regulatory intervention in an industry characterized by rapid transformation. Technological change occurs quickly and often in ways that regulators cannot imagine. A top-down regulatory approach could unnecessarily constrain an industry’s ability to create and deliver new products and services to market. Such efforts would delay the investment in broadband access across the country and would be inconsistent with the maintenance of a free and open source of communication and expression that is vital to the survival of our democratic republic. For this reason, I oppose any regulation promulgated by the FCC that would inhibit the growth and development of the Internet.
&gt;
&gt;I appreciate having the opportunity to represent the interests of Texans in the United States Senate, and you may be certain that I will keep your views in mind should the Senate consider relevant legislation during the 111th Congress. Thank you for taking the time to contact me.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;
&gt;JOHN CORNYN
&gt;United States Senator

Letter #2
&gt;Dear Friend:
&gt;
&gt;Thank you for contacting me regarding equal and unrestricted access to the Internet. I welcome your thoughts and comments on this issue.
&gt;
&gt;The Internet is a valuable tool that facilitates business, education, and recreation for millions of Americans. In 2008, an estimated 220 million Americans had access to the Internet at home or work. As Ranking Member of the Senate Commerce Committee, I am committed to ensuring that consumers benefit from competition in the telecommunications industry, resulting in lower prices, improved service, and access to 21st century technology.
&gt;
&gt;Instrumental to the success of the Internet is the longstanding policy of keeping the Internet as free as possible from burdensome regulations. Increased investment in upgrading and expanding America’s Internet infrastructure, as well as innovative new broadband networks, will ensure that all Americans have access to affordable high-speed Internet. However, intensified regulation of the Internet, such as congressionally mandated treatment of data, would stifle competition and would decrease the incentive for network operators to invest in the Internet infrastructure. 
&gt;
&gt;It is my concern that mandates that prevent network providers from managing congestion on the Internet will reduce service speeds for many users, and eliminate a valuable tool for ensuring the most efficient use of network pipelines, resulting in increased costs to the consumer. In a June 2007 report on the issue of “network neutrality”, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) stated that no “demonstrated consumer harm from conduct by broadband providers” had occurred due to network providers managing Internet traffic. More recently, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a decision involving Comcast and certain network management practices. While this decision works its way through the courts, Congress may continue reviewing network practices and Internet congestion issues.
&gt;
&gt;Should any legislation regarding Internet access come before the Senate Commerce Committee, you may be assured I will keep your views in mind. I appreciate hearing from you, and I hope that you will not hesitate to keep in touch on any issue of concern to you.
&gt;
&gt;Sincerely,
&gt;Kay Bailey Hutchison
&gt;United States Senator

Edit1:
I have replied to both of the letters with this statement.
&gt;It is statements like this that confuse the general population about the what the actual issue of net neutrality is.  As a computer programmer, it is an issue I hold close and directly affects my career.  It seems that you would side with the corporations instead of with the people on this issue.  The internet must remain open, and free of corporate shaping for profit.  Due to your stance on the issue, I will have to support your challengers in future elections.  I will be encouraging my friends and family to do the same.
&gt;
&gt;Thank you,
&gt;Frostbite7217

The History of Haiti's Debt","Haiti: “Don’t Hate Me!”

Civil Wars. Natural Disasters. Military Dictators. Coups d’etat. Counter Coups. Corrupt Politicians. Violent Occupiers. Violent Revolutions.  Slavery. Economic Slavery. Along the path of development, Haiti has faced more obstacles than most countries… and it shows. In 2008, Haiti placed 148th on the HDI and 202nd in GDP per capita, making it the poorest country in the western hemisphere.  Key to its economic troubles, as of September 2008, Haiti had amassed $1.5 billion in external debt, equal to 29% of its GDP.  Furthermore, Haiti’s debt service as a percentage of export earnings amounted to 26.2%.  Since its inception as a political independent country, Haiti’s consistently dire economic situation has stemmed from unreasonable amounts of debt imposed on it by western powers. 
From 1492 until 1804, France and Spain ruled Haiti with oppressive governments characterized by extractive economic policies. Soon after Columbus’ “discovery” of the New World, Spain established a colony on the island of Hispaniola, the western portion of which makes up modern Haiti. Following the decimation of the native population, Spain imported African slaves to work tobacco fields.  Throughout the 17th century, French settlers began to establish vast plantations on western Hispaniola and continued to use slave labor. Having grown weary of Spanish attempts at ruling them, by 1697, the French plantation owners living on Hispaniola petitioned the French government to annex the western third of the island. After fighting a war with the Spanish, the French did just that. Haiti soon earned the nickname “the pearl of the Antilles” for it became the richest colony in the western hemisphere and one of France’s most profitable colonies in its entire Empire.  Plantation owners grew indigo, coffee, and sugar, the most lucrative crop, for exclusive export to France. Furthermore, by the end of the 18th century, Haiti “was supplying two-thirds of all of Europe’s tropical produce.”  Slavery created Haiti’s wealth, and the colonial government enacted a series of laws on the regulation of slave labor that made Haiti “one of the most brutally efficient slave colonies there has ever been.”  By the last decade of the 1700s, however, unrest among the slave population began to grow, and eventually swelled to a full-blown slave revolt in 1804. The Haitian Revolution resulted in the successful defeat of French forces, making Haiti the world’s only nation born of a slave revolt, the first colony in the western hemisphere to gain independence, and the worlds first black republic.  Newfound political freedom, however, did not mean the end of European manipulation of Haiti. 
Since independence, developed nations have saddled Haiti with debt that has severely limited its ability to grow economically and contributed to widespread poverty. Haiti’s debt began when, after throwing off French colonial control, Charles X of France threatened to invade Haiti, reinstitute slavery, and return it to his empire. In exchange for peace, France demanded a payment of 185 million francs (equivalent, with interest, to $21 billion today) as compensation for stolen property, mostly slaves.  Desperate for international recognition and unwilling to fight another war, the Haitian government agreed to the payment and received a loan from a French bank.   This new country now had a massive new debt equal to fourteen times its annual export earnings.  This meant “Haiti was forced to send any available cash to France, diverting revenues from investments in infrastructure, education and government services.”  As a result, Haiti has consistently ranked towards the bottom in literacy rates, life expectancy, and poverty prevalence. Haiti has been unable to educate its own citizens and lacks the skilled workers needed to compete internationally. Haiti was unable to fully payback this original debt until 1945, well after it had already fallen miserably behind in development.  	
Although Haiti has paid back its original debt to the French, it continues to hold a large debt stemming from the actions of previous dictatorships.  In 1957, the Duvalier family came to power in Haiti and ruled as dictators until 1986.   The US, along with the IMF and World Bank, supported this autocratic regime with military and economic aid in order to check against Cuban influence in the Caribbean. Haiti was a poor nation and political leaders in Washington feared that a communist revolution could take place. Francois Duvalier, the “President for Life” of Haiti during the 1960s, played on the fears of the American political establishment in order to secure international monetary assistance. Duvalier, his son, and the rest of the family diverted this money intended for development and spent it funding militias suppressing communists and any other form of political dissent.  They placed money directly into personal bank accounts. In one instance, Francois Duvalier traveled to New York and spent $20,000 in a single shopping spree.  Of Haiti’s current $1.4 billion in external debt, 45% was accumulated under Duvalier leadership.  
Since the 1990s, Haiti’s creditors have agreed to eventually cancel all of Haiti’s debt provided they meet certain political and economic goals. Most of Haiti’s debt is in the hands of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with the rest owed to the IMF, World Bank, and the US government.  Taking the lead on this issue, the group known as the “Washington Consensus”  has agreed to debt relief upon three conditions: a dramatic reduction is the size of the civil service, the opening up of Haitian markets to free trade, and the cutting by half of import tariffs for rice and corn.  Furthermore, the Washington Consensus has made debt relief conditional upon free and fair elections. Ironically, however, France and the US have been actively funding insurgent groups and cutting off aid when socialist candidates have come to power.  
Much of the popular support for these socialist candidates has come from Haitians marginalized by their government’s recent liberalization of its trade relations. Acting upon the recommendation of the Washington Consensus, Haiti dropped its tariffs on key imports and adopted export oriented industrialization in an effort to increase the flow of foreign investment into Haiti.  For farmers, who comprise 50% of the population, this spelled disaster.  Cheap agriculture products from America, federally subsidized and produced with corporate efficiency, flooded domestic markets, drove down agricultural wages, and forced farmers to default on their farms.  As a result, Haiti now must import 50% of its food.  In order to make Haiti an appealing place for investors, the government has established tax-free free-trade zones with loose restrictions on the movement of capital.  Many Haitians have sought work in factories in these zones, which provide a stable, though low wage. In an ideal situation, both investor and worker can benefit from this economic activity. As a result, the manufacturing of apparel has now become Haiti’s chief export.  Despite these measures, in 2005, Haiti ran a trade deficit of $1.1 billion.  As money continues to flow out of the country, Haiti’s debt becomes more debilitating. The government is unable to invest in its own economy or citizens, and the full repayment of that debt becomes increasingly unlikely and unpractical. 
	With complete debt relief a reality within the next 5-10 years, signs of Haiti’s budding development have surfaced, though not without setbacks. Haiti’s GDP has grown consistently since 2004, with a 2.8% annual growth rate in 2008.  In addition, with the cancellation of its foreign debt, the government Haiti can begin to invest more into its people’s education and health, two keys to long-term growth. On a negative note, despite an increasing GDP, GDP per capita has not risen at the same rate.  Some economists attribute this to the “growing pains” of economic liberalization and forecast robust GDP per capita growth in the future.  Haiti has also experienced devastating hurricanes, the most brutal one in 2004, which have cost the country $900 million, or 14.6% of GDP.  Certainly this country does not have it easy. Whatever the future may hold for Haiti, one hopes that a country nominally free, but economically enslaved, for the past 200 years may finally be able to control their own destiny and provide a life for its people worthy of dignity and respect. Maybe its about time Haiti’s bad luck ran out.

gaming,I don't understand the craze behind CoDMW2,"So I recently got an Xbox360.  I got the WF2 bundle because of the bigger HDD and an extra controller.  After getting on XBL and downloading about 50 demos and trials I decided to try out MF2.  Granted, I was **never** a big fan of FPS--  I found them to be kind of boring, however, I did play Battlefield, BF2, TF2, HL, HL2, and MaxPayne (is that an FPS? i don't remember) and found them to be quite enjoyable.

So, I start the game and...wtf? Ok, the ""tutorial"" is pretty cool.  Ok...some guy just briefed me on some mission, eventhough I have no idea what he said, and the visuals (satellite image zooming in and out) doesn't explain much either...Oh ok, I just appeared in the middle of some operation as...wait...who am I??? Who am I playing as?? 

whatever....ok....shooting...shooting...shoosting again. get in the car, oh cool I get to control the gun.  Oh yay it's a rail shooter! etc... Mission over. k??? I don't get it.

Satellite images zooming in and out again with some old guy briefing me on my next mission talking way too fast.  I have no idea what he was saying...*FLASH* wtf?? snow? mountains? HUH??  Wow this is pretty cool, but wtf am I doing here?


and so it goes on...You get the idea.  So besieds a few ""cool moments"", I have no idea what i'm doing, why i'm shoosting people, or who I am.  Is it supposed to be like this?  Am I missing something?  Is it just me?

I understand the multiplayer accounts for more than half of the game, but is it really the only reason why its selling like hotcakes?

Please fill me in...


**TL:DR:** I don't understand why MF2 is so freaking revolutioary and amazing.  SP is confusing me and I don't get it.  Is MP the only reason why it's beloved?  Please explain



**edit: why the downvotes?  I am not trying to bash the game in any way.  In fact, I WANT to understand and like it.  Also,  I haven't touched Multiplayer yet because I want to finish SP first, and I AM looking forward to MP because the perks, achievements, rank ups, etc, sound very interesting and fun.**

So we decided to all abstain until yesterday and LAN L4D2 on expert. We managed to go from about 7pm until 3am, and finally finished Dead Center after having dropped down to Advanced I think after screwing up stage 3 way too many times.

I'm guessing it could be something as simple as bringing the wrong tactics from the previous game, but is anybody feeling that all of a sudden, just being good enough to scrape through Expert is a huge ask?

Does anybody have any tactics (short of going to Delta Force school) that have a ""oooh right why didn't I think of that"" factor that makes L4D2 Expert feel a little less like trying to walk through a brick wall?

I think my biggest qualm with having to drop to Advanced is that FF is no longer something to care so much about. I'm sure it'll clear up a ton of arguments, but it just feels like cheating!

I've also noticed, the special infected are much more dangerous, and mini hordes seem to come almost ALL THE TIME. This combined with zombies buffed now that arm shots aren't so effective, I can see why we have to pay attention so much. Thankfully the Tank and Witch have been nerfed (gives up on incapped players and chainsaw respectively). Their nerfing has lowered the difficulty at a few small focussed points in the campaign, but across the majority, the difficulty is raised. I guess this makes sense in comparising to L4D though, most of the difficulty in that really was saved up for just making sure you've got the right gear and HP for the Tank, and hoping it's in an area where you can light him up and run away. 

Overall, L4D2 is a much better and more balanced game I think, but my ego is taking a hammering in the difficulty raise, or my inability to separate this game from L4D tactics :)",technology,2009-11-22,-0.010520711384405

On the other hand, in an interview with [DemocracyNow!](http://www.democracynow.org/2009/11/20/students), Bob Samuels makes the case that this is a clash of ideas: should state universities be run for public good or on a for-profit model?  He also gives a lot of interesting tidbits, like:

* Only 20% of the UC budget comes from the state, so slashing it by 20% only decreases the overall budget by 4%.

* the UC's have received a lot of funds from the federal stimulus, and a record funds in grants and through their medical facilities

* The administration has swelled by an obscene amount over the past decade, and they are getting bonuses, even while they are firing teachers and raising tuition

* The intercollegiate athletics have been losing money, and have been subsidized through student fees to the tune of 5 million.

So his point is, there are plenty of places to cut that wouldn't affect the undergraduate education.

Economics,What is the Economic argument for Manufacturing in the UK/US?,"Hi,

I was wondering if somebody could explain the economic argument for the manufacturing revival in the UK/US.

I do not understand why this sector is needed for a healthy balanced economy. Surely the sectors which have the most value added for the least amount of input in comparison with the rest of the world would be the most desirable sector to have in a economy that is open to trade. In advanced economies such as the UK this is financial services. It would be unsustainable for the UK to be totally dependent on financial services if the economy was closed, in fact it would be a impossibility. However, in an open economy it would be sustainable to be dependent on one sector so long as the policy which determines the viability of the sector is sound. In this case monetary policy was not sound and that led to the collapse of the financial sector. Conversely one could argue that if it were not for loose monetary policy the financial sector would not have boomed in the way that it did and the economy sectors would be much more diversified. 

Anyways looks like I am having a conversation with my self, what are your thoughts?

Throughout my life, I have been stifled by my apparent lack of creativity and have had countless opportunities to create websites and developments that I've in the end, thrown in the toilet due to the fact that I can't seem to come up with anything revolutionary or even the smallest bit innovative.
    
    
    
I feel like a copy pasta developer sometimes. I can see the solution to a problem, do it, and it will fix that problem. As if I copied and pasted the solution out of my head, without any creativity and as if it's been done before. I feel my solutions lack creativity and could have been done better.
 
 
 
I'm at my limit, and as my job is progressing and getting deeper into itself I find myself falling into a deep cavern as the solutions get harder and I am unable to think of new ideas to fix these problems.
 
 
 
I have the willingness and drive to do more, but can't envision it.

It's worth remembering that Obama's election was part of an overwhelming rejection of the Republican Party that has taken place since 2006. People were fed up with Bush's wars, Republican racist scapegoating, and blatant favoritism of the rich. The Democrats for the first time in generations were handed control of both houses of Congress and the White House. They had a mandate to reverse all those policies, and easily had the ability to do so--if they wanted to.

The fact that they have not should leave us with only one conclusion: the Democrats are actually not fundamentally different from the Republicans. At best, there are minor differences around the edges. But when 64 members of their party enable the biggest attack on women's reproductive rights in decades -- one of the few issues which we're always told separates them from the Republicans -- it's time to face the music: the problem is not actually Republican obstructionism. It's the Democrats themselves.

science,The reluctant AGW skeptic,"I am an anthropogenic global warming (AGW) skeptic.  My opponents call me a 'denier,' which is funny for reasons I'll explain later.  I would rather not be a skeptic, but I feel compelled to take a stand because of how this issue has evolved.  Please allow me to explain.

I have no love for oil companies (or coal companies, for that matter).  They are poor corporate citizens and continually worm and weasel their way out of responsibility for their own atrocities.  (The much maligned Sarah Palin actually took on Exxon in Alaska, but reddit it too partisan to care.)  In the past, when conversations turned to climate change, I would often keep my opinions to myself simply because I would kind of like to see certain [Giant Monsters](http://cluborlov.blogspot.com/2009/11/giant-monsters.html) get their comeuppance.  ""Why should I care,"" I thought, ""if I am being fed a line?""  But it did bother me, from an intellectually honest point of view.

Here is something I wrote nearly two years ago (with minor editing) that explained my thoughts at that time:

&gt;If you choose to believe me, then you are about to read an opinion from someone who is truly undecided on the issue of anthropogenic climate change. I have studied both sides of the argument whenever I can (which is too rare, I'll admit), and I am still undecided. Here are some of the reasons why: 

&gt; - There are more scientists on the ""global warming is true"" side, but there are legitimate scientists on the ""global warming is false"" side too

&gt; - For every piece of of good scientific evidence discussed, there are a hundred ad hominem or political attacks

&gt; - Making predictions is hard, especially about the future (oblig. Yogi Berra quote)

&gt; - Autodidacts such as myself are better swayed by good, reasoned argument than by credentials

&gt; - When discussing change versus the status quo in energy production and usage, we are talking about tremendous amounts of money, and hence power. It is nearly impossible in such an environment to have a reasonable discussion without the influence of those with an agenda. 


&gt;I, personally, doubt very much that real scientists have ulterior motives. However, non-scientists seem to be less bulletproof. For example, it is very hard for me to take Al Gore seriously because he is the chairman of a [company](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_Investment_Management) that stands to make a killing if laws are changed to reduce carbon emissions.


&gt;On the other hand, I have no love for the oil companies. The Forbes top 20 list of large companies is roughly split between financial companies (Chase, Citigroup, etc.) and oil companies. And Microsoft. They are a force to be reckoned with, and I admire those brave enough to say to them, ""You are the problem."" The past practices of many of the oil companies are deplorable, and I would feel little pity for them if they were to go bankrupt.


&gt;Add to this my belief that many of our (I'm American, so define ""our"" accordingly) problems with other nations stem from the unfathomable wealth these nations have accumulated from oil and how they have distributed that wealth. Enough has been said of this in other places that I won't elaborate here.


&gt;These two factors together are enough for me to feel inclined to stay out of the climate change debate. The inertia favors those who say it is real and want policies to reduce oil consumption. Of course, that does not make me a believer, and there is one factor that makes me hesitate: my concern for the poor.


&gt;I advocate policies that do not harm the poor. You might say I'm a progressive, but please don't call me a democrat (or republican for that matter). I have seen oil companies employ, at very good wages, those that would have no other course out of poverty. I also believe that measures that would reduce carbon emissions would drive up energy costs (domestic use and transportation) and that would affect most those with the least.

Since then, my opinions have changed a little.  The growing suspicion I had that the deck was being stacked against skeptics was confirmed in a glorious fashion with the recent ""climategate"" emails.  I still feel that there is no reasonable discussion of the science involved.  It is just namecalling and propaganda, even on reddit for the most part.

In fact, it was a few rude redditors that helped me finally decide to take a stand.  Had those supporting the view that CO2 is the primary cause of recent warming and that it causes a real threat to Earth's ecosystem been less conceited, kinder, and more rational in their discussions, I doubt I would have even become involved.  To me, it was a clue that they didn't have much to back them up.  In law, it is said that if a lawyer has the facts on his side, he will pound the facts.  If not, he will pound the law.  If he has neither, he will pound the table.  There is a lot of table pounding going on around here.  I guess it should come as no surprise.  They are following the bad example set by the loudest climate scientists.

I have expressed in other posts my concern over the dishonesty found in the IPCC reports, specifically the disappearance of the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice age from one report to the next.  I have observed efforts to make these things appear to be smaller in magnitude than they actually were, and even to make them appear regional in scope, not global.  All of this to make it seem that current warming will be cataclysmic.

If I could go back in time to 1997, I would urge the IPCC to take a different tack.  I would tell them to not mess around with climate history, and instead say, ""It looks like we are on a natural upswing again, much like the Medieval Warm Period.  But we will likely overshoot it because of increased CO2, and the results could be really bad.""  They could have said this because it is true.  Instead, they dicked around with the climate record and now they have lost credibility.  Should nothing real come out of Copenhagen, you can thank Mann, Jones, and the rest of the party posse for this.

The poetic justice here should be pointed out.  People may call me a denier, but I am a skeptic in large part because there were so many deniers of another sort: Medieval Warm Period deniers.

So in the end, it is these factors, plus my alarm at the flippancy and/or ignorance activists have towards the poor and how policy decisions that come out of their activism will affect the less fortunate, that cause me to feel compelled to join these discussions.  It is well known that there is a major difference of opinion about AGW between the left and the right.  The left are often the True Believers.  The sad thing was that the left were the only ones who gave a damn about the poor.  Now they have chosen to step on them in their zealotry.

If ever there was a time for a 'tl;dr' it is now, so here goes.

**tl;dr:** I am a skeptic because of overly zealous activists and the conceit among certain climate scientists who have been caught in lies, half-truths, and manipulations, and because of the effect climate change legislation will have on the poor.",technology,2009-12-01,-0.2925172564478525

If you compare the history of the Detroit Lions football team with the US automakers, you will see an important correlation.  The last time the Lions were a decent franchise was in the 50’s and early 60’s, also a golden age for US automobile manufacturers.  They had a brief respite from their sad state in the early 1980’s, neatly coinciding with Lee Iacocca’s work at Chrysler.  They had a brief shining moment in the 1990’s during the Barry Sanders, Minivan, SUV era, but this was short lived.  Last year the Lions were 0-16 along with 2 of the big 3 requiring federal bailouts.  I know some of you may say that correlation is not causation, but I think you all are missing the point.

politics,"We don't need Democrats, we don't need Republicans. We need Progressives and we need leaders.","So, my buddy wrote an essay and I omitted some rage-inducing things, but his thoughts are all well thought out, in my opinion.


Simply put, our system is broken. In today’s world, the educated and uneducated alike see that as a truism. What takes a more trained eye to see is why our system is broken. While I was sitting in history today, my professor was lecturing about the end of the Cold War, and how the best leaders are ones who take risks. That also is a truism. That, however, got me thinking: Where are the risk-takers in our government today? The simple answer is that there are none. Our country’s leaders are so obsessed with power, and afraid to take unpopular action that might jeopardize their reelection that our country has stagnated. Our federal government no longer is a government of liberals and conservatives, but one of centrist neo-cons and neo-libs who are virtually indistinguishable in their actions. 


Ideally, liberal ideology runs along the lines of big government, high taxes, and high spending. Conservatives ideally take the opposite position on each of those. Each is fiscally viable and any rational person can see the merits in each. However, high taxes, despite their merits, are unpopular, and program cuts, despite their occasional necessity, are as well. This wouldn’t be a problem if we had a one party system, because we’d have a consistent system of one or the other. This, however, is not and should not be the case in America. The reality is, we have a cyclical system of party politics. We bounce back and forth between Democratic and Republican administrations, and during each campaign each party touts the best part of its traditional platform. The Democrats promote programs and the Republicans promote tax cuts. With each of these, however, should come the parts that are unpopular as well, those being tax hikes and program cuts. However, for the sake of political popularity, each side has ignored these facets of their respective platforms, and with each successive change of power, starting with the Kennedy administration, we get more programs and bureaucratic expansion with Democrats and are increasingly unable to pay because of the ever-popular tax cuts and (since Reagan) military spending that Republicans give us. With each passing administration, each party is forced to move closer and closer to the center and instead of conservatives and liberals, we now have neo-cons and neo-libs who no longer care about practicality or political viability as long as whatever they do gets votes. Then, when the public seems to wise up to one party the other espouses its traditional platform as a solution. Then, once in power, they do the exact same thing that they’ve always done. The end result is what we have today: Our national debt has spiraled out of control and is estimated to be as much as 90% of our GDP by the end of the year. 


A good case study here would be the last decade. The Clinton years oversaw, arguably, the best economic decade in history, and as a result, he left office with a surplus in the federal budget. The Bush administration then immediately saw the worst economic collapse in decades in the dot-bomb, and rationally enacted some of the most massive tax cuts in American history. How the cuts were distributed is beside the point. This would normally be perfectly acceptable, given the situation, but the administration turned right around and dumped money into defense spending for a war we had no business fighting, which led to the budget spiraling out of control and to the eventual downfall of the inept Bush administration. Given Bush’s widespread unpopularity, it wouldn’t have mattered if Obama, Hillary, or George McGovern was running for the Democrats; they had the election won by 2006. Therefore, we should have expected the incoming “liberal” administration to scale back the Bush tax cuts, rein in the military, and return us to a state of fiscal responsibility. The conditions, that would have made these actions possible didn't exist, however, because of events that were beyond the control of both parties. The economic collapse was the fault of the SEC and other oversight organizations for letting the financial sector of the economy become as corrupt as it is. However, Obama wouldn’t have run on a platform of increasing taxes anyway, because that would be politically unpopular. The tax increases and the congruent program expansion that would have accompanied them were therefore impossible. The government was forced instead to spend $789 billion that it didn't have on programs and tax cuts and the result has been the projected $1.84 trillion 2009 budget deficit, and with the healthcare bill pending it could be more, but this is neither the time nor place to argue about that. Anyway, the next administration, whether it be Democratic or Republican, already has its hands tied because, unless we have a bold and strong new President, they won’t increase taxes or cut spending for fear of becoming unpopular. 


This problem is big, but at the same time, is not insurmountable. There are solutions, but it’ll require the right people to get it done. Throughout history, the best Presidents have been those that have expanded the power of the executive. Lincoln, during the Civil War, expanded Presidential power arguably more than any other president in history, and is revered as one of the greatest of all time as well. Theodore Roosevelt believed in a strong executive, actively pressured Congress to push his agenda, and is also remembered as one of the best leaders we’ve had. FDR, while the merits of the New Deal are debatable, more or less abused his executive power, yet is still looked upon as one of the best Presidents we’ve ever had. Finally, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger, opened China to us, did more to thaw the Cold War than any administration, and virtually ended, although messily, the Vietnam War because they believed that in order to get stuff done, you need a strong executive. Granted, Nixon took it too far and let paranoia get the better of him and is not remembered as one of the best Presidents of all time because of his involvement in Watergate. All of these men were wildly popular (Lincoln won 3 elections, Teddy won 1 and would have won a second if Taft would have backed down, FDR won 4, and Nixon won 2 and beat George McGovern in 49 out of 50 states) and they all believed in a strong executive. I’m not arguing for a dictatorship, I firmly believe that representative democracy, although it is sluggish, is the best form of government when human nature is a factor. I also don’t think we should give the President more constitutional power, because centralizing power in the hands of one person is always a bad idea. What I am saying, is that we need a President that isn’t afraid to assert their power, one who isn’t afraid to step up and take an unpopular stand to do what is right. A good example here would be LBJ and the Civil Rights Bill. He spent all of his political capital to push the legislation through, knowing full well that it would cost him the South to do so, and the result was one of the most important pieces of legislation in American history. We don’t necessarily need an idealist in power; we just need a leader who is willing to make changes at the expense of his career.

politics,Anyone tired of all this Obama-bashing? It's like everyone who supported him with vague statements about unrealistic hopes is now criticizing him with vague statements about unrealistic hopes.,"There is plenty to be excited about with Obama's first few months:

-He has set an end date for the War in Afghanistan

-He's signaled the end to the era of foreign policy antagonism towards China.

-He negotiated with the top developing economies on climate change (instead of pointing the finger of blame at China and India like previous administrations), and as a result is going to Copenhagen with concrete, if slightly lower than hoped, emissions cuts. 

-His stimulus bill did give more money to Wall Street, but it also put money towards rebuilding our infrastructure, researching promising green technology, expand our broadband network, better fund special education programs, to name a few.

-Yes, he's said he's against legalizing marijuana federally, but has told the Justice Department to stop prosecuting individuals who are in compliance with their state's marijuana laws.

-He's decided to close Guantanamo Bay.

-He employed an actual, thoughtful decision making process leading up to his West Point Speech on Afghanistan. He didn't just wing it, guns blazing like some other presidents I know.",technology,2009-12-06,-0.038693814893159

politics,Proposal for the formation of a new political party,"The current two party system in the United States has thus far proven it's inability to look to the interests of the common working american. The lack of protective tariffs for american industry, the lack of effective farm subsidies for the farmers of America, the overwhelming pandering to corporate interests for the sake of lobbyist funds is unconscionable. America has allowed itself to become a third world nation over night. Our industrial capacity is gutted, our natural resources raped and pillaged, our citizens beholden to the whims of careless insurance conglomerates as to whether or not they deserve to live. 

This is unacceptable! The working people of these United States deserve a voice in their government that is untainted by the pull of filthy money to forsake their constituents votes. The market is no longer free but run by those select few who have both the funds and means to suppress our votes. Our media does not report the truth but what the wealthy few want us to hear. American's are no longer provided facts but spoon fed their opinions by talking heads. 

The wealthy privileged few run our nation while we the masses are expected to feed their machine for wars and subsidies. Our taxes pay salaries to careless dolts who disregard our pleas for healthcare and equality, while giving away jobs and material for shortsighted views on temporary fiscal gains without looking to long term social and fiscal responsibility.

The biggest plight to the average american is not over bearing taxation, but fiscal irresponsibility on the select few who are deemed ""Too big to fail"". It is the absence of social services, adequate care and wages that is destroying America not some amorphous moral plight.

Too long America's politics has been divided on whether a woman has the right to decide on carrying a child, whom has the right to marry whom, forsaking the genuine issues that are destroying this great nation and leeching it's life blood. Large wealthy entities are seizing American assets for short term political gain, and our elected bodies are more than content to sign away our fleeting assets and abilities for more cash to seek re-election!

We the people need to divorce ourselves from the notion there are only two sides to the argument and address the genuinely pressing issues. Not Gun control, but hunger control! Gay marriage and caring for our sick and elderly! Not abortion, but educating those children who are entering the job market woefully underprepared to compete with our international peers! Not who won the latest American Idol contest, but keeping the one media outlet that Americans can moderate; the internet, free! Not the war on terror, but the war on the workers!

Obviously, our political system is beyond broken.

Here is my list:

1) Bring back the WPA and order them to lay fiber to the home across the entire US, build the smart grid, repair our roads/bridges, and build maglev trains between all major cities.

2) Replace all coal and natural gas plants with liquid fluoride thorium reactors. Build so many of these that we finally achieve the ""too cheap to meter"" promise of nuclear power. This, plus my next point would reduce our carbon emissions to almost zero.

3) Create a crash program to get off of oil (especially foreign oil). Throw ridiculous amounts of money into battery and ultracapacitor research for electric cars. Also legalize industrial hemp production and use it to make bio-diesel and throw lots of money into algae-based bio-diesel. Create a funded mandate that all cars sold in 2020 must at least be serial-hybrid with bio-diesel generators and preferably pure electrics.

4) Start an enormous research program for fusion power with the goal of having a practical reactor in 10 years.

5) Start an enormous research program for geo-engineering (bio-fuel carbon capture and storage, carbon scrubbers, algae seeding, etc.) to reduce the effects of global warming as much as possible.

6) Shift a significant portion of the military budget towards pure scientific research, in particular biotechnology and nanotechnology. In the end, the NSF and DoE budgets should be comparable to the DoD budget.

7) Enact single payer health care.

8) Create a basic income/flexicurity system (probably based on Milton Friedman's proposed negative income tax system with some idea's drawn from Denmark's flexicurity). This is meant to eliminate poverty completely and protect people from a future in which robots and AI take most of the unskilled labor jobs.

9) Bring back and modernize Glass-Steagall for financial regulations.

10) End the drug war completely (legalize possession and sale, regulate like beer or cigarettes).

11) Mandate that all universities that receive any federal funding must place all course materials online for free (including textbooks and videos of all lectures). This will open up university quality education to anyone that wants it for free and should create downward pressure on college costs.

12) Reform copyright laws to be more sane. Not sure exactly what we will end up with, but life + 90 years or whatever it is now is ridiculous.

That is all I have for now. Before anyone says ""this is too much spending that can't afford!"", please re-read the list and see that most of the major points are investments in technology that will create massive amounts of economic growth to pay for everything. Also, I would strongly argue that each one of the points I cited would actually save lots of money in the long run.

politics,"Republicans are right.  No, wait, hear me out...","I'm a politically unaffiliated independent that grew up in a liberal household, and through my own musings I've come to the conclusion that one thing that Republicans have right is that government is not the ideal solution (""government is not the answer!"").  I think that's partially why there has been such a draw in the past towards support for Republican candidates.

I think, when it comes down to the realities, the primary ideological difference between the two parties (when it comes to government) is that Republicans believe government is inherently corrupt and that the ""free market"" is a better solution, while Democrats seem to believe that government has some role to play in circumscribing private enterprise.

What Republicans seem to neglect, however, is that many modern societies are founded upon a form of governance where those in power are beholden to the will of the people; if they become negligent of their duties to serve the greater public will, they get the boot.  Though it should be noted that it's good to keep a government's powers in check so that they don't have the opportunity to have a sort of mutiny (wrong word, I know) against the public.

Personally, what I find very frustrating is that, on the Democratic side, people tend to ignore the reality that government isn't the ultimate solution; grassroots individual/communal changes would certainly be preferable to a government mandate (e.g. you're for universal health care?  Great!  Then go out and become a doctor who tends to the poor and stop bitching about how there are 50 million still uninsured).  While, on the Republican side, there seems to be an ignorance to the reality that if you abolish government entirely, you have anarchy.  The only caveat here is that there may be Republicans who are in favor of relinquishing federal powers to the states.  They seem to be in the minority. Though, that doesn't seem to come across through all the Republican criticisms of government.

So, yeah, via this post I'm essentially hoping people will come to recognize that the difference between a Republican and a Democrat--in this respect--really just comes down to that ideological difference in perspectives: that one believes government is superior to, while the other believes government is inferior to, an unrestricted economy.  I don't think there's a lack of knowledge out there; there's just a lack of education.

Economics,How is it legal to increase credit card interest retroactively?,"Hi guys this is my first post here!

I'm no financial expert, but it seems like if you agree to a credit card company's interest rate, and run a balance at that interest rate, that balance should be locked in at the initial interest rate.  

Now if you make a late payment and they raise your rate (like straight from 14% to 29.99% in my case), then first and foremost they should have to notify you of the increase.  Second, all purchases made after that rate increase date should be applicable at the 29.99%, but everything before the rate increase date should still accrue balance at the initial interest.  

My reasoning here is that every purchase is like a mini-contract or agreement with the company to pay back the cost of the item plus interest.  So why should they get to decide down the road that you have to pay over twice as much interest?  That wasn't the agreement.

And the ""cardholder's agreement"" is so purposefully daunting that I don't think it holds much sway in this argument.  If in the fine print of a software user agreement it said that the software could corrupt your files as it saw fit I think a judge might throw out the agreement.

gaming,"Hey /r/gaming, looking for a new game.  Can I tap your expertise?","I know there have been a million similar threads, but I always seem to find new suggestions.

I'm into open-world, RPG, strategic, and/or procedurally generated games.  I'm not much of a ""twitch"" gamer.   If I had to list favorites, I would likely go with (in rough order):

Planescape Torment

Morrowind

Dwarf Fortress

X-Com (the original)

Star Control II

Baldur's Gate Series

Freespace 2

I also cannot stand old 3d or quasi-3d graphics; for example, I would likely have a hard time going back and playing Morrowwind now - and I unfortunately totally missed (and cannot get into) Daggerfall now.  However, I have no issue with 2d graphics (Avernum, Starcraft, etc).

I have a PC, and it can -barely- run modern games, so the newest stuff out there is unlikely to work for me.

What life-destroying gems have you found?

Economics,Would anyone care to criticize an analysis of mine? (about gold speculation),"A friend of mine thinking about buying gold maintains that the dollar, if not on the verge of collapse, will certainly depreciate; therefore, investing in gold will protect the value of his assets. He claims that inflation will be caused by having the Chinese finance our rescue packages and by drastically increasing the money supply. What follows is my response; please identify any bullshit or incorrect statements, and feel free to disagree.

----

A weak dollar would basically destroy China as we're their main export market. This is why China isn't dumping their reserves to swamp the dollar and become the dominant currency; they're still very much subordinated by the unfortunate system of lending the US money so the US can buy Chinese exports.

As long as China's rural-agricultural sector remains underdeveloped it will continue to depend on the vitality of the coastal region for employment, prolonging the stagnation of migrant workers' wages, thus making impossible any significant increase in domestic consumption. So until China gets its internal imbalance between rural and coastal wealth fixed (which isn't likely given the political situation there now), its domestic consumption will remain low and it will continue to rely on the ability of the US to absorb its exports, i.e. its own economic well-being depends on a strong dollar.

By increasing the money supply, the Fed only eases the pain of capital's restructuring: once capital shakes off its bad assets and finds new avenues of growth the Fed will probably tighten (possibly accelerated by an anti-deficit populism), thereby halting latent inflationary trends. Given the government's efforts towards job-creation and its desperate attempts to stimulate consumption, which is helped along by a strong consumerist zeitgeist within the middle and working classes that acts as a damper on falling consumption, things don't look so bad for the dollar considering how China mostly underwrites these policies and the social milieu comes free.

So what would seem like capitalists' ignorance of inflation is actually the opposite: By using its control of cable media to elevate the perceived value of gold to its current price, the bourgeoisie accumulates the remaining assets of the working classes through dispossession. (Much of the working class' financialized assets had already been lost after the markets collapsed.) And notice how they've especially targeted the retired working class, on which a previously strong labor movement conferred good pensions and benefits (which allowed it to accrue sizable savings that were mostly unfinancialized, shielding those assets from the market's caprice), but whose economic literacy is weak and whose social ambivalences are strong, thereby making it an easily exploitable bunch (A black man as president?! rabblerabblerabble!). The capitalists aren't ignorant of the risk of inflation. They're more concerned with the extent to which gold is currently overpriced and with finding ways to unload it.

While the US ""is committed to a strong dollar,"" as Obama said before his trip to Asia, the commodity traders are stirring up a demotic hysteria with disinformational programs to convince people otherwise. The gold bubble will burst.",finance,2009-12-13,-0.0457954874245295

Economics,"Rosenberg makes some very strong and interesting points - [excerpt from ""Breakfast with Dave"" 12/14/2009]","For those of you who may be intersted, this is the strongest, as far as I remember, I have ever seen Rosenberg get with the current administration and ""victim"" mindset that seems to permeate the media.  I was struck by his tone in this section so just thought it may spur some interesting discussion.

While this is an excerpt from this 12/14/09 talking points I don't think extracting this section takes too much out of context.  What I should add is his comments were in response to the President Obama's Weekly Address pointing the finger at the banks instead of also pointing out the complicity of policymakers.  Enjoy!

""...as a long-time reader of our research and valued friend told us over the weekend, “he [Obama] finally threw the banks under the bus”. While not suggesting the adjectives are undeserved, I am afraid that the U.S. President has invited all consumer borrowers, creditworthy or not, to abdicate their financial responsibility. We now have borrowers as victims.” Ain’t it the truth. And the consequences will be profound. Our friend reminded us that in regard to our theme of “frugality”, the current reality is that “frugal” represents just the first wave in a fundamental change in behaviour towards complete self-interest and risks morphing into something a little more troubling, such as abdication of individual responsibility. 

Meanwhile, the adjective used to describe the banks and their actions, were, in a word, scary (and if you want more on ‘scary’, read the WSJ assessment on Obama’s appearance on the television show 60 Minutes yesterday — talk about being completely out of control and inciting divisiveness — see Obama’s Slams ‘Fat Cat’ Bankers). This backlash against the banks, whose behaviour was condoned by the government when the credit and housing bubble was in full swing, is surreal. 

As we said, the media has no problem in running articles that complain about the lack of credit being extended by the evil banks, even though it was excess debt taken on by a profligate consumer that got us into this mess to begin with. The front page of the Sunday NYT runs with Rates Are Low, But Banks Balk at Refinancing. Basically, 60% of mortgage borrowers carry interest rates that are above the current market cost, but refinancings are still down 57% from year-ago levels because the banks have battened down the hatches on their lending guidelines; “The plight of homeowners has become a volatile political issue”, according to the NYT. Well, that’s probably not the case for the 30 million Americans who own a home with no debt or the countless others who have a mortgage but also know how to live within their means. The article says “the banks that once handed out home loans freely are imposing such restrictions that many homeowners who might want to refinance are effectively locked out.” So, because the banks lent freely in the recent past, and this excess was at the root of today’s problems, then the banks should go back to those days of reckless lending behaviour. 

Come again? Nowhere in the article is there any reason provided as to why the banks are “stricter” — maybe it has something to do with the amount of equity the borrower has in his/her house, or what his/her credit-rating has been cut to, among others. The way the media and politicians are portraying the situation is that it is every citizen’s god-given right to have credit. This is amazing. We aren’t exactly recommending a return to Calvin or Kant puritanical behaviour, but what we are seeing unfold right now is very disturbing. 

We continue to stress that everyone read that front page article from Thursday’s WSJ, which was absolutely disgusting — titled American Dream 2: Default on Mortgage, Then Rent. The word “and Spend” should have been in the title too — consumers are no longer paying their mortgage and using the funds for other things like trips to amusement parks. This is now seen as being a totally cool and appropriate thing to do — stop paying your mortgage and go have fun. 

It’s the lender who will end up being screwed, but nobody cares about that faceless bank, right? The tone of the article, and this is the Wall Street Journal we’re talking about, sent chills down my spine — no concern at all about the growing ability and willingness of consumers to walk away from their financial obligations. And certainly no remorse by those quoted in the article who have defaulted and left somebody else holding the bag. It may very well be this “tacit approval” of such irresponsible behaviour that will end up crippling banks’ ability and willingness to extend credit in the future, because we have news for the President: being public companies, the lenders’ fiduciary responsibility first and foremost is to their shareholders, not deadbeat debtors.""",finance,2009-12-15,-0.2003035272114052

politics,It is time for the Senate Liberals to Play Dirty,"After Lieberman's game of claiming he will support the health care bill if a particular change is made and then refusing to support the bill after the change is made, it is clear we are not dealing with a person negotiating in good faith. The same goes for the Republicans, who will oppose any bill that has the potential to make Obama look like a strong leader. The opponents of health care have reduced the negotiations to a petty and childish game. Therefore, there is no reason for liberals to maintain the pretense of good faith efforts to work with the opposition.

At this point, the Senate liberals need to unite and play dirty if they want to get anything accomplished. I suggest they do one of the following three things:

1) Tell the Republicans and Lieberman if they want to filibuster, then they have to do it the old fashioned way by talking, not with a procedural filibuster and a cloture vote. Make them talk until they collapse and then pass the bill.

2) Strip the bill to Lieberman's liking and pass it, making him think he won a victory. Then, the very next day introduce all of the provisions removed from the bill (including a strong public option) and pass it with reconciliation.

3) Nuke the filibuster and pass the bill they want. Also, then pass a financial regulations bill and the climate bill.

At this point, I'm leaning towards number 3. The ability of a single man to essentially shut down the legislative process is demonstrating that the filibuster usage is going too far. In recent years, the Senate has broken records for the number of cloture votes simply because of obstructionism by the Republicans after the Democrats retook Congress in 2006. Therefore, at a minimum, a strong legitimate threat to remove the filibuster (like what Frist did in 2005 over the federal judge confirmation) would likely get a few Senators to give in and vote for the cloture to protect themselves from future liberal legislation.

Also, If Harry Reid refuses to go along with one of these strategies, then he should immediately be replaced as Senate Majority leader with either Dick Durbin or Chuck Schumer, who are the next in line. Harry Reid has proven himself to be a very poor leader. He has many cards he could play, but has refused to use any of them. This is probably the most important bill for the Democrats since the 1960s and he has utterly failed to do his job.

Also, under no circumstances should Joe Lieberman be allowed to remain the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee and all of his other committee seniority. Additionally, the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee should immediately announce that they are seeking a candidate for the 2012 Connecticut Democratic Senate primary. Finally, a large financial reward should be put out by rich liberals (e.g. Larry Flint or George Soros) for anyone with evidence of wrongdoing by Lieberman, which can hopefully then be used to impeach him so we can have a special election to replace him in a few months.

politics,"I emailed my Senator, Chris Bond, of Missouri about health care reform.  Here is his response:","Thank you for contacting my office regarding health care reform. I appreciate your taking the time to share your views with me on this very important issue.

I have heard from folks across Missouri faced with rising premiums and higher health care costs, as well as hospitals, doctors and other health care providers struggling with the rising costs of treating the uninsured, and I agree that we need reform. To achieve real reform, Republicans and Democrats must work together on solutions that lower the cost of health care, increase access for all Americans, improve the quality of patient care, and address the unfunded liabilities of Medicare and Medicaid.

Unfortunately, Democrats in Washington want to pass legislation that would vastly expand the role of government in health care. After being written behind closed doors for six weeks, Sen. Reid’s health care bill was finally revealed to the Senate and the American people. Unfortunately, all Sen. Reid had to offer was 2,074 pages of federal bureaucracy that will cost more than $2 trillion over ten years once fully implemented and will increase health care costs, raise taxes and cut Medicare for seniors. This bill will also force Americans into a government run health care plan, ration care, and limit access to life-saving treatments, and put a bureaucrat between you and your doctor.

The Reid bill includes gimmicks to hide from Americans the true costs of their bill, including a great stunt to push back spending on major parts of reform until 2014 but start raising taxes and cutting Medicare immediately. This allows Sen. Reid to hide the true cost of the bill by collecting money up front to pay for the countless new and very expensive programs and services later. Claiming “savings” of $130 billion by recording taxes over 10 years and only scoring costs over 6 years would get a private business man in jail.

This is not the kind of reform the American people want from Congress. We do not need a costly government overhaul of health care to give the American people what they want. There are several bipartisan reforms that can make a difference right now and bring down the cost of health care for Missourians. I am still hopeful we can work together on real reform that will lower costs, increase access, and improve patient care.

We can pass common-sense reforms now, such as helping small businesses find affordable health insurance options for their employees, providing tax equity for people who buy health insurance on their own so they receive the same tax benefits as those who get insurance through their employers, eliminating junk lawsuits so doctors can stop practicing defensive medicine, encouraging wellness, prevention and disease management programs that improve lives and reduce costs. Also, we need to enroll low-income Americans in the health care programs they are already eligible for and reform Medicare and Medicaid to prevent these safety-net programs from going bankrupt. We must crack down on waste and fraud that drive up the costs of health care. We can do this without costly government mandates or higher taxes that will destroy jobs during a time of economic recession.

What we need is for Democrats to stop ignoring the American people and start working with Republicans on real reforms that can make a difference right now. Reform that will lower costs, increase access, and improve patient care. That is a health care agenda that can be truly bipartisan.

Again, thank you for your letter. Please do not hesitate to contact my office again if I can be of further of assistance.

Sincerely,


Christopher S. Bond

I want to point out something that really does trouble me about what is happening, the way that the wealth of this nation is being accelerated upward. That’s one of the problems that I had with the bailout.  You could say that it helped stabilize the American economy, but what I see is the separation between the real economy and Wall Street. Wall Street is stabilizing, markets are a lot better, banks are doing well - they parked their money at the Fed for a while so they could get higher interest rates.

All across this country people are starved for capital, small businesses are failing, you have shopping centers that are becoming vacant because people can’t afford the rents anymore because the people who own the malls, the developers, are getting cash calls and credit is tightening. 

We are in a deep recession that has not yet bottomed out, despite the statistical correction in the November statistics.  This separation between the finance economy and the real economy is real. This is not some fake idea. You can’t call that class warfare. That’s a fact.

The class warfare is over, we lost.  I want to make that announcement today. Working people lost.  The middle class lost.  Don’t tell me about class warfare. Come to my neighborhoods in Cleveland.

We live in an age of advanced technology, where folks here in Georgia can be connected to folks across the world simply by logging on to the Internet.  However, with this incredible access comes increased security risks.  Many people have P2P software on their personal computers for file sharing, and they’re unaware that when they connect to these networks their personal files on their computer are available to anyone else on the network.  Folks are posting their passwords, tax returns, personal messages, and financial records — and they don’t even know it.

P2P software has been implicated in several recent, high-profile security breaches.  In one case, documents detailing the President’s helicopter, Marine One, were found on a computer in Iran.  In another, a congressional aide inadvertently leaked a confidential document about investigations into several members of Congress.  In each case, P2P software was found to have been the culprit.

That’s why I introduced H.R. 1319, the Informed P2P User Act, with my colleagues, Congresswoman Bono Mack (CA-45) and Congressman Joe Barton (TX-6).  The bill, which passed the House on December 8, addresses the security risk of P2P file sharing networks by making users aware of these risks before they log on.

Specifically, the Informed P2P User Act:

Ensures that P2P file sharing programs cannot be installed without providing clear notice and obtaining informed consent of the authorized computer user.
Makes it unlawful to prevent the authorized user of a computer from:
Blocking the installation of a peer-to-peer file sharing program, or
Disabling or removing any peer-to-peer file sharing program.
Gives enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).
I hope the Senate moves quickly to pass the Informed P2P User Act.  The security risks associated with P2P file sharing aren't just a concern for folks worried about their personal files -- it's become an issue of national security.  I hope folks will also take a few moments to speak with your kids about using P2P file sharing programs.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to call my office toll free at 1-866-890-6236, or feel free to visit my website, www.barrow.house.gov.

Obama Raced Clock, Confusion, for Climate Deal - NYTimes.com

Filed at 5:02 p.m. ET

WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was almost unthinkable. The president of the United States walked into a meeting of fellow world leaders and there wasn't a chair for him, a sure sign he was not expected, maybe not even wanted.

Barack Obama didn't pause, however. ''I'm going to sit by my friend Lula,'' he said, moving toward Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.

Aides quickly procured a chair, and Obama spent the next 80 minutes helping craft new requirements for disclosing efforts to fight global warming by the five nations represented in the room. Along with India, South Africa and Brazil, the key member was China, which recently surpassed the U.S. as the world's top emitter of heat-trapping gasses.

At the table this time for China was Premier Wen Jiabao, not an underling as before. Obama was bent on striking a deal before flying home to snowbound Washington.

He would later hail the achievement as a breakthrough. But even Obama said there was much more to do, and climate authorities called Copenhagen's results a modest step in the global bid to curb heat-trapping gasses that threaten to melt glaciers and flood coastlines.

Obama's 15-hour, seat-of-the-pants dash through Copenhagen was marked by determination, confusion and semi-comedy. Constrained by partisan politics at home, and quarrels between rich and poor nations abroad, he was determined to come home with a victory, no matter how imperfect.

Experts and activists may debate its significance for years. Some, like Jeremy Symons, who watched the talks for the National Wildlife Federation, said it was ''high drama and true grit on the part of the president that delivered the deal.''

Others were far less kind. The Copenhagen agreements are ''merely the repackaging of old and toothless promises,'' said Asher Miller, executive director of the Post Carbon Institute.

Even though a weary, bleary-eyed Obama had added six hours to his planned nine-hour visit, he was back in Washington by the time delegates at the 193-nation summit approved the U.S.-brokered compromises on Saturday. The agreements will give billions of dollars in climate aid to poor nations but do not require the world's major polluters to make deeper cuts in their greenhouse gas emissions.

This account of Obama's hectic day is based on dozens of interviews and statements by key players from numerous countries.

------

Obama was thrown off schedule almost from the moment he landed Friday morning in Copenhagen, where the summit's final-day talks seemed to be collapsing.

Instead of attending a scheduled meeting with Denmark's prime minister, he plunged into an emergency session of about 20 nations, big and small, wealthy and poor. Right away there was a troubling sign.

China was the only nation to send a second-tier official: vice foreign minister He Yafei instead of Premier Wen, who was in the building. The snub baffled and annoyed delegates.

For months, Obama had been pressing China to put into writing its promises to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Obama seemed unusually animated when he alluded indirectly to China in a short, late-morning speech to the full conference.

''I don't know how you have an international agreement where we all are not sharing information and ensuring that we are meeting our commitments,'' he said. ''That doesn't make sense.''

Things then appeared to turn for the better, as Obama and Wen met privately, as scheduled, for 55 minutes. A U.S. official said they took a step forward as they discussed emissions targets, financing and transparency.

The two leaders directed aides to work on mutual language, and Obama's team proposed specific wording meant to solidify China's promise to be more forthcoming about its anti-pollution efforts.

A short time later, however, the U.S. team was more baffled and irked than before. At a follow-up session of the morning's big meeting, the Chinese sent an even lower-ranking envoy in Wen's place.

An irritated Obama told his staff, ''I don't want to mess around with this anymore, I want to just talk with Premier Wen,'' according to a senior administration official who spoke on background to discuss sensitive diplomatic issues.

------

By now night had fallen, and it was clear Obama would be late getting home. He kept an appointment to discuss arms control with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Meanwhile he asked aides to try to set up a final one-on-one meeting with Wen, and a separate meeting with leaders of India, Brazil and South Africa, hoping these fast-growing nations which had been loosely aligned with China on many of the key issues might influence the Chinese.

Confusion reigned. Chinese officials said Wen was at his hotel and his staff was at the airport. The same was said of top Indian officials, but nothing was clear.

South African President Jacob Zuma agreed to meet with Obama, then canceled when he heard the Indian leader was away, and Brazil would attend only if India did.

The Chinese said Wen could meet with Obama at 6:15 p.m., then changed it to 7 p.m. Obama used the time to talk strategy with the leaders of France, Germany and Great Britain.

Meanwhile, a four-nation negotiating team known as BASIC gathered. The modified acronym reflected its members: Brazil, South Africa, India and China.

Obama was unaware, however, thinking he was going to meet alone with Wen. After some confusion about who had access to the room, White House aides told the president that Wen was inside with the leaders of the three other countries, apparently working on strategy.

''Good,'' Obama said as he walked through the door. ''Mr. Premier, are you ready to see me?'' he called out. ''Are you ready?'' Inside he found startled leaders and no chair to sit in.

U.S. officials denied that Obama crashed the party, saying he simply showed up for his 7 p.m. meeting with Wen and found the others there.

Whatever the meeting's original purpose, Obama used it to help strike a five-nation agreement on ways to verify each other's reductions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases, a good U.S. ending to their talks with the Chinese.

------

Other agreements that came from Copenhagen were a mixed bag, with some environmentalists keenly disappointed, and probably no nation entirely pleased.

Rich countries vowed to provide $30 billion in emergency climate aid to poor nations in the next three years, and set a goal of eventually channeling $100 billion a year to them by 2020.

The summit's final document said carbon emissions should be reduced enough to keep the increase in average global temperatures below 2 degrees C (3.6 degrees F) since preindustrial times. But average temperatures already have risen 0.7 degrees C (1.3 degrees F) since then.

The nations most vulnerable to climate change, including low-lying islands, say the 2 degree C figure is already too high.

It was just after 1 a.m. EST Saturday when Air Force One landed outside Washington on the flight from Copenhagen. With a steady snow falling, Obama headed for the White House. It would be 3 1/2 more hours before the 193 nations, with a few objections, would agree to the deal brokered by the American president. A short time later the conference adjourned.

Later Saturday, Obama put the best face possible on the results.

''This breakthrough lays the foundation for international action in the years to come,'' he said from the White House Diplomatic Reception Room.

But he got no plaudits in the Chinese press.

The English-language China Daily newspaper called Obama's Copenhagen speech ''grandstanding,'' and said it left non-governmental organizations at the summit disappointed.

[Atul Gawande in the New Yorker](http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/12/14/091214fa_fact_gawande?currentPage=all) writes:

&gt; The bill tests, for instance, a number of ways that federal insurers could pay for care. Medicare and Medicaid currently pay clinicians the same amount regardless of results. But there is a pilot program to increase payments for doctors who deliver high-quality care at lower cost, while reducing payments for those who deliver low-quality care at higher cost. There's a program that would pay bonuses to hospitals that improve patient results after heart failure, pneumonia, and surgery. There's a program that would impose financial penalties on institutions with high rates of infections transmitted by health-care workers. Still another would test a system of penalties and rewards scaled to the quality of home health and rehabilitation care.

Economics,Are we sure micro credit is a good thing?,"Consider this scenario:

A representative of a foreign bank that offers micro credit enters a poor village where the people still live like they have for many hundreds of years. They hold goats and farm their land and sell the food that they produce to each other. (Such a village you might encounter in India, Bangladesh, Africa or South America)

The bank representative offers them loans. The loans have a 30% interest rate, which is high but that's not the issue. I'll get at the issue in a moment. 

So the people get their loans. They work their lands with newly purchased tools and got themselves some new goats and cows. Things seem great. The village seems to prosper. However, as time progresses the amount of trade starts to drop and it keeps dropping. Nobody in the village quite understands how this is possible since everyone got a cash injection due to the micro credit loans they got.

Now here's my theory behind that. 

**Step 1.**
At the very moment that the bank representative entered the village there was a certain amount of money in the village that accommodated for the trade in the village.
The money in the village was at a 100 base points so to say.

**Step 2.**
The bank representative gives out loans to the villagers and the money supply in the village rises. Trade increases as more money as a medium of exchange is available. The money supply in the village is higher now than a 100 base points due to the newly injected money.

**Step 3.**
The villagers work, trade and start paying off their loans plus the interest. The money supply starts decreasing back to a 100 base points.

**Step 4.**
All the loans plus interest have been paid back. The money supply in the village now has sunk below a 100 base points, because the villagers had to pay back more money than they loaned, due to the interest.

**Step 5.**
The village now has less money to exchange goods and services than they had before. In fact the bank that offered them the micro credit siphoned off money from their village's money supply and left them with less money than they had before the bank representative entered the village. The village now has less money that can function as a medium of exchange to trade their goods and services.
The village is worse off than it was before.

Now lets analyze the above scenario. That scenario does in fact exist, however not every scenario is like that, because not every village like in the example above is isolated from the economic traffic of the rest of the country wherein it resides. To put it simply. If only a few merchants in the village ventured out into another village or even a city, then they could potentially bring in more money into the village than is lost by the village due to the interest payments.

Except that is if said merchants succeed. This poses the following problem to the village. If the merchants of their village fail to bring in more money into their own village by trading in other villages, then the aforementioned village will become poorer due to the siphoned off interest.

Now here's where it gets interesting. The village in the above scenario is not the only village that got a visit from a micro credit bank representative. In reality nearly all the villages around the village from the scenario get a visit from a micro credit representative. So every village gets its money supply siphoned off. 

This now poses a problem to the merchants, because every village now has the same problem their village has, namely a lower money supply. Not only has the trade now decreased _within_ the villages, but the trade _between_ villages is now suffering too from the shortage of money as a medium of exchange for trade.

One could however think of scenarios where the micro credit would leave the people better off, but not every village has the variables needed to make it succeed. Not every village has a big city in walking distance so that merchants can sell their goods or services there in order to create an influx of new money into their village. And even on a bigger scale the cities suffer from the same problem. And the cities can only rely on the commercial banks to create loans and the government lending more from the country's central bank.

The point I'm getting at is that micro credit might not be the savior that everyone thinks it to be if one looks at the numbers and mathematics behind it. The above examples at least show a range of scenarios where micro credit hurts the poor.

Even with the low interest rates of Kiva the village(s) from the scenario could suffer from their money supply being siphoned off by the interest.

Now I might be missing variables here that actually make micro credit work, but to be honest I'd like to hear them, because however you twist or turn it the money supply is siphoned off.

Lots of people praise micro credit and promote it. What I'm asking here is. What about the numbers? What about the mathematics behind it? Can those who promote micro credit mathematically prove that it leaves poor people better off?",finance,2009-12-22,-0.2078167158799028

Economics,Dropping the Bomb on Health Care,"As business owners undergo the yearly ritual of passing through eye-popping health insurance premium increases to their employees, it's easy to understand why any attempt at health insurance reform would be met with some degree of hope. Unfortunately, President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress are about to take a very bad system and make it unimaginably worse. 

While ramming their new legislation through Congress, the Democrats have taken great pains to point out that they do not intend to ""socialize medicine."" But make no mistake, that's where we're headed. Even if some naïve centrists believe that their efforts have denied the Left a total victory, the practical implications of the current legislation sow the seeds for complete capitulation. 

This first round of reform could be labeled as the 'neutron bomb' of the insurance industry: it leaves some of the private apparatus standing, but it irradiates whatever remains of the industry's market viability.

The bill's centerpiece is a clause prohibiting insurers from denying coverage based on a pre-existing medical condition. However noble and marketable an idea, this proscription removes the very basis upon which any insurance model operates profitably.

A system of insurance requires that premiums be collected from a pool of low-risk people so that funds are available in case a high-risk event befalls a particular person. In that way, premiums can be low and coverage can be widely available, even if the benefits offered are hypothetically unlimited. 

For example, homeowners buy fire insurance even though their houses are very unlikely to burn down. Recognizing that a fire could wipe them out financially, most homeowners endure the cost of coverage even if they never expect to collect. The same model applies to health insurance in a free market.

However, the health care bill removes the need for healthy individuals to carry insurance. Knowing that they could always find coverage if it were eventually needed, people would simply forgo paying expensive premiums while they are healthy, and then sign on when they need it. But insurance companies cannot survive if all of their policyholders are filing claims!

Correctly anticipating this incentive, the Senate bill imposes an annual fine which gradually escalates to $750 for those who fail to buy coverage. So what? I would gladly pay $750 in order to avoid the $8,000 per year I pay now for personal health insurance. Currently, I'm relatively healthy for a 46 year old and I don't anticipate making a big claim. But if I do, under the new rules I can always get 'insurance' after the fact. Heck, if I can stay healthy for the next couple of decades, I'll save a fortune. Think about how much easier the decision would be if I were 20 years younger! Since most people are capable of figuring this out, the entire insurance industry would collapse under such a system. 

There can be no question that $750 annual maximum penalty is a mere placeholder. It is the camel's nose under the tent. When the non-discrimination provision kicks in, the only way these companies could remain solvent would be for Congress to raise the fine to the point where the penalty is greater than the gain of skipping coverage. 

For me, that would have to be roughly $8,000 per year. Introducing such a fine right now would have surely killed the bill. So, the wily wonks in Washington have chosen to move slower, knowing that once the first step is taken, the second becomes inevitable.

However, there is another, more devious possibility. Perhaps our elected officials actually intend to bite the hands that feed them. They could double-cross insurance companies by not raising the fine in five years, thereby forcing the industry into bankruptcy as millions of healthy people opt-out. During the ensuing 'insurance crisis,' our courageous leaders could ride to the rescue with a nationalized, single-payer system.

The real tragedy is that the current bill does nothing to restrain the forces that are propelling healthcare costs into the stratosphere, namely: regulatory bans of insurance competition, the out-of-control medical malpractice industry, federal programs and subsidies, and a tax code that favors a third-party payment system - which alienates the patient from the cost of his care. 

To consider that many in Washington have the nerve to market this multi-trillion dollar monstrosity as a ""deficit reduction bill"" is to realize that our representatives have lost all touch with reality. For those keeping score, the government made similarly rosy projections in the mid-1960's when Medicare was first introduced. The inflation-adjusted cost of that program already exceeds the original estimate by a factor of ten. That's probably where we are headed this time around.",finance,2009-12-23,-0.1397268887864769

Highlights for the lazy (actual quotes from the article):


* Under the compromise developed by a group of conservative and liberal Democrats, the Senate legislation would no longer include a new government-run insurance program, or ""public option,"" for Americans who do not get coverage through their employers. Instead, the government would essentially contract with a **nonprofit insurer** to provide a nationwide plan that would serve as the public option, according to officials briefed on the discussions.

* The **government would oversee the nonprofit plan**, ensuring that it met basic standards for quality and affordability.

* The compromise would also create a **mechanism for triggering** the creation of a more traditional government-run plan like the one now in the bill, if the nonprofit option does not materialize.

3. The American Nurses Association

Rome wasn't built in a day. This is a big step forward for the US healthcare system. So let's try to appreciate the progress made thus far. Wishing for single-payer healthcare in the current political climate is equivalent to building castles in the air.

For those of you who I have heard say ""better nothing than this weak watered-down bill"", remember the people in risk of dying this year from denied-insurance due to pre-existing conditions.

business,"Reuters: ""New legislation may have a much more dire effect on credit card lenders' earnings"" Actual conf. call: Legislation was blamed for a 2.4% decline off their highest yield ever.","This is all based on Discover's latest earnings.

[Reuters article](http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE5BN2I620091224)

In perhaps the most serious sign of what is ahead for credit card lenders, Discover Financial Services reported that the yield on its loans for the three months ended Nov 30, a measure of the profitability of its assets, **fell by more than half a percentage point from the prior quarter. The credit card company cited new legislation as a major reason for the decline.**

...

The legislation in question, known as the CARD act, was signed into law in May. Some of its provisions -- for example, requiring credit card issuers to give customers at least three weeks, instead of 15 days, to pay their bills -- went into effect in August.

Another round of changes in February will likely be much harsher for credit card companies. Lenders will not be able to raise interest rates on existing credit card balances unless the account is at least 60 days past due, and they will not be able to charge fees for customers spending more than their limit, unless cardholders agree to the fees.

*The consumer protections of the CARD act all sound great to me, although the tone of the article is that this is going to screw over credit card companies big time.  I notice that the .5% decline was not put into context of their overall yield.  I look up the conference call transcript.*

[Relevant part of Discover Financial Services Conference call transcript](http://seekingalpha.com/article/178725-discover-financial-services-f4q09-qtr-end-11-30-09-earnings-call-transcript?source=bnet&amp;page=2)

Net interest margin for the segment which includes cards, student loans and personal loans was 9.37%, down 53 basis points from the third quarter which was the high water mark for margin thus far.

*The half a percentage point is correct, but interestingly what wasn't mentioned was that the previous quarter was their highest yield ever.  I am assuming that's what ""high water mark for margin thus far"" means.  That's certainly what high water mark means for me.  Even better, they break down that .52% decline.*

This decline reflects a number of factors including about 15 basis points related to having a higher proportion of student and personal loans which have lower yields than credit cards, 14 basis points from a combination of running higher liquidity pool along with a higher cost of funds reflecting our recent debt transactions.

In terms of the yield on the card portfolio itself we reported a decline of 24 basis points sequentially largely attributable to the absence of the fall repricing as we began to implement changes required by the Card Act.

*Of the .52% decline, they blame only .24% on the CARD act.  Their previous quarter yield would have been .52% higher, so 9.37% + .53% = 9.90%.  .24% into 9.90% is a 2.4% decline.  As far as I see it, they're blaming the legislation for a 2.4% decline from their highest yield ever.  Ever.  I found 'dire' to be an odd choice of words by Reuters once you look at the numbers.  Especially considering that high water mark yield number came in the current economic situation.*
