politics,My New Year's Resolution for Boomers:  STFU &amp; Listen For Once - You Failed.,"I am sick and tired of Baby Boomers judging  those of us that followed after them.  I am done with Boomers insisting they have the right to lay down anymore ""wisdom"" upon us.

I think I will scream if I hear another Boomer insist that my generation is immature and irresponsible because we watch cartoons like Family Guy and get some of our news from the Daily Show.  I may possibly dump a load of oral diarrhea on the next Boomer that says Generation X is lazy because we unwind with video games or surfing the web.  

I really do not care nor will I explain to judging Boomers why I want a gig stick for my car stereo.  If another Boomer says to me that my generation listens to newer music like rap because we can't cope with growing older, I will simply tell them to ""Shut the Fuck Up -- You have lost your right to say jack to us.  You failed us.""

After all, the Boomer generation ignored OBVIOUS economic and environmental warnings many. many times because of their glutinous consumerism of the 1980's and 90's. Boomers stupidly and willingly bought the lie that an economic bubble cannot burst. (Doh! The word bubble is a clue). Their generation also began the illogical mass exportation of industry over-seas.  Boomers drank the Voo-Doo economics kool aid and repackaged it to those that followed as the Free Market.  Social Security IS tanking because their generation justified paying their other debts with the principal. Boomer pharmaceutical companies hired experts to exagerate severity of diseases like toe fungus and convince countless sheeple they need to take deadly prescriptions for this. 

Not so long ago, a Boomer came to my house for coffee and conversation.  This woman actually had the nerve to petulantly tell me that even though she knew her generation blew the treasury, the environment and everything else - Why should they have to pay to fix it?  She continued to say that this was the next generation's problem.  After all, she said, her generation  had to pay for the mistakes of the Great generation.

Aside from her last thought being historically wrong, this woman was lucky I did not  pour hot coffee on her.

This attitude of blaming others and passing the buck seems to be prevalent among many Boomers.  There is no  rational justification for this Boomer view.  The Great generation did not leave Social Security dangling on the financial precipice as they are doing to us.  I know this because actual, valid historical documentation CAN be found on the inter tubes.  I am pretty certain their air and water quality was left in much better shape too.  (This ""willfull blindness just to shirk responsibility"" generation was warned in the 70's about the environment and over-consumption). 

I do NOT want to hear Boomers complain that Gen X is lackadaisical and not driven to success as their generation allegedly were.  Boomers can no longer complain about Gen X values or our generational interests without looking in the mirror first.

Baby Boomers raised us.  I imagine they do not remember this.  Their generation was too busy climbing the middle-class employment ladder just to buy bigger cars and more fur coats.  In the 80's, they replaced their love to us, their children, with bought things.  We had designer clothes and Nintendos...But all we wanted was their time.  This generation created mass epidemics of latch-key kids.  Their driving desire to get ahead in the work place left too many of us at home alone.  And when they were home, many Boomers tuned us out.

Therefore, Boomers can no longer shake their head and question what happened with us.  Boomers ARE what happened to us.

Their generation has created the worst political environment ever in the halls of Congress.  This generation has nurtured and cultivated FEAR as a means of control and making lots of money as well.  Boomer financial polices, over the years, led to this Recession. Additionally, the Boomers' have hamstrung fair and balanced journalism in this country.  They have also tanked the education system with their policies which is why kids are having problems now in schools.  Thanks for dumbing us down.  

By the way, the Boomers were the first generation to vainly create crap like Viagra before curing Cancer or the flu.  Seriously, the vanity of their generation is disturbing.  Exercising for health is one thing.  Elective ass implants are another.  I am sick and tired of hearing about people over 50 dying from botched plastic surgery.   They need to get a grip - At this age and above, nobody is supposed to look perfect.  No kidding...A friend's 60+ y.o. mother recently got a full set of braces. (!?!?)  Oh...NO more having kids...Boomers really do not care about those kids if they are having them this late in life. (Note to men over 50: Your sperm is f'ed up and WILL procreate dumber kids).

I should mention the wars the Boomers have wrongly led US into.  Look it up.  Most people dying in Afghanistan and Iraq are not from the Boomer generation.

Proof of the Boomer generational ignorance is seen in their inability to find the documented and unhidden history of Cannabis in America and rightly legalize it.  Yeah..This generation also crapped out on finding out who really killed JFK.


The Boomers have failed.

---------------------------------------

Yes. I listen to music like Jay Z, Mos Def, Owl City and Sigur Ros.  This is because I am wise enough to know that every generation AND culture has great music.  I am also self-educated enough to know about the therapeutic and intellectual benefits of music.  Yes. I have four computers networked to 2 X-Boxes and one Wii.  We bought these units used and rebuilt/refurbished them ourselves.  Yes.  I spend a some time on sites like FaceBook.  These sites have kept me better aware of  my dear and far-flung family/friends' daily stuff better than monthly phone calls can do.  I have NO problem that my husband is a Gamer.  Generation X's other option is too unwind with too much drink like Boomers do.  I easily use the internet to look-up anything that I do not know.  I easily admit that I LOVE the internet.  I am wise enough to realize that cyber space voids all excuses for ignorance.  I have learned to fix the plumbing and have helped my children to become straight A students with research from the internet.  We do not replace things.  We fix them right.  My husband and I choose to do with less material things so he can spend time with the kids instead of working over-time.  We have learned that an unnecessarily fancy car is NOT worth our children's precious time.  We have learned to help ourselves despite the example of our parents.

As I have shown with examples from my life, Generation X has learned a lot from Boomer mistakes.  Now it is time for the Boomers to shut up and listen to the younger generations.

We got a black man elected to the highest office in this land.  We support gay marriage and the legalizaton of marijuana.  We want real education in public schools for our kids.  (Those standardized tests and charter schools need to go back into the Boomer chest of tricks).  We use the internet to expand our knowledge and embrace other cultures.  

Our values may not be the same as Boomers, but this is evolution and progress in action.  We are a forward thinking generation with desperately tragic problems inherited from self-involved Boomer policies.

The Boomer generation HAS failed. They have no right to judge us for our lifestyle.  They have no right to insist that we should listen to their obviously rehased and repackaged ideas.  They have no right to keep forcing these same, corrupt ideas on us through our government.

Our elected Boomer politicians should take heed...We WILL start voting you out this next election.  Every one of you...After all, the Senate health care bill is clear evidence that Boomer Senators do not care about a single constituent under 50.  THIS IS AGEISM.  Generation X CAN  return the favor this next election by organizing the younger generations via the internet.

We ARE becoming more and more involved in politics.  We will out-maneuver your snarky political tactics with our cooperative and earnest multi-culturalism.

In 20 years or so and as a direct result of glutinous Boomer consumerism &amp; other policies, Generation X will have to make tough financial choices.  These choices could involve cutting things like medicaid in lieu of cleaning up this ungodly pollution so our children might actually have a decent future.

Poor farms could be Generation X's only solution for the remaining Boomers.  This is something that Boomer Senators and Congresspeople should remember when discussing the Public Option this month.  

Give us what we need now...And we will give you what you need when you are too old and senile to vote.

gaming,I wanna know from you gamers...,"So I started playing Morrowind about a week ago and as soon as I started it...I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Infact I've registered 49 hours of it (thats when xfire was on when I was playing it) and I used to go on till around 4 AM - 5 AM just playing the game (due to the large distance travels even then I enjoyed it)

And now suddenly...All of a sudden...One day I woke up...and its gone... :(
All that enjoyment of traveling long distance of pulling out an axe and beating a cliff racers balls to the ground is gone. All that fun of discovering new side quests and just wanting to know what happens next in the main quest is gone. I'm at the part where I've spoken to Lord Vivec and I have to fight Dagoth Ur but I just can't seem to muster up the enthusiasm to do it. Even though I know I can probably defeat him (I'm Level 27 Barbarian Nord with 100 Axe 100 Strength 94 Endurance 100 Acrobatics 80 Medium Armour 70 Blunt Weapons and some more stuff I can't remember) I *could* probably beat him. But I just can't find the enthusiasm to do it. 

And Oh No...It's not only Morrowind. It even happened to me with Civilizaton 4. For 3 days I loved the game. Couldn't stop playing. And then one day I woke up and I'm fed up of waiting ""one...more...turn""

I just want to know if this happens to other gamers as well? If they just really really enjoy a game so much that they enjoy it too much and kill the enjoyment all at once? LOL...It's crazy I know...But I dunno :S

I hope the same thing doesn't happen to me in long term relationships. Can't bear to have a 5th failed relationship :P",technology,2010-01-01,-0.1404316128565275

It looks like things are being done today. Question for the community is now whether I should delete this thread or keep it for stupid people like me in the future?

Thanks again for all of the advice everyone.

** Edit **

As most of you have told me, it's a really bad idea. I know that, and I wish I had a friend who trusted me already and could help me out once. Unfortunately I don't, and so I had to reach out in every way I could.

I openly admit I f'ed up on this project. There are so many things that I learned in managing this project. While I slaved away on updates to the iPhone app, I only tested on simulators and not real hardware. I was busy, and didn't do the job that I should have been doing of thoroughly testing the app on real hardware. There were many other ways that I failed on this project, and because of that I got in this situation.

Unfortunately now that I'm in the position and I haven't invented a time machine, I can't do anything except for reach out for help. We finally got a RIM employee to say, ""Tomorrow"" to us, so we're now waiting until tomorrow and seeing what happens. If we don't, it sounds like we might have a couple of people who have contacts at RIM that might be able to get us a more straight answer or help push some buttons.

I appreciate all of you who have offered advice and help. Hopefully tomorrow this own't be an issue anymore.

** Original Post **

We have had a heck of a time on this project, and it needs to be released for a time-sensitive reason by Wednesday, but the contractor didn't make us aware that we needed signing keys until last week. We immediately registered to get them, but RIM is silent and we're running out of time.

If anyone has any keys that we could use, I would be happy to go into more details about the project so that you can rest assured that we won't be abusing them. We will really only use them for this one build, and as soon as we get our own keys, we will cease use.

If you can be of help or know of anyone that can be of help, pm me here or email me jon @ myusername .com

Thanks for everyone who upvotes or at least doesn't downvote this in hopes of being able to help me out.",technology,2010-01-04,0.1393760650334282

gaming,Any redditors going to play Star Trek Online?,"The missus and I are completely tired of the clones available at the moment. Warhammer: capped and geared, WoW: jaded and won't play it again, Age of Conan: Capped and geared, Aion: Capped and geared (for the most part). They're all pretty much the same.

I was getting ready for some MW2 the other night and saw that STO (Star Trek Online) was launching soonish and they had the preorders up for purchase on Steam. I thought it was vaporware and stopped following it a while back, even though it looked quite interesting. Regardless, I've picked up 2 deluxe editions for launch.

From what I can tell, it's a lightweight Eve Online, but with the ability to take away teams to the surface of planets and space stations. After a little more reading, it seems quite massive in size and the engine it's running on is quite powerful. While not all the features they want (or the community wants) are going to be out for launch, they have a lot ""on the horizon"" that they wish to get out. The IP, engine and Genesis content engine give the game a wealth of non-linear expansion opportunities.

The team who's developed it so far are sticking around afterwards to continue content too. Which is a good thing.

It's episodic PvE a little like Lord of the Rings Online, but also has procedurally generated content like Diablo 2/3, which makes for unique stuff. Explore and discover (and name) planets/stars, create your own race or play one of the Federation races - or battle against them as a Klingon.

I'm not sure if my wife is going to like it, but it certainly has me interested. My wife says she may like it simply because she's sick of being in a fantasy game and this looks a hell of a lot different than anything she's played before. It'll take a lot for me to not like the game since I'm a Trek fan, space sim fan and 3rd person gaming fan.

I don't think it'll be a massive game, but I don't care. So long as the jocks from WAR, WoW and Aion don't come flocking (which, I doubt they will. I don't think this is their cup of tea) it should hopefuly have a tight-knit community.

Any fellow Redditors planning on take a shot at the game? It'd be good to get a few names to keep an eye out for in game. Open beta starts on the 12 Jan I believe, Feb is launch time.",technology,2010-01-07,0.0177335073868485

Then, without any warning, the game suddenly turns into one boss fight after another (those who have played it, it's Fortitudo, then Fortitudo, then Fortitudo, then Grace and Glory or whatever the hell they're called). Now witch time isn't an OPTION - you *have to use it all the time to beat them*. They may as well have created a rhythm game where you just have to hit the right trigger in time to a beat.

Con: It will lower the amount of money that banks have available to lend. Most industries when faced with a industry specific levee do indeed pass it on to the consumer (air, hotel, telecom, energy, etc ...). 

The free market champaign in me says no. On the other hand the free market (or perhaps the Fed and the SEC) created banks too big to fail.  But, if you're going to interfere, why not give a helping hand to the little guy? This tax is temporary and stifling, but more competition causes innovation and lasts a lot longer than a tax.

Only the other day we were fed up and disgusted with the previous party's rule. They looted the national wealth, took the country to war on lies to the nation, emptied the treasury in the name of war spending but in reality looting.

These activities of the previous government culminated in the breakdown of financial Institutions, that gave way to a catastrophic in flow of total devastation of financial, commercial, Industrial, even completely destroyed the government administrative machinery.

Especially the State department that became ineffective where upon the country became friendless.
The situation went to that far that citizens lost their job, remained without food and shelter and had to pass dreadful days and night under the shimmering blue sky in bad weathers.

And at that situation, time for the presidential election came up luckily. And the citizens were so disgusted and furious with the Republican partyâ€s tyrannical, unprecedented corrupt and unimaginable horrendous 8 years rule that the citizens wanted an immediate change.

On assuming the responsibilities as President Obama or the Democratic Party leadership under him retrieved the shattered State department functioning and made a land mark recovery in foreign policy and successfully got the Edifice of the country back and also got whole heart support of all the super powers.

politics,A little story about how liberals socialists caused the bankers to form a cartel and create the federal reserve,"It's true the banks conspired to create the FR, but what is not often mentioned is that they did so to protect themselves from socialist liberals and the unions.

In the early 1900's Theodore Roosevelt promised the farmers a handout.   Since they didn't have as much power to tax (like they do now), he promised the farmers a handout by fixing the exchange rate of silver to gold.   You see, at the time the farmers did most if their business using silver coins and most of the financial institutions did their business (and loans) using gold.  By fixing the exchange rate to over-value silver in proportion to gold, it would act like a subsidy to the farmers. 

The free market was paying 16 coins of silver per ounce of gold (I believe), but Roosevelt promised that the government would exchange gold from the treasury at 15 coins of silver per ounce of gold.   Well, the predictable result was that zillions of people would take 15 silver coins to the treasury, exchange it for gold, send that gold to Europe and get 16 silver coins.   It wasn't long before the US treasury lost almost all it's gold and the entire US government (and the financial system that loaned them money) was on the verge of complete collapse.

So what happened was that JP Morgan stepped up to the plate and bailed out the government and forced them to cancel the fixed exchange rate.   Of course, the politicians being the thankful creatures that they are portrayed him as the rich banker periah that took away everybody's free handout. 

So that's why the bankers conspired to create the federal Reserve. This way they could hand the government printed up money instead of real money.   Coincidently, the unions (backed by government) would violently strike any time they got lower pay even if that was the market rate.  By watering down the money, they could pretend to give the unions raises, even if they were getting decreases.  

Unfortunately, after the FR was created, it took a life on it's own, especially to finance WW1 and all the printed up money they loaned into the economy created a debt bubble that caused the great depression, like today.   Except, back then the money was backed by gold, so they couldn't recklessly print it up to pay down the debts and ruin all the common peoples savings and investments.

Our struggle is of our own as we face an enemy we can not subdue in 2 moves or less. That enemy, who concocts meticulous plans and possesses intricate knowledge of the 5 deadly poisons... is ourselves. But no more! We, as ninjas, will serve no one else! We will rise up against the corporate shogunate through our stealth, our secrecy, and most importantly... our Art of the Ninja!

And here is our political platform:

1.  The end of the Sham War. This is not even a real war. We are killing farmers and tradesmen not well fortified heads of aristocracy. It is not a challenge.

2.  Outlaw firearms. Guns are for the unskillful. Guards must be made to carry swords and bows like the good old days.

3.  Protect nature. What will ninjas hide in if they cut down all the trees?

4.  Legalization of drugs. How are we to acquire our poisons when all matters of toxic fluids are illegal to posses?

5.  Internet neutrality. Ninjas must coordinate, stealth is impossible underneath the guise of an ever present guard.

6.  End corporate personhood. How are we to kill a 3000 headed-hydra with just a katana? Having groups being classified as people hurts our business.

7.  Campaign spending limits. The shoguns will not employ ninjas if they are busy giving money to reporters to do the very same thing.

8.  Single-payer health care. Ninjas need to heal too sometimes. It's not fair if we give all our money that we have earned back to the shogunate to heal the wounds caught on the guard's sword.

Please, fellow ninjas hear this call! Heed my words and meet me at the 8 gates to start a revolution that will catch the shogunate off guard, in 2 moves or less.

He realizes that it will probably garner him no kills.  He only hopes that someone beside the person who rightfully killed him will get the kill.  It’s usually used by individuals who are fed up with being constantly raped and just want to annoy other people.  The real question is why this loser doesn’t just quit playing?

2.  The Witchblade - Marathon + Lightweight + Commando Pro = Cheap Bitch.  It does not take skill and quit telling yourself that it does.  Anybody can be successful with this.  You can kill anyone you can see by just clicking one button, and you don’t even have to aim.  Did the asshole stab the air next to you?  Yep, you’re still dead.  This asshole can kill you if you can hear him.  He can stab over, through, or around anything.  He can teleport across the room instantly and absorb absurd amounts of damage in transit.  Claymores don’t work.  It’s BS and you’re just a cheap cunt if you use it.

3.  The Dog Rapist - Are you using a shotgun over a century old?  Are you using a shotgun that’s short like your dick?  You’re an ass if the answer is yes to either one.

They should run out in front of you and let you kill them with your superior skills.  Did you really just call somebody a camper in a domination game?

politics,My letter to my congressman regarding healthcare reform and the latest supreme court ruling,"Due to the latest supreme court ruling and the course the current health care reform bill is taking, I felt it was time to express my views to my elected representatives again. While I understand that each of you might have your own opinions on these issues and might disagree with my opinions expressed in this letter, I feel it's vital for all of you to participate and to hold your government accountable. I truly believe a healthy democracy is one whose constituents are active participants, not passive consumers. In that spirit here is the letter I sent to my congressman:

Rep. Grijalva (representative for district 7),

   I am writing you to discuss two issues I feel very strongly about: the recent supreme court ruling overturning corporate campaign finance regulations, and the health reform bill currently in committee.

   I was appalled to hear that the supreme court has now extended first amendment free speech protections to corporate campaign financing. This follows a disturbing trend of court rulings granting constitutional rights to these artificial legal entities. The bill of rights was meant to protect individual citizens, not corporate interests. I fear that our country has been teetering on the line between democratic republic and plutocracy for some time now, and this ruling might be the event that tips us over that line in the wrong direction. I urge you to support legislature that challenges this ruling and puts strict limits on corporate influence in public elections. Ideally I'd like to see corporations prohibited entirely from funding political campaigns or campaign advertisements. I think to rid our government from the plague of corporate interests, limiting campaign financing exclusively to public funds is the only realistic solution.

   The second topic I'd like to discuss is the health care reform bill. While there are aspects of the bill which are admirable, (stricter regulations on insurance company practices and expanded consumer protections), I fear the bill in it's current form has been corrupted by insurance and medical corporate interests. I strongly believe the mandate forcing citizens to purchase private insurance is a mistake. It sets a terrible precedent in that it is the first federal law in our country's history which would require every citizen to purchase a government mandated private product. The implications of such a precedent honestly frightens me. Supporters have argued that there are similar mandates already in place for car insurance, but that is a straw man's argument because driving is a voluntary activity, living is not. Forcing uninsured people to buy private insurance, and then fining them because they can not afford it is not a solution to the problem. Rather it is a huge boon to private insurance companies, growing their customer base by millions through government coercion. Additionally, providing federal subsidies to pharmaceutical and insurance companies is inexcusable. These companies already reap billions from profiteering off of our broken health care system, so having these proposed subsidies in the bill can not be seen in any light other than corporate hand outs. I find it ironic that politicians cry fowl when the topic of social welfare is broached, and yet they have no qualms with corporate welfare be it in the form of these subsidies or other examples like the TARP bill. It speaks volumes about the motivations of such politicians that they value corporate campaign contributions over the obligations they have towards their constituents. I realize it is looked upon as politically unfavorable, but I believe we need to go back to the drawing board. The President started from a position of compromise in a misplaced attempt at bi-partisanship, and gave away too much bargaining power from the beginning. Bi-partisanship only works when the opposition is interested in compromise, which clearly they are not. Sadly I believe the GOP in it's current form values political power, and the act of attaining that power, more than it values the interests of it's citizens. While that generalization may not be true for every elected republican official, overall it has been the theme of that party's behavior since the President has come into office. As such, I'm afraid they are more interested in the political sabotage of the current government, than they are in solving our country's health care crisis. Personally I believe that our country has the ability to provide a single payer health care system. I would be happy to see an increase in the medicare tax, if it meant that all citizens were eligible for it's coverage. I think the UK is a great example for us to look to: they have a government run single payer system which covers all of it's citizens, but private insurance still exists for those who are willing to pay for it. If a country like UK, (with arguably less natural resources than the US), can accomplish this, then there is no excuse why we cannot.

Thank you for taking the time to listen to my concerns. I am grateful to have a congressman such as yourself whom I truly believe has the best interests of his constituents at heart. It was an honor to meet you at the DNC campaign head-quarters in Tucson, AZ during the '08 campaign, and you can count on my continued support in future elections.

How does Obama's ""Volcker Rule"" - financial regulation limiting the banks proprietary trading activities - do anything to actually change the root causes of the crisis?","It seems as if in the swirl of blame and outrage at the banks we've forgotten why the financial crisis actually happened.

A year ago, all or some of the following reasons were often cited as root causes of the crisis.  While obviously we still don't know which reasons were the most prominent, and the ordering may change depending on your political stripe, these explanations were the most common:

* Over-leveraged banks
* Lax underwriting standards
* Deceptive ratings agencies
* The distance between lender and borrower caused by securitization
* A pay structure in Finance that incentivizes risk taking
* Moral hazard: the privatization of profit and the socialization of losses
* The perverse role of Fannie/Freddie, causing too much capital to be siphoned into real estate
* Over-reliance on models like VaR that either understate volatility clustering or don't even take it into account
* Counter party risk inherent in OTC derivatives markets that have no centralized clearing house 
* Overly loose monetary policy by the Fed.

Again, I don't have all the answers.  I don't know which problem regulators should start with and I'm not sure all of them are inherently solvable.  But what I **do** know is that not a single major bank failed *because* of their proprietary trading.  Hell, the reason Goldman Sachs is still around is due to their prop trading!

Economics,Why I'm taking r/economics off my front page,"I submit to you that the r/economics community views its subject chiefly as a cudgel with which to advance a neopopulist political point of view, producing a content stream that is hopelessly skewed, and not useful to people with a general interest in economics.

The Federal Reserve is certainly an important topic within economics, but just as political and theological matters are crucially important to science, r/science still manages to cover its topic with breadth and genuine interest that go beyond the superficial utility of winning political and theological fights.

*Why is r/science healthier than r/economics?*

• 200K readers versus 40K probably helps diversify the content.

• R/atheism, boasts 68K readers, and absorbs much of the science-ish content that is redundant, amateurish, frivolous etc.

• R/science exhibits respect for mainstream ideas and trusted sources first. It has its share of crackpots, but it's also blessed with working professionals who are happy to explain the mainstream rudiments of their work with us and help quash the more sophomoric commenters who think they can make up in confidence what they lack in rigor. AND r/science has enough folks like me who know to look for those quality comments and send karma their way.

Any community has a potential dark side. I wouldn't want to be a conservative constitutional scholar in this era that every tea partying nutcase thinks they're one too. Maybe r/economics needs more members, maybe it needs less by siphoning people off into a neopopulism reddit.

I really don't have the expertise to help r/economics out of its current state; I joined out of general interest. So I'll be getting my content elsewhere, namely NPR's ""Planet Money"" and ""Marketplace"", and the regular updates from bea.gov and The Conference Board. 

Of course I'll be checking in, especially if this post goes anywhere.

politics,Rev. Feldmeyer's editorial on health care is probably the best thing you will read all day...,"**Requiescat in Pace: Health care reform**

Is there no balm in Gilead?
Is there no physician there?
Why then is there no healing
For the wound of my people?
Jeremiah 8: 22

Break out the champagne,
brothers and sisters. It’s time to
celebrate. That horrid monster,
that threat to all that is beautiful
and holy, that enemy of all
that is good and decent and
American — health care
reform — is dead.

The minority have ruled.
The tea baggers have won. The
insurance industry lobbyists
are victorious. We can all rest
easy; nothing will be done.
And nothing should be done,
should it? I mean, everything
is just fine the way it is. To
suggest otherwise is un-
American, unpatriotic, liberal
and, well, expensive. Not as
expensive as fighting two
simultaneous wars, but darned
expensive.

Now we can slow things
down and treat this issue judiciously
and seriously. After all,
we’ve only been talking about
it since 1912.What’s the rush?

Besides, the federal government
is incapable of running
anything efficiently and
well, and if they started running
health care, they would
run it so efficiently and well
that they would drive private
insurers out of business. And
we all know that insurance
companies are the ones best
equipped and motivated to run
the health care industry in this
country.

Unlike our democratically
elected government, insurance
companies have our best interest
at heart. Everyone knows
that. What about the 40-plus
million people who aren’t
insured, you ask?

Well we are a Christian
nation, after all. We don’t
believe in making sacrifices to
help them or the one million
who will go bankrupt this year
because of medical expenses,
or the 18,000 who will die
because they can’t afford medical
care. Besides, people who
don’t have insurance probably
didn’t even want it in the first
place. If they wanted good
insurance, they would get a
good job like the rest of us.

If they wanted to be healthy
they wouldn’t get sick or
injured, would they? Duh!
Set off the fireworks. Strike
up the band. Let the party
begin. Even though we pool
our resources to provide roads,
schools, clean water, military,
police, food inspection, building
inspection, bridge inspection,
and fire protection we
won’t be pooling our resources
for medical care because that
would be socialism.

Besides, health care reform
is just too darned expensive.
It’s not too expensive for
Israel, Afghanistan or Iraq, all
of which we subsidize, but it’s
too expensive for us.
Even though single-payer,
government-run health care is
just fine for our armed forces
and our military veterans —
for whom we claim nothing is
too good — it’s not good
enough for us.

It’s affordable for the armed
forces, but it’s not affordable
for the rest of us.
And thank heavens people
won’t be talking about end-oflife
care with their physicians.
Doctors will just have to guess
what their patients want, like
they did in the good old days. I
don’t know what all the fuss
was, anyway.

We already have universal
health care. It’s called the
emergency room. Anyone can
take their medical care problems
there and, because our
hospitals are caring, humanitarian
agencies, they will treat
these people regardless of their
ability to pay.

Then the cost will just be
passed on to those of us who
are insured and our rates will
go up.  Or the hospital will have to
be sold to some other big company
because local, regional
hospitals just can’t afford to
operate as local entities any
more.

Yes sir! Wave the flag. Sing
out loud. This is something to
celebrate.

Economics,Tired of Chase Bank punishing people for being poor - My Rant.,"The following is a semi-humorous rant I wrote to Chase after they humped me with insufficient funds fees:

To whom it may concern:

I must discuss my current level of disgust with Chase Bank and their policies. Recently, I was fortunate enough to get caught in the death trap of insufficient funds fees. What these fees appear to be to me are nothing more than a punishment for being poor. I am struggling right now to make ends meet, as I am sure many others are; to go on tacking fee after fee onto people with no money seems to be the equivalent of repeatedly kicking someone while down. How can you justify tacking on fee after fee when a person is already in the hole? One fee I might be able to understand, but to tack one on after the other seems cruel and unjust. How in the world was the fee amount of $33 reached? Shouldn’t the fee be based on the amount that a customer exceeded his balance limit? At one point I went $0.71 under my account limit; do you feel that $33 is a reasonable fee for $0.71? Chase Bank has assessed me with $165 in fees over a five day period. How can you justify this? Are you trying to help your customers, or punish them when they are in their period of most need? All this coming from a corporation that willingly took an enormous bailout from the Federal Government, which in the end will be funded by me and people like me; through legal plunder you have stolen my money and then punished me for not having anymore. Frankly, I am tired of calling your customer service to talk with people who provide me with a level of fake empathy which I find to be disgusting and down right insulting. I call only to talk with people whom might as well be robots; there is no deviation from the script. I call customer service to have a legitimate conversation with someone who might hear and understand my plea, not to speak with someone who cannot think outside of the lines provided to them. The only help gained from asking to speak to a supervisor is an increased level of aggression and a harder stance towards the company line. The best line I have heard all year was in regards to me saying I have no money in my account and Chase is punishing me for being poor, to which the person responded “Sir, we are not charging you for not having any money, we are charging you for insufficient funds.” Can the employees not even think far enough outside the box to realize they are the same thing! Chase you were bailed out and rewarded for being irresponsible, I am a little guy trying to make ends meet, why not help me out in my time of need?

politics,Was the Public Option under your nose all along?,"I'm not really a big gung-ho Public Option advocate, but I am interested in political strategy and tactics.  From my perspective, Dems jumped the shark on this one when they could have had a very easy win.

During the health care debate, if you could hear over the din, Repubs made several proposals... most notably: Tort Reform, Removing the monopoly exclusion for insurance companies, selling insurance over state lines and coops.  - I think all of these would actually have benefited the average consumer in the price game but even all together they don't add up to anything that can be called 'comprehensive'.  ANYWAY, the important one is the coops or cooperatives.  Basically this is a system where groups of people band together to buy insurance collectively and thereby get a better price.  Often they are non-profit and thus can include people who would normally be turned away AND still bargain for a better price because they have only a tiny overhead cost.

NOW, in my mind, Dems should have pounced on this - which would have brought some Repubs on board (possibly even incorporated ALL of the major R ideas I listed which would have brought more on board - none of the ideas are actually bad).  Adding one caveat - a safety net.  Just in case a coop goes under, the government is there to pick up the slack and make it a quasi federal plan - much like Fanny and Freddie.  Whalla - you have your public option AND get to let the Free Market have its crack at it first... if it works, all the better.

The Dems didn't actually miss this imo.  I think that they made a deal precluding the Public Option from the get-go.  The deal included certain members and those in leadership positions being able to portray themselves as fighting the good fight and eventually losing.  It seems quite apparent if you look at their starting position in the debate which logically had to give ground.",finance,2010-02-02,0.0668419281638377

Reasonably recently it started randomly blue screening in xp. Various memory related problems. I never saw an issue when booted to linux, memtest86 ran cleanly. I noticed that it had an old beta bios installed (the bios it was shipped with), so I decided to upgrade. I used the upgrade tool inside the BIOS to flash to the latest version - everything appeared to go fine (confirmed BIOS was for the right board, update and verify worked). However, when the machine is powered on it just spins all fans and does some access to the dvd drive.

This mobo apparently has a crashfree 3 bios, but I can't get it to boot anything from dvd (tried freedos, fedora, original mobo cdrom). If I remove all memory it does beep on power on, but I can't get beeps out of it any other way. Nothing is displayed on the screen. I've removed all cards (video (it has on-board video too) and firewire) and tried a single DIMM in each slot. I removed the battery and cleared the CMOS memory.

It seems that Asus decided to solder the BIOS onto the motherboard - I'm sure my patience and soldering skills aren't up to replacing that. Any thoughts on whether this can be revived?

Thanks in advance.


Update: Thanks for the responses. The video card is a Radeon HD 3870, but removing it doesn't improve things. I tried a number of new fixes from the asus forum link, but no luck. So it looks like upgrade time is coming around early.

The fines raised on this cash strapped population, also known as wall street's customer base, have buoyed bailed out wall street bank giants to their greatest heights ever as hundreds of small business banks, and community banks with less exposure to the mortgage crisis are going under.

What I'm saying is that just like these cash strapped people that are paying these huge fines because they couldn't balance their books, these banks that are charging the fines are overdrawn on THEIR accounts.

The banks making hundreds of billions collecting fines were overdrawn themselves.

When wall street went to the federal reserve to restructure the loan that THEY couldn't make the payments on the fed, congress, and the American People understood that at a time of crisis when the financial system is as fragile as bone china, charging outrageous fines would be shortsighted.  It would be great in the short term, but it would almost guarantee the economy would shatter like a teacup.

Yet neither Wall Street nor Congress see either the hypocrisy, or the obvious fact that these predatory fines are stifling the economy as much as anything.

Over and over politicians have talked about how it's better to avoid foreclosures.  At the height of the afterglow even wall street professed an understanding that it would be better in the long run to prevent many of the foreclosures.

    THE ANT AND THE GRASSHOPPER 

    This one is a little different.... Two Different Versions....................  Two Different Morals

    OLD VERSION

    The ant works hard in the withering heat all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter. 

    The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.. 

    Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed. 

    The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.

MORAL OF THE STORY: Be responsible for yourself!




MODERN VERSION

The ant works hard in the withering heat and the rain all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.

The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away. 

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while he is cold and starving. 

CBS, NBC , PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshoppernext to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food. 

America is stunned by the sharp contrast. 

How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so? 

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing, 'It's Not Easy Being Green.' 

Acorn stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing, 'We shall overcome.' Rev. Jeremiah Wright  then has the group kneel down to pray to God for the grasshopper's  sake. 

President Obama condemns the ant and blames President Bush, President Reagan, Christopher Columbus, and the Popefor the grasshopper's plight.

Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid exclaim in an interview with Larry King that the ant has gotten rich off the back of thegrasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share. 

Finally, the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity &amp; Anti-Grasshopper Act retroactive to the beginning of the summer. 

The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the Government Green Czar and given to the grasshopper . 

The story ends as we see the grasshopper and his free-loading friends finishing up the last bits of the ant's food while the government house he is in, which, as you recall, just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around them because thegrasshopper doesn't maintain it. 

The ant has disappeared in the snow, never to be seen again. 

The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident, and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiderswho terrorize the ramshackle, once prosperous and once peaceful, neighborhood.

The entire Nation collapses bringing the rest of the free world with it.

ARMEY: We protect and cherish freedom because it is precious in its own right and because it works. So let's give them the message: Freedom Works! Freedom Works! Thank you for letting me be here.

BILL MOYERS: He should know.

They called it ""Hillary Care"" back then and Armey's main adversary was ...Guess who?
*******
When Dick Armey taught economics at the University of North Texas for 13 years his health insurance was administered by the state and supplemented by the taxpayers.

When he was elected to Congress, he was covered by the federal employees' health benefit plan. And when he retired from Congress eighteen years later, he was insured by that plan until he turned 66 and Medicare, another government program, kicked in. All the time he's been making some half a million dollars a year working for FreedomWorks and raking in lobbyist fees amounting to what he recently called ""a darned handsome pile of dough.""

You can't blame him for keeping his government health plan. It's great. It gave him a lot of options, dozens of private insurers to choose from, and with eight million members in it, the federal government's got the muscle to negotiate some of the best premiums and drug prices in the country. That's not all. Taxpayers subsidize these federal health insurance plans by as much as 75% of the premium cost. Beneficiaries -- including members and retired members of congress like armey -- pay their share of the premiums with pre-tax dollars.

Not bad.

You may ask if they want to control inflation why don't they just raise the interest rate?  They are trying to avoid doing that at all costs because it will increase the amount the government has to pay on its debt.  But remember, that rate *has to come up sometime.* [We paid 164 billion on interest in the past 3 months alone](http://www.treasurydirect.gov/govt/reports/ir/ir_expense.htm), imagine how that number will rise in the coming years. So in lieu of raising rates came up with this gem which amounts to handing out more free money to the banks.  What I want to know is why don't they just raise the reserve requirements?  Maybe they're afraid of the instability it would cause.


This is not the only instance in which banks were encouraged not to lend.  In fact the whole system encourages them not to lend, at least not to consumers.  Instead they take the free money they get at the federal reserve and [use it to buy government debt](http://www.businessinsider.com/henry-blodget-how-to-make-the-worlds-easiest-10-billion-2009-12) which earns them interest.  It's the easiest money those banks have ever made.


Another way they are encouraged not to lend is done by the FDIC.  When a bad bank goes bad the FDIC breaks up their assets and distributes them to healthy banks.  This is an amazing deal for any bank to get and is much more profitable than lending.  As a result banks have [cut lending and are hording cash](http://www.businessinsider.com/the-real-reason-banks-arent-lending-will-shock-you-2010-1) in order to improve their ""health"" and make sure they are on the receiving end of one of these transfers.

I have never read so many unintelligent (rephrase uneducated) people comment on something they obviously have no understanding of, but I'm new to blogging... You all talk about how this guy is screwing the system, you are obviously brainwashed by the mass media that is in part to blame for the current economic state, let's not go taking that out of context, I said ""IN PART"". 

Yes, this guy didn’t make his payment (let’s give him the benefit of the doubt), the question you have completely skipped over is that it is an 80/20 loan and anyone that knows anything about mortgage finance in the 2000's, should know that the majority of 80/20 loans written were short term ARMs (aka. Adjustable Rate Mortgages - 2,3,5,7,10 year fixed).

 So the problem most people faced is that they can/could afford the homes at the rate they were given and were directed to believe that they would be able to refinance before their loan adjusted, but with the decline in values made it impossible. “He should have educated himself” you say! What is a “20 something” or any common American for that fact, to think when even the banks didn’t anticipate such a debacle and guess what!? Those running the banks at that time, also run the department of treasury and Federal Reserve. (Not simultaneously, obviously) If those people that we look to for guidance as a Country couldn’t get it right, how could we expect better from anyone else? So please educate me on how you people can say whatever you think is right with no actual of proof or understanding. 

OK BOTTOM LINE. People not paying their mortgages has added to the current issue. The banks not accurately accounting for this is the real issue. Understand that they only had enough reserves on hand for a very small default rate and due to mortgage derivatives it was impossible to accurately account for the Actual needed reserves. The real issue at hand is the only reason this is an issue to the “American People” AND quite literally the world as a whole (the largest purchaser’s of MBS’s) is because we were scared into a “Bailout” which was the stupidest thing we could have done. If you ran a business and basically FUBR’ed because of your GREED/incredulousness why would anyone give you a cent to recover…Guess what?

programming,Request for Comment: Shared Key authentication in MySQL,"I have been using Shared Key authentication for SSH for quite some time, to eliminate the need for using a username and password each time I need to log into certain servers. It makes sense, as I can retain the same password for a user account on that remote server, even if my connection is being sniffed, as that shared key is linked to each system I generate it for, and is quickly revocable on the server side.

A while back, I had a conversation with a Sun employee, who works on MySQL. I had suggested that they implement Shared Key authentication in MySQL, for many of the same reasons that it's useful in SSH. They thought it was an interesting proposition at the time.

I brought it back up today, in an IRC channel, and one individual thought it was better to implement this via tunnelling, rather than handling it directly in the database server.

That if there were no banks there would be no credit and no lending and the economy would collapse. Is this true? What if there were no banks? I mean no banks at all and certainly no Fed.

We would still have currency, people have chosen gold and silver as a medium of exchange for centuries. Prices would be priced and gold and silver. People would still be able to lend money to each other or companies. Credit expansion would be based on real savings so there would be no credit bubbles and no recessions. Interest rates would be set by the market, the more people are willing to save (they will be more willing since they are confident the currency won't be inflated away) the lower the interest rate.

Stable economy, no recessions, no need for bailouts or corporate welfare. The government would have to fund all welfare entitlements and wars through direct taxation, severely limiting the power of the government and making the warfare/welfare state far less popular.

*Which also includes this inspiring sentiment:*

&gt;In all those things which deal with people, be liberal, be human.


*And this:*

&gt;Government must have a heart as well as a head. 


*A foreign policy based on international cooperation:*

&gt;We shall continue vigorously to support the United Nations. 


*A call to civil service:*

&gt;We will vigorously promote, as we have in the past, a non-political career service under the merit system which will attract and retain able servants of the people. 


*Progressive taxation:*

&gt;Further reductions in taxes with particular consideration for low and middle income families. 


*Infrastructure:*

&gt;To meet the immense demands of our expanding economy, we [will initiate] the largest highway, air and maritime programs in history, each soundly financed. 


*Statehood for D.C.:*

&gt;We favor self-government, national suffrage and representation in the Congress of the United States for residents of the District of Columbia. 


*Environmentalism:*

&gt;We favor a comprehensive study of the effect upon wildlife of the drainage of our wetlands.

&gt;We recognize the need for maintaining isolated wilderness areas


*Taking on big business:*

&gt;A continuously vigorous enforcement of anti-trust laws

&gt;Legislation to enable closer Federal scrutiny of mergers which have a significant or potential monopolistic connotations;

&gt;Procedural changes in the antitrust laws to facilitate their enforcement.  


*But wait, it gets even better. Just look at how pro-labor it is:*

&gt;Extend the protection of the Federal minimum wage laws to as many more workers as is possible and practicable.

&gt;Stimulate improved job safety of our workers, through assistance to the States, employees and employers.

&gt;Assure equal pay for equal work regardless of Sex.

&gt;Clarify and strengthen the eight-hour laws for the benefit of workers who are subject to federal wage standards...

&gt;Revise and improve the Taft-Hartley Act so as to protect more effectively the rights of labor unions, management, the individual worker, and the public.


*It even favors bringing back the Equal Rights Amendment!*

&gt;We recommend to Congress the submission of a constitutional amendment providing equal rights for men and women.


Public works projects. 

Equal pay for equal work. 

Environmentalism. 

Antitrust enforcement. 

Even the fricking ERA. 

Holy cow, who on earth is proposing such unabashedly progressive ideals? 

Who is unafraid to use the word ""liberal"" to describe their values? 

Can you possibly guess?


It's the [Republican Party Platform of 1956](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=25838).

Cast Your Vote to Determine the Contract From America

Here, for the first time, are the 22 solutions to be voted on beginning tomorrow:

    DEMAND A BALANCED BUDGET: Begin the Constitutional amendment process to require a balanced budget with a two-thirds majority needed for any tax hike.

    STOP THE TAX HIKES: Permanently repeal all tax hikes, including those to income, capital gains, and death taxes, currently scheduled to begin in 2011.

    COMMIT TO REAL GOVERNMENT TRANSPARENCY: Every bill, in its final form, will be made public seven days before any vote can be taken and all government expenditures authorized by any bill will be easily accessible on the Internet before the money is spent. (Proposed by: Steve Kulik, Gonzales, Texas; and Steve Hollis, San Francisco, Calif.)

    PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION: Require each bill to identify the specific provision of the Constitution that gives Congress the power to do what the bill does.

    PASS REAL HEALTHCARE REFORM: Greatly improve affordability of health insurance by permitting all Americans access to all health insurance plans sold anywhere in the United States through the purchase of insurance across state lines and allow small businesses and associations to pool together across state lines to buy insurance.

    ENACT FUNDAMENTAL TAX REFORM: Adopt a simple and fair single-rate tax system by scrapping the Internal Revenue code and replacing it with one that is no longer than 4,543 words—the length of the original Constitution.

    END RUNAWAY GOVERNMENT SPENDING: Impose a statutory cap limiting the annual growth in total federal spending to the sum of inflation rate plus the percentage of population growth.

    LET US SAVE: Allow all Americans to opt out of Social Security and Medicare and instead put those same payroll taxes in a personal account they own, control, and can leave to whomever they choose.

    PROTECT INTERNET FREEDOM: No regulation or tax on the Internet.

    GIVE PARENTS MORE CHOICES IN THE EDUCATION OF THEIR CHILDREN: Improve American education by reforming the broken federal role through eliminating ineffective and wasteful programs, giving parents more choices from pre-school to high school, and improving the affordability of higher education.

    PASS AN 'ALL OF THE ABOVE' ENERGY POLICY: Authorize the exploration of proven energy reserves to reduce our dependence on foreign energy sources from unstable countries and reduce regulatory barriers to all other forms of energy creation, lowering prices and creating competition.

    PROTECT FREEDOM OF THE PRESS: Prohibit the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from using funds to reinstate the Fairness Doctrine in any form, including requiring ""localism"" or ""diversity"" quotas.

    RESTORE FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY &amp; CONSTITUTIONALLY LIMITED GOVERNMENT: Create a Blue Ribbon taskforce that engages in a complete audit of federal agencies and programs, assessing their Constitutionality, and identifying duplication, waste, ineffectiveness, and agencies and programs better left for the states.

    PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS: Block state and local governments that receive federal grants from exercising eminent domain over private property for the primary purpose of economic development or enhancement of tax revenues.

    REJECT CAP &amp; TRADE: Prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from implementing costly new regulations that would increase unemployment, raise consumer prices, and weaken the nation's global competitiveness with virtually no impact on global temperatures.

    STOP THE PORK: Place a moratorium on all earmarks until the process is fully transparent, including requiring a 2/3 majority to pass any earmark.

    NO CZAR REGULATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION: All ""lawmaking"" regulations must be affirmatively approved by Congress and signed into law by the president, as the Constitution requires for all laws.

    AUDIT THE FED: Begin an audit of the Federal Reserve System.

    NO MORE BAILOUTS: The federal government should not bail out private companies and should immediately begin divesting itself of its stake in the private companies it owns from recent bailouts.

    STOP CAREER POLITICIANS &amp; CURB LOBBYIST POWER: Begin the Constitutional amendment process to require Congressional term limits. No person shall be elected to the Senate more than twice or to the House of Representatives more than four times.

    SUNSET REGULATIONS: All regulations will be ""sunset"" after ten years unless renewed by Congressional vote.

    LET US WATCH: Broadcast all non-security meetings and votes on C-SPAN and the Internet.",energy,2010-02-17,0.0060530321505766

Economics,"Ask Econ: Given why a housing bubble happened, how is there not an education bubble?","From what I understand, one of the driving factors of the housing bubble was easy access to money, producing a glut of buyers against a fixed supply.

With Stafford loans and easy access to education loans, getting money for a degree is *easier* than getting money for a house was. So there's a glut of buyers, and a fixed supply of seats entering college.

So looking at the growth of tuition over the past fifteen years, and considering that those tuition increases are unsupported by necessity (inflation has been low, interest rates have been low, fuel prices have generally been low, increases in efficiency through IT should have saved administrative costs, etc), what is the counter-argument to ""tuition prices have gone up so much *as a direct result of* easy access to education money""?",finance,2010-02-17,0.1224221336300194

I'm going to explain the idea of stimulus via tax cuts and government works, and i'd like someone to tell me where I'm wrong. Frankly, it's what I've been taught and what I've read, so getting another economic opinion would be nice:

in macroeconomics, GDP can roughly be estimated like this:
Y = c(Y - T - S) + G + I
Y is GDP, c is a multiplier that's essentially a function of banking leverage, T is taxes, S is savings, G is government spending, and I is investment.

We can optimize this to maximize GDP, which is what happens in an efficient free market. But that's completely unrealistic.

During a recession, I is down. This lowers Y, which in turn lowers Y even further because of the multiplier. In reality, what's happening is income for businesses is down, so they don't hire as much, so people spend less, so income for businesses is down, so they don't hire as much... you see where i'm going.

The economy gets stuck here. You get sustained reduction in GDP as the ""natural"" level of unemployment as a function of Y rises. The system takes a very long time to right itself on its own. We are impatient. This is where stimulus comes in.

First, you lower interest rates and increase government lending. This causes inflation, but that's ok because recessions suck. This should increase I. However, if you are in a recession already, the impact of the increase in I is reduced simply because you have a decreased return on investment. So what do we do?

Ideally, we reduce T. Economically efficient people (which we are not) spend their money optimally, and reducing T essentially gives them more money to spend. However, there are several problems with this. First, those that aren't affected as strongly by the recession, i.e. the rich, will just save their money. Investment is not worthwhile, and they have no need to spend outside their means. None of that money goes into the economy. Similarly, when you have massive consumer debt like we do now, people rather than spending their money will pay off their debt. Again, none of that touches the multiplier.

Well, shit. Now what? Government spending. Government is willing to spend when nobody else does. It creates jobs and kick-starts the economy when private business won't. Public works projects are some of the best ways to get people back to work and spending money in a recession or depression. Dodger, you claimed that this is like the housing bubble. The thing is, we are not at our optimal GDP yet. Rather than spending outside our macroeconomic means, we are at entirely suboptimal unemployment, consumer spending, and investment. This is what keynsian stimulus is meant to get going again.

politics,Will H1 employment be phased out by the government?  New regulations being handed down to staffing firms regarding who can be presented to companies.,"(This was posted today via Staffing Industry Analysts.  It could also mean the end of staffing firms utilizing H1 candidates over US citizen and Green Card candidates in employment.  This may have a HUGE impact on the direction of IT staffing in the United States as, in general, nearly all Fortune 500 companies are employing huge numbers of H1 contractors.  I've been working as an IT recruiter for the last 6 years and can honestly say that if this regulations stays as it is, the need for US citizen and Green Card employees in IT will grow tremendously and also as a possible consequence Fortune 500 companies may just begin to outsource entire IT departments overseas if they can't meet the demand here in the US.  A double edged sword that will have many effects here.)

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration services heard complaints during a public hearing Thursday over a memorandum that restricts staffing firms' ability to bring in foreign workers on H-1B visas.
Separately, some organizations are considering a lawsuit against the agency over the memo.

Background and analysis
""We see this as a major threat -- it's an attack on the staffing industry's business model,"" said Mark Roberts, CEO of the TechServe Alliance, a collaboration of information technology services firms, clients, consultants and suppliers.

""We're evaluating moving forward with litigation against the agency,"" Roberts said. ""The memorandum is an incorrect interpretation of law.""

Employers use H-1B visas to bring in workers with college degrees who have special skills. The memo's restrictions would impact IT staffing firms as well as healthcare staffing firms, particularly those who bring in doctors and allied healthcare professionals.

The TechServe Alliance is working with other groups, including the American Staffing Association, Roberts said.

There have already been reports of workers being turned back at the border, and the memo has created a chilling effect among workers, he said.

And although the memo came out in January, difficulties began building earlier following a 2008 report on H-1B visa fraud and corresponding political pressure from Capitol Hill, Roberts said. 

Early on, a USCIS checklist was inadvertently released publicly subjecting some staffing firms to greater scrutiny. The checklist stated H-1B requests from any IT staffing operation less than 10 years old and with less than $10 million in revenue would automatically be referred to the fraud division, according to Roberts. 

There also appeared greater intrusion into the relationship between staffing firms and buyers through requests for evidence by USCIS officials, Roberts said. The officials started demanding letters from staffing clients and even demanding to speak with clients, he said.

""You started to see this increasing hostility toward the IT staffing business model,"" Roberts said. That ultimately culminated in the memorandum.

The memo
Employers apply for H-1B visas on behalf of workers, and the memo provides examples of what represents an employer-employee relationship and what doesn't.

Two examples of what doesn't represent an employer-employee relationship include ""third-party placement/'job shop'"" and ""independent contractors."" The staffing firm business model doesn't qualify, according to the memo, because a staffing firm does not maintain control over an employee's daily tasks.

""They're basically saying the employer relationship rides on whether you control the actual day-to-day work activities of the employee,"" said Mike Hammond, an attorney with the Hammond Law Group LLC. 

And that's at odds with other agencies' definition of the relationship, Hammond said. ""There's not a single other federal agency or state agency that has found that there wasn't an employer-employee relationship in the staffing model.""

The memo primarily impacts IT and healthcare staffing -- especially companies that provide allied health and physicians, Hammond said. Already, he said he has seen a denial in the case of an IT worker. And the memo would impact both new H-1B visas and those coming up for renewal.

Hammond said he was encouraged by Thursday's meeting, and said USCIS officials on hand actually appeared to be listening to the concerns.

Thursday's public hearing, held in Washington, attracted between 40 and 50 people in person and as many as 600 people called in on a conference line. Hammond, who attended the meeting in person, said the unusually large attendance shocked the officials.

""However, I'm still not convinced that without litigation anything dramatic is going to be done,"" he said. ""There is an attitude at the (USCIS) service centers that staffing and the staffing model is bad.""

There's also a lot of political pressure from Capital Hill from places such as Sen . Chuck Grassley's office, Hammond said.

Pressure
""My basic take is that the memorandum is plainly as a result of a lot of political pressures being put on USCIS,"" said Chris Musillo, an immigration attorney with MusilloUnkenholt Immigration Law ""It's clearly aimed at restricting the use of the H-1B...the memorandum that came out, and I think this unquestionably true, is fairly weakly grounded in law; and because of that I do think if it is challenged I think they USCIS would likely lose.""

USCIS officials on Thursday indicated another public meeting on the memo could take place in March. And Musillo said the agency will likely query its local offices to see if there's a material change in the number of H-1B visa denials. 

The agency may then pull the memo or keep it out there but not really rely on it, he said. A third possibility is that the agency gets sued.

Greg Siskind, an immigration attorney and founding partner of Siskind Susser, said the memo will have a definite chilling effect on staffing firms as well as ""a chilling effect downstream where the prospective client site has heard about it.""

Siskind said he has worked on one case where a healthcare staffing firm's hospital client became concerned after hearing about the memo.

In addition to an apparent inaccurate definition of an employer, the memo also doesn't appear to have gone through Administrative Procedures Act requirements properly or Paperwork Reduction Act requirements, he said. 

The Paperwork Reduction Act aims to oversee government collection of information including preventing overly burdensome requests. However, Siskin said one request for information from a USCIS operative was for a hospital, a staffing firm client, to provide a list of every nurse that it has employed in its 75-year history.

Several speakers in Thursday's public hearing rose concerns against the memo.

""I think this memo is completely off basis with respect to its analysis of [staffing industry] employment structure,"" said Bruce Morrison, a former Connecticut congressman who was representing AMN Healthcare Services Inc.

The staffing industry ""really deserves a separate look and a separate set of rules to follow,"" Morrison said.

Morrison said he wrote H-1B as a member of Congress.

Other speakers said restricting H-1Bs from staffing firms could simply cause large firms to shift work overseas. 

Another said a number of IT staffing companies in New Jersey have closed down because of the memo. In addition, the speaker said H-1B visa holders pay taxes, their knowledge remains in this country and H-1B limitations may convince masters' degree students to not come to the U.S.

The speaker also asked whether refunds would be available in cases where H-1B visas are denied. Separately, Siskind said it can cost more than $3,000 to file an H-1B petition.

Not all speakers or callers opposed the H-1B restrictions for staffing firms. One of those speaking in favor of the limitations said ""employers want inexpensive, young blood,"" and said that although he had a doctorate in Radiation Biophysics, he was out of work.

Staffing Industry Analysts' perspective 
For staffing firms relying on H-1B visas as a key recruitment tool, recent restrictions seemingly aimed at such firms will be a significant blow. Firms employing H-1B visas are most commonly found in the IT and healthcare segments, where U.S. skills shortage has driven such firms to seek talent abroad. 
The fight on this is not over -- the industry will no doubt respond through lobbying efforts as well as potential lawsuits. However, the damage is likely already under way.  Buyers nowadays are nervous (and legitimately so) regarding legal issues, so the hint of fed opposition to foreign workers through temp agencies will act as a current tax on such transactions even if the new restrictions are ultimately reversed down the road.

Additionally, skilled foreign workers are not quite as desperate as they used to be.  Opportunities in their home countries are rapidly improving. Infighting within U.S. interests as to whether we really want talented people to come here is bound to diminish interest.

Staffing firm use of H1-B visas has been limited for years due to other issues. Now it will be further so.",technology,2010-02-19,-0.678109881480153

Economics,The fiscal stimulus package was a mistake,"The Stimulus Evidence One Year On
Over five years, my research shows an extra $600 billion of public spending at the cost of $900 billion in private expenditure. That's a bad deal.

By ROBERT J. BARRO

The first anniversary of the Obama stimulus package generated a lot of discussion about whether and how much the package (originally estimated at $787 billion but now priced at $862 billion) moderated the recession. These are complex questions, and their answers require more than merely counting the quantity of goods and services that the government purchased or the number of people that the government hired.

We need to ask whether the government's spending reduced or enhanced private spending and whether public-sector hiring lowered or raised private hiring. This requires an empirical model based on the history of past fiscal actions in the U.S. or other countries. The administration must have such a model, but my own analysis makes me skeptical about the numbers they've reported about GDP increases and saved jobs.

To realistically evaluate the stimulus, I've been using long-term U.S. macroeconomic data to estimate some key economic relationships: the effects on GDP from increased government purchases (the spending multiplier) and from increased taxes (the tax multiplier).

For spending, the main results come from fluctuations in defense outlays associated with major wars such as World War I, World War II and the Korean War. The data feature large positive values in the early stages of wars (extra spending of 26% of GDP in 1942) and large negative values in war aftermaths (27% of GDP in 1946).

Although stimulus packages usually concentrate on nondefense outlays, the information from defense spending is useful for two reasons. First, the defense-spending multiplier can be precisely estimated from the available data and, second, this multiplier provides a reasonable gauge (and likely an upper bound because of the strong wartime boost to labor supply due to patriotism) for the effects of nondefense government purchases.

I estimate a spending multiplier of around 0.4 within the same year and about 0.6 over two years. Thus, if the government spends an extra $300 billion in each of 2009 and 2010, GDP would be higher than otherwise by $120 billion in 2009 and $180 billion in 2010. These results apply for given taxes and, therefore, when spending is deficit-financed, as in 2009 and 2010. Since the multipliers are less than one, the heightened government outlays reduce other parts of GDP such as personal consumer expenditure, private domestic investment and net exports.

For taxes, I focus on a newly constructed measure of average marginal income-tax rates; these rates apply to federal and state income taxes and the Social Security payroll tax. I estimate that an increase in marginal tax rates reduces GDP, particularly in the next year. When one factors in the typical relationship between tax rates and tax revenue, the multiplier is around minus 1.1. Hence, an increase in taxes by $300 billion lowers GDP the next year by about $330 billion.

Christina Romer, the chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, and her husband, David, have been major contributors to research on tax multipliers. Their results, which rely on the history of U.S. tax legislation since 1945, show tax multipliers of larger magnitude than the one I found. (So my conclusions here—based on the coming increases in taxes—would be strengthened if I switched to their estimates.) By contrast, I have not seen serious scientific research by Ms. Romer on spending multipliers, so I cannot understand her rationale for assuming values well above one, as she has apparently done when evaluating the fiscal stimulus plan. If the spending multiplier were really larger than one, it would mean that GDP would rise by even more than the rise in government spending.

My estimates allow me to assess the 2009-10 fiscal-stimulus package, which I characterize as roughly $300 billion of added government purchases in each of 2009 and 2010. I assume that, as of 2011, government spending goes back down to its 2008 level, although I could assume—perhaps more realistically—that the added spending is permanent.

I suppose that taxes do not change in 2009-10, so that the incremental spending is deficit-financed. The spending multipliers that come from my research imply that GDP rises by $120 billion (or 0.8% of GDP) in 2009 and $180 billion (or 1.2% of GDP in 2010)—all compared to the baseline of no stimulus package. These results imply that other parts of GDP fall by $180 billion in 2009 and $120 billion in 2010.

In other words, the deal looks pretty good in the short run because we ""buy"" the added government outlays by paying 60 cents on the dollar in 2009 (losing 180 in private spending to get 300 in government spending) and 40 cents on the dollar in 2010.

How attractive this short-run deal looks depends on how much one values the added governmental activity. If it's considered useful public investment—such as building a needed highway or, more modestly, fixing potholes—it might look good. If it's wasteful spending in a hastily constructed and highly political stimulus package, it looks bad.

But these calculations are not nearly the end of the story, because the added $600 billion of government spending leads to a correspondingly larger public debt. These added obligations must be paid for sometime by raising taxes (unless future government spending declines below its 2008 level, an unlikely scenario).

I suppose that the government collects an additional $300 billion of taxes in each of 2011 and 2012. The timing of the future taxes does not matter for the main calculations—the key point is that the government has no free lunch and must collect the extra taxes eventually. Since I assume a tax multiplier of minus 1.1, applying with a one-year lag, the higher taxes reduce GDP by $330 billion in each of 2012 and 2013.

We can now put the elements together to form a ""five-year plan"" from 2009 to 2013. The path of incremental government outlays over the five years in billions of dollars is +300, +300, 0, 0, 0, which adds up to +600. The path for GDP is +120, +180, +60, minus 330, minus 330, adding up to minus 300. GDP falls overall because the famous ""balanced-budget multiplier""—the response of GDP when government spending and taxes rise together—is negative. This result accords with the familiar pattern whereby countries with larger public sectors tend to grow slower over the long term.

The projected effect on other parts of GDP (consumer expenditure, private investment, net exports) is minus 180, minus 120, +60, minus 330, minus 330, which adds up to minus 900. Thus, viewed over five years, the fiscal stimulus package is a way to get an extra $600 billion of public spending at the cost of $900 billion in private expenditure. This is a bad deal.

The fiscal stimulus package of 2009 was a mistake. It follows that an additional stimulus package in 2010 would be another mistake.

      motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction]; //motor's next sequence based on controllerCS's next 'Direction'

    //TODO: this is where the problem occurs. 'controllerCS -&gt; Direction' doesn't get fed into 'motorCS -&gt; Next[index]' as an index.

    // in fact, I don't know what it does at all. I think it just laughs at me for not getting the level of indirection right.
     }

Since *controllerCS -&gt; Direction* is a pointer to an address I think that I am accidentally passing the address to *motorCS -&gt; Next* but I am not sure.


**Here's the motorState FSM:**

    unsigned char BtnInput;   /* holds initial port input from buttons. used to index 'Next' in controllerFSM */

    /* states for the stepper movement */

    const struct motorState
    {
      unsigned char Out;      /* Output to Port H */
      const struct motorState *Next[3];
    };

    typedef const struct motorState motorStateType;
    typedef motorStateType *    motorStatePtr;
    motorStatePtr motorCS;  /* Current motorState */

    #define S5  &amp;FSM[0]
    #define S6  &amp;FSM[1]
    #define S10 &amp;FSM[2]
    #define S9  &amp;FSM[3]

    motorStateType FSM[4] = 
    {
      {0x05,{S6,S9,S5}},
      {0x06,{S10,S5,S6}},
      {0x0A,{S9,S6,S10}},
      {0x09,{S5,S10,S9}}
    };

**Here's the controllerState FSM:**

    const struct controllerState
    {
      unsigned char Direction;            // Output to Port T
      unsigned short Time;          // Time in msec to wait in this state
      const struct controllerState *Next[16];  // Next state if input=0,1,2,3
    };

    typedef const struct controllerState ctrlStateType;
    typedef ctrlStateType *    ctrlStatePtr;
    ctrlStatePtr controllerCS;  /* Current State */



    ctrlStateType controllerFSM[10] =
    {
    /*0:Rest*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*1:Fore*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}},
    /*2:Back*/  {direction,time,{nextstates}}

     };


Please let me know if I should comment some more, I never know how much to write in my comments.

Edit: removed most of the preprocessor directives for readability.

In case you are going to say '*next[]' never gets initialised, it does.

*Next[3] actually works; if I write
    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[0];

for example, the motor steps forward just fine.
The problem is when I try to retrieve the index from the controller's FSM by saying

    motorCS = motorCS -&gt; Next[controllerCS -&gt; Direction];",technology,2010-02-23,-0.210630711358674

Better But Still Far From What's Needed","Summary:
Covered: 31 Uninsured Americans
Mandate: Exempted below tax filing threshold or if cost &gt; 8% of income
Greater fines than Senate version
Insurance Reforms: No denial for preexisting conditions or discrimination
Federal Government authority to block rate hikes, roll back premiums and force insurance companies to give rebates
Medicaid: Coverage to 133 percent of the federal poverty level
Taxes: Obama scaled back a tax on high-cost insurance plans
Prescription Drugs: Closed Medicare prescription gap
Subsidies: Available up to a family of 4 with a $88,000 income

But the Health Insurance Cartel is still intact and rates are regulated by the Government that is likely to be sympathetic to Insurers.

gaming,"I think NVIDA killed my GPU, anyone have a good suggestion for the best performance per dollar ATI card?","I was using the 196.75 driver up until yesterday when I rolled back to 196.21. I have a BFG 9800GT that I bought a little over a year ago and within the last week I've started to have some major problems. The card still works, sort of, but after playing a game for anywhere between 10min to an hour I start experiencing severe graphic corruption. 

After hearing about NVIDA recycling old GPUs in new cards and now the problems with the latest drivers I'm pretty well fed up with them. Many years ago I stopped using ATI cards because they had what I considered to be some of the worst quality video cards and drivers. As a consumer I have a pretty long memory when it comes to being burned by a company, but in light of what NVIDA has been doing I'm willing to give ATI another chance.

I haven't really kept up on the latest news in terms of video card performance and reviews in some time. That and I never really paid much attention to ATI products to begin with, so I really don't understand what the model numbers they use for their cards mean and what the latest cards are. Can the reddit community please help me find a new card to replace my 9800GT? I don't have a whole lot of money to spend, I think about $200 would be my limit. I would be satisfied with a lateral transition to an ATI card with similar performance, but a performance upgrade would be nice and something I would consider paying more for if the price/performance value is significant.",technology,2010-03-05,-0.1521268870839989

Economics,Simple example to illustrate how we got here.,"I've seen several videos posted on reddit trying to explain the fractional reserve system, and on how the ""everyone's in debt"" situation arises.  I have a few thought experiments I wanted to try out, and see if they will take me in the right direction.

Let's assume that in a fictional community, there are $1000 in circulation.  Let's say that all of them are deposited.  Reserve rate at 10%.  Now, all the money is loaned and returned, ad infinitum, which should mean there are now $1000/(1-.9) = $10,000 in loans out there, and yet the bank holds all the money, so there is no way to pay any of it back.  This is bad, obviously, but that's the degenerate case.

Now let's say there are $2000 in the community, but again only $1000 are deposited and multiplied by FR.  Let's say interest rates are 10% yearly.  That means that every year, 10% of $10,000, or $1000, must be paid back.  Since there are only $1000 left in the economy that are not in the bank, this means that after 1 year, bad things start happening.

Is this the right way to think about this?  What would be the next step or steps?  One question that sticks out to me, is is there an equation (really an inequality) that relates the fractional reserve rate, the interest rate, and the fraction of money that is NOT in the bank, which must be fulfilled to avoid/cause the runaway debt situation we are in now?",finance,2010-03-07,-0.0885571160274958

gaming,Battlefield Bad Company 2 thoughts,"I have been playing BFBC2 for the last few days and I find it a lot more fun (than MW2), both the single player campaign and the multiplayer.

Aside from all the connectivity problems at EA, the multiplayer experience is good. I wish they offered the server software for download, so I could run it myself but oh well.

The best fun I had last night was knifing snipers. A sniper killed me about 15 times at the spawn, until I figured out where he was, I tried to snipe him but my skills are not so good at that, so I just snuck around the map to where he was hiding, and knifed him. I ran away, hid in some bushes, and he came back, with another Recon friend. So, I knifed them both. I hid again, and this time he came looking for me, so I knifed him one more time.

He stopped sniping the spawn. :D

BFBC2 seems a lot more tactical than MW2. With the larger maps, there is more to do, and its more concentrated on objectives, where MW2 seems concentrated on twitchy gameplay.

For me, I'm not really a hardcode FPSer, but I do love the genre very much and spend many hours every week playing L4D2, CS:S, and other games of it's ilk, and I'm really enjoying BFBC2.

How is everyone else finding it?

politics,How can we justify bailing out automobile makers and not our nations schools?,"I was just reading another post about another cash strapped state closing down half of its schools, and knowing that there are shortages in a lot of programs at my former (and my sons current) school I just have to wonder how they can justify bailing out automobile makers and not our schools?  I think its pretty well known that having a well educated population is crucial to the success of a nation.  Thomas Jefferson even said “Whenever the people are well-informed, they can be trusted with their own government; whenever things get so far wrong as to attract their notice, they may be relied on to set them to rights.”  

I can't think of any better way to fall further behind international testing, and also of giving way to a more feeble-minded (perhaps more easily controlled?) populace.  Im not actually suggesting a conscious link between the budget problems of our current schools and a desire to create a more easily manipulated populace, but honestly, can anyone explain to me how this isn't a top priority in our government right along with health care?  From what I have heard Obama has or is soon to announce an extra 4.35 billion in federal funding for public schools, but from what I understand that doesn't even begin to address the problem.  Im honestly curious about what peoples opinions of this is, perhaps there is some element im missing, but how can this even come close to being justified?  I guess if nothing else it drives up recruitment for a depleted military.  But wouldn't they rather have less higher quality (better educated) soldiers than a mass of slow thinking louts?  Im trying to look at this logically, but I just don't see the sense.",cryptocurrency,2010-03-11,-0.04262003952369

science,"Some history about aspartame, how safe is it really?","Let us look at one the common chemicals being used by millions of Americans, aspartame. When heated to 86 degrees Fahrenheit (human body ~ 98.6) – aspartame releases free methanol that breaks down into formic acid and formaldehyde in the body. One quart of aspartame-added beverage contains about 56 mg of methanol.

Dr.Louis J Elsas explained to the US senate committee on labor and human resources: ” I am a pediatrician, a professor of pediatrics at Emory, and have spent 25 years in the biomedical sciences, trying to prevent mental retardation and birth defects caused by excess phenylalanine..[I] have considerable concern for the increased dissemination and consumption of the sweetener aspartame – 1-methyl N-L-a-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine – in our world food supply. This artificial dipeptide is hydrolyzed by the intestinal tract to produce L-phenylalanine, which in excess is a known neurotoxin.” Countering claims that lab tests indicated little harm from small amounts of aspartame, Dr Elsas noted, “Normal humans do not metabolize phenylalanine as efficiently as do lower species, such as rodents, and thus most of the previous studies in aspartame effects on rats are irrelevant to eh question.”

Before 1980 the FDA had refused to approve the use of aspartame. FDA toxicologist Dr. Adrian Gross testified to congress that aspartame caused tumors and brain cancer in lab animals and therefore violated the Delaney Amendment that forbids putting anything in food that is know to cause cancer. Aspartame also is blamed for the increase in diabetes as it not only can precipitate the disease but also stimulates and aggravates diabetic retinopathy and neuropathy, which, when interacting with insulin, can cause diabetics to go into convulsions.

Dr. Betty Martini worked in the medical field for 22 years. She was the founder of Mission Possible International, working with doctors around the world in an effort to remove aspartame from food, drinks, and medicine ). She gave this account of how pharmaceutical interests overcame claims of public welfare:

” Donald Rumsfeld was CEO of Searle, the conglomerate that manufactured aspartame. For 16 years the FDA refused to approve it, not only because it’s unsafe, but also because they wanted the company indicted for fraud. US prosecutors hired on the defense team were Sam Skinner and William Conlon. Skinner went on to become secretary of transportation, squelching cries of the pilots having seizures on this seizure-triggering drug, aspartame, and then chief of staff under G.H.W.Bush. Some of these people reached high places. Even supreme court justice Thomas Clarence is a former Monsanto attorney (Monsanto bought Searle in 1985 and sold it a few years ago.). When John Ashcroft became attorneys general in 2001, Larry Thompson from King and Spalding Attorneys (another former Monsanto attorney) became deputy under Ashcroft. However the FDA still refused to allow Nutrasweet (aspartame) on the market. It is a deadly neurotoxic drug masquerading as an additive. It interacts with all antidepressants, L-dopa, Coumadin, hormones, insulin, all cardiac medication, and many others. It also is a chemical hyper-sensitization drug, so it interacts with vaccines, other toxins, other unsafe sweeteners, like Splenda that has a chlorinated base (like DDT) and can cause autoimmune disease. It has a synergistic and additive effect with MSG. Both being excitotoxins, the aspartic acid in aspartame, and MSG, the glutamate. The FDA has known this for a quarter of a century and done nothing even though it’s against the law. Searle went on to build a NutraSweet factory and had $9 million worth of inventory. Donald Rumsfeld was on Pres. Reagan’s transition team and the day after Reagan took office he appointed and FDA commissioner who would approve aspartame.”

Searle salesperson Patty Wood-Allott claimed that in 1981 Rumsfeld told company employees ‘he would call in all his markers and that no matter what, he would see to it that aspartame be approved this year.”

Dr.Martinni noted: “The FDA set up a board of inquiry of the best scientists they had to offer, who said aspartame is not safe and causes brain tumors, and the petition for approval is hereby revoked. The new FDA commissioner, Arthur Hull Hayes, overruled that board of inquiry and then went on to work for the PR agency of the manufacturer, Burson-Marstellar, rumored at $1,000 a day, and has refused to talk to the press since. There were three congressional hearings because of the outcry of the people being poisoned. Senator Orrin Hatch refused to allow hearings for a long time. The first hearing was in 1985, and Senator Hatch and others were paid by Monsanto. So the bill by Senator [Howard] Metzenbaum never got out of the committee. This bill would have put a moratorium on aspartame, and had the NIH do independent studies on the problems being seen in the population, interaction with drugs, seizures, problems with pregnancy, and even behavioral problems in children. This is due to the depletion of serotonin caused by the phenylalanine in aspartame.”

Reagan’s FDA commissioner Hayes initially approved aspartame only as a powdered additive. But in 1983, just before he left his position, he approved the additive for all carbonated beverages.

Attempting to study or report on aspartame is a thankless task for mainstream academics. Dr. Janet Starr Hull, an OSHA-certified environmental hazardous-waste emergency-response specialist and toxicologist, in 1991 was diagnosed with Graves’ disease ( a defect in the immunization system that leads to hyperthyroidism) only to learn through her own research she had been poisoned by aspartame. She stated, “Many scientists at prestigious American universities will tell you they cannot get grants for continued research on aspartame or Splenda, or their department heads have been told to drop all discussion on the topic. Some say aspartame research isn’t worth the effort because they cannot get published in America scientific journals. Others claim research centers constructed by the large corporations, such as Duke University’s Searle Research Center, were designed with manages research as a construction proviso.”

Illustrating the battle between experts in regard to aspartame was the 2005 research by Dr. Morando Soffritti, scientific director of the European Ramazzini Foundation of Oncology and Environmental Sciences in Bologna, Italy. Soffritti conducted a three year study on 1,800 rats and concluded that aspartame is a mulipotential carcinogen. His work was peer-reviewed by seven world experts, and in April 2007, Dr. Soffritti received the third Irving J Selikoff Award from the Mount Sinai School of medicine in New York City, where he presented a more recent study that confirmed the cancer causing potential of aspartame at even small doses. He noted that only a small amount of aspartame can trigger cancer, and babies of mothers who ingested aspartame could grow up to contract cancer. Other studies conducted in Spain, such as the “Barcelona Report” by the staff of the biology department of the University of Barcelona, confirmed that aspartame transformed into formaldehyde in the bodies of living laboratory specimens and spread throughout vital organs. These studies, largely unreported in the US media, confirmed aspartame’s carcinogenicity in lab rats.

In 2006, media reports spoke of a ‘new study’ that counted Soffritti’s research. This study was not new. It was actually conducted in the mid 1990s and reported that researchers could find no link between aspartame and cancer, according to Unhee Lim, PhD, a researcher at the National Institute of Health (NIH). Lim and colleagues worked with 473,984 men and women between the ages of 50 &amp; 71 who participated in this diet-and-health study. In 1995 and 1996, participants were asked how much they drank of three popular diet beverages – soda, fruit drinks, and tea. They were also asked in they added aspartame to their coffee or tea. From the answers, the researchers calculated how much aspartame they consumed on a daily basis. During the next 5 years 1,972 of those studied developed lymphoma or leukemia, and 364 developed brain tumors. When the researchers looked at people who consumed an average of at least 400mg of aspartame a day (about 2 cans of soda) they found no link between consumption and cancer.

Critics noted that this study was subject to ‘recall bias,’ since those in the study were being asked to remember what and how much they drank, “If their recollections weren’t accurate, it compromises the findings,” said Michael F Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer watchdog organization. There was also no consideration of the many other foods and additives that contained aspartame, which added to the daily intake. Yet, the few corporation mass media outlets that carried the story in 2006 introduced the ten-year old study with headlines such as “Findings May Help to Alleviate Concerns Raised by Rat Study Last Year.”

Why such aversion by the media to dealing with controversial health issues? According to the center for public integrity (CPI), in the past 7 years the pharmaceutical and health-products industry spend in excess of $800 million to lobby legislators and government officials at both the federal and state levels. Manufactures of pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and other health products spent nearly $182 million on federal lobbying from January 2005 through June 2006. “No other industry has spend more money to sway public policy,” stated a 2005 CPI special report titled “drug Lobby Second to None.” Its combined political outlays on lobbying and campaign contributions is topped only by the insurance industry.”",technology,2010-03-14,-0.0922793109032948

Economics,Paul Krugman Versus Reality,"In his latest weekly New York Times column, Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman put forward arguments that were so nonsensical that the award committee should ask for its medal back. 

Recent rhetoric from Washington has put the economic relationship between the U.S. and China squarely on the front burner, and Krugman is demanding that we crank up the flame. This week 130 members of Congress sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner demanding that the Obama administration designate China as a ""currency manipulator"". Following that, a bipartisan group of senators introduced a bill that looks to force the Obama administration's hand. For its own part, Beijing invites criticism by continuing to deny its utterly obvious currency agenda. 

As these tensions escalate, most economists urge Washington to tread lightly because of the negative fallout for America if China were to begin selling its enormous cache of U.S. Treasury bonds. Krugman pushes back, asserting that the U.S. risks little by playing hardball, and that China has more to lose. He asserts that a Chinese decision to end its purchases of U.S. Treasury debt would make only a marginal impact on long-term interest rates. Did you hear that Stockholm? 

According to Krugman, our secret weapon of economic invincibility is the Fed's ability to print dollars endlessly. If China were to foolishly decide to attack us by selling our debt, the Fed could simply step in and buy the excess with newly printed greenbacks. (In other words, Krugman sees no difference between funding the debt and monetizing it. See my latest video blog on the subject.). For Krugman, China would gain little from such an attack, but would lose the ability to export to its best customer and suffer severe losses in the value of its dollar holdings. Krugman's worldview is reassuring - but it has absolutely nothing to do with reality. 

There is a huge difference between selling your debt to another and ""selling"" it to yourself. When China buys our debt, it uses its own savings. In order to purchase a trillion dollars of U.S. Treasuries, the Fed would have to expand our money supply by a corresponding amount. Even Krugman acknowledges that this would cause the dollar to lose value; however, he feels that a weaker dollar is good for America and bad for China. 

Krugman does not believe that a tanking dollar will translate into higher interest rates or higher consumer prices at home. No matter how many dollars the Fed creates, or how much value those dollars lose relative to other currencies, he is confident that as long as unemployment remains high, rates will stay low and inflation will remain under control. This is absurd. 

If the dollar were to nosedive, the Fed would normally look to protect the currency by raising interest rates, thereby increasing foreign demand for the currency. But with an economy currently on crutches, the Fed will ignore a weakening dollar and continue to try to boost employment with near-zero rates. 

But keeping the Fed Funds rate low only holds rates down for U.S. government debt. If the dollar weakens substantially, other rates offered to other borrowers will rise as investors demand greater returns to compensate for inflation. To keep rates low for homeowners, credit card borrowers, corporations, municipalities, and state governments, the Fed would be forced to buy, or guarantee, all forms of dollar-denominated debt. The Fed would become the lender of only resort. 

Once the Fed shows that its commitment to low rates is limitless (the value of the dollar be damned), private creditors will quit the game. Even average Americans would hit the Fed's bid. It would be a race for the exits, with no one wanting to be left holding a bag of worthless paper dollars. 

Most economists, Krugman included, see cheap money as a panacea for all ills. And while it's true that a falling dollar, by lowering the real value of U.S. wages, would help make U.S. goods more competitive, it would also lead to skyrocketing consumer prices, rapidly rising interest rates, and a collapse in American living standards. Make no mistake: this is the end game of Krugman's ""get tough on China"" policy. 

This apocalyptic scenario can only be avoided if Washington jealously guards the status quo, avoiding confrontation with China at all costs. Yet, even that is an outcome that no one can rationally expect. Given exploding U.S. government deficits and the inability of U.S. citizens and corporations to repair their balance sheets, the United States faces financing needs that even China's gargantuan savings stockpile will be unable to cover. 

Krugman is right about one thing - China's currency peg is destabilizing the global economy and must end. But he fails utterly to understand the implications for the U.S. and China. If China were to reverse its role in the U.S. Treasury market, both economies would be destabilized in the short-term. But in the medium- and long-term, China would clearly emerge as the winner. 

Absent Treasury-bond purchases, the value of the Chinese currency would rise sharply, causing goods prices to tumble in China. This long-delayed increase in purchasing power for everyday Chinese will unleash pent-up demand in what is already the largest middle class in the world. Chinese factories would retool in order to produce goods for their own citizens to consume. In RMB terms, commodity prices would plunge, making it easier for China to produce all kinds of stuff, such as automobiles, while also making it cheaper for the Chinese to buy gas. Millions will trade in bikes for cars, and Chinese oil imports will swell. 

The opposite would occur in America, where an artificial, consumer-based economy, supported by Chinese lending, will come tumbling down. Without the ability to import cheap goods from overseas, Americans will pay more and get less. While gas and food become cheaper for the Chinese, they will simultaneously become much more expensive for Americans - so too will automobiles, consumer electronics, furniture, and just about every other product we want or need (even those few we still make ourselves). 

Washington's best option is to recognize that the current relationship is unsustainable and to plan, as best as possible, for a more viable future. We Americans also must be honest with ourselves and recognize that we have been living beyond our means and that our lifestyle has been largely financed by austerity in China. We must conceive of a plan that weans us from this dependence without provoking China to pull the rug out from under us before we have a firm footing. To construct a policy around Krugman's ridiculous assumption that we benefit China more than they benefit us is to invite catastrophe on an unimaginable scale.",finance,2010-03-19,-0.1059393091231892

science,"[question] What does it feel like to experience a ""crest in space-time""?","For example:

Consider the Sun just vanishing. Poof. No qualms and ignoring other parameters except that of general relativity, no problems pre-8 something minutes. The shitty visualisations of GR spoon-fed to us by popular science shows and shitty science popularisers like Michio Kaku tells us that if the Sun were to suddenly disappear, it would give off a ripple in the fabric of space-time (Although I assume that this is indeed a consequence of GR, it's just IMAO bullshit to consider those ball-trampoline models because of the implication of a kind of meta-gravity. I think it's a bit more accurate to model space-time in a sort of medium in which we are fully immersed or a fluid, however equally shitty.)

Now here's the really fun part, since a ripple is a kind of wave, and every wave oscillates, space-time would have to oscillate if it were to host ripples. But what really happens when we hit a crest in the ripple? Do we sort of fly away from the original position of the sun and be pulled back when we hit again a trough? Or is it more of a nicer picture if we consider a wave of only negatives, thus eliminating the need for oscillations?

tl;dr: What happens at the top of a ripple kind of curve in space-time? Antigravitation?

Also, I propose the acceptance of a new guideline pertaining to putting [question] in the title of a question post here in /r/science. You know, to indicate a question like those TOMT guys.",technology,2010-03-20,-0.0389819735440317

politics,A new Monitary Reform Act. Like the greenbacks of Lincoln's time. Why would this be / not be a great way to relief our national crisis?,"Monetary Reform Act – A Summary
(in four paragraphs)

This proposed law would require banks to increase their reserves on deposits from the current 10%, to 100%, over a one-year period. This would abolish fractional reserve banking (i.e., money creation by private banks) which depends upon fractional (i.e., partial) reserve lending. To provide the funds for this reserve increase, the US Treasury Department would be authorized to issue new United States Notes (and/or US Note accounts) sufficient in quantity to pay off the entire national debt (and replace all Federal Reserve Notes).

The funds required to pay off the national debt are always closely equivalent to the amount of money the banks have created by engaging in fractional lending because the Fed creates 10% of the money the government needs to finance deficit spending (and uses that newly created money to buy US bonds on the open market), then the banks create the other 90% as loans. Thus the national debt closely tracks the combined total of US Treasury debt held by the Fed (10%) and the amount of money created by private banks (90%).

Because this two-part action (increasing bank reserves to 100% and paying off the entire national debt) adds no net increase to the money supply (the two actions cancel each other in net effect on the money supply), it would cause neither inflation nor deflation, but would result in monetary stability and the end of the boom-bust pattern of US economic activity caused by our current, inherently unstable system.

Thus our entire national debt would be extinguished – thereby dramatically reducing or entirely eliminating the US budget deficit and the need for taxes to pay the $400+ billion interest per year on the national debt – and our economic system would be stabilized, while ending the terrible injustice of private banks being allowed to create over 90% of our money as loans on which they charge us interest. Wealth would cease to be concentrated in fewer and fewer hands as a result of private bank money creation. Thereafter, apart from a regular 3% annual increase (roughly matching population growth), only Congress would have the power to authorize changes in the US money supply – for public use -not private banks increasing only private bankers’ wealth.",finance,2010-03-20,0.0474000903137018

I have based most of my arguments on the breakdown in the ask reddit thread. 

Here is a transcript of our conversation - the points I am attempting to contend are mainly in the last response.


Mary
&gt;It's not a bad thing.... The methods they are using to GET it however are... You will be FORCED to take it or be fined or jailed. We will have to start paying for it now even tho it will not go into effect yrs from now. Illegals are ""entitled"" to it. We have to pay for people to have it whether they have jobs or not... A step towards socialism. My ... See Morepaycheck will be supporting not only those who truly are in desparate need, but those lazy bums who also think we should pay for them to have houses and vehicles. It'll be one more tax burden that the working class really just can't afford but are being forced to choke up. Not sure what the latest bill says, but the first one said that you would NOT have a choice of which provider or doctor to go to. Also it said that all docotors would be paid the same.... Sorry but I want my say brain surgeon to get paid more and have high tech equipment more than say, my foot doctor. Insurance companies will be forced to close.... Job loss. Like I said, I don't know what the new bill says, hopefully it is a little less scary than the one I read.

&gt;Oh yes, did I mention that Obama and congress are EXEMPT from this yet we HAVE to take it? That ought tell you something right there! What kind of leader is it that will not lead by example? Or will not be willing to do what he wants everybody else to do?!


Teresa Enyart
&gt;Right Mary.. and those of us who have insurance policies paid for by our employers as a benefit will be taxed and as a result these companies will most likely opt to let their employees pay for their own insurance which is now manditory for you to have.Also those of us who have what is deemed to be a""Cadillac Plan"" will be taxed to the tune of 40%. This whole bill is outside of the scope of the Constitution. I do believe that health &gt;care should be availible to everyone but not controlled by the government or forced on us. Don't be fooled into thinking that this so called ""Victory"" is for your benifit. Otherwise the Pres. himself and all of our elected officials would be covered by this same policy. They are above their own law on this issue.


AC
&gt;Please Mary can you cite any of these points in the Bill?

&gt;For a succinct breakdown of the health care bill and how it will effect ALL of us please read here.
http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319

&gt;You will find that it says nothing about increasing tax or income tax or whatever you are referring to with ""My Paycheck"", unless of course you earn over $200,000 per year (250,000 as a couple), then the bill will raise your medicare contribution to 2.35 percent from 1.45 percent (+0.9%).

&gt;Oh, and please stop watching faux news.


Teresa
&gt;AC ....some small businesses fall into that catagory....view this bill less narrowly.

AC
&gt;Teresa, indeed you are correct, however, the bill also includes a tax credit for small business owners to of-set the medicare contribution tax increase. The Small business tax cut actually goes into effect this year, while the increase in medicare tax does not take place until 2013.

&gt;Citation: http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1914020220100319

&gt;Also, there are bound to be a very few people who still get hit a little bit by this bill, however i highly doubt it will put anyone out of business. If it means that pre-existing conditions are gone, i am ALL for it. 

&gt;before this insurance company's had no incentive to give a rats ass about the health of their customers, they can refuse care or not cover people based on a number of loopholes. Pre-existing conditions being the major one. This is how they lowered there bottom line. Now they can no longer kick out sick people, they will have to actually make people healthy if they want to lower costs, isn't this what we want, healthy people?

&gt;What ever happened to the golden-rule.


Teresa
&gt;Oh and by the way....docs.house.gov/edlabor/AAHCA-BillText-071409.pdf is a better choice for reading the bill than using a website like Reuters or any others for that matter. Most people are smart enough to figure these bills out for themselves and not have to rely on Fox (far right) or Reuters (far left).


AC
&gt;I believe you overestimate the intelligence and the ""free time"" of the average American citizen.

&gt;Please cite anywhere in the bill that contradicts anything I have said.


Mary
&gt;Like I said, I haven't read the new bill, and not sure what changes they have made and what all they have kept. I will see if I retained a copy of the original... However...
""What Supporters of ObamaCare Will Tell You

&gt;The proponents of expansive federal power hang their hat on the ""Commerce Clause"" of the constitution (Article 1, Section 8, Clause 3) for Congress's authority to mandate health care insurance for citizens. Supporters of the federal individual mandate argue that, under its power to ""regulate commerce...among the several states,"" Congress may regulate the doing of nothing at all. In other words, because Congress has the power to regulate business between the states, it must have the authority to demand it from individuals. If this mandate is allowed to stand, it would be the first use of the Commerce Clause to universally mandate an activity by all citizens of .the United States.

&gt;The most common argument used to justify a federal mandate to purchase health insurance is the talking point that states are allowed to force individuals to buy car insurance before they are allowed to drive. However, there is a fundamental constitutional difference between the inherent police powers of the states and the enumerated powers of the national government—not to mention that driving is a voluntary activity. You don't have to have auto insurance if you don't drive a car or don’t drive on state roads, and states require drivers to maintain auto insurance only to cover injuries to others—not themselves like an individual mandate would do. The analogy between a state mandating auto insurance for those who drive and mandatory health insurance for all is flawed at best.""

gaming,A hilarious/cruel rendering of Final Fantasy IV (DS),"As my little band of characters trudged through the desert, eventually happening upon the rubble that was once Damycan, I began to notice certain..peculiarities.  This is one cruel game.  After poking a few dead bodies (admittedly for the odd potion or Gil), I actually happened upon a live one.  His last wish?  To be dragged upstairs to some magical chamber that would heal him.  What did my band of ""heroes"" do?  They left the poor bastard to rot, rummaging through the sparsely furnished remains of the castle.  The first sign of emotion didn't come until I stumbled over the remains of that Anna chick.  Tellah, being such a caring father, decided to spend the remaining moments of his daughter's life slapping her boyfriend around for a whopping 8 hp.  Using the last of her waning life, which probably would've preserved her enough for a quick trip to Kaipo for some soup and healing, she yelled at them to stop and expressed her love for Edward, and simultaneously outed him as the prince of what was now a heap of rubble with two citizens huddling over a ""magic pot""...

Oh Edward...My oh-so-useful future party member.  I'll get to him later.  

Once Anna croaked, Edward did as any normal man would do after losing his love.  He began to grieve.  Cecil, Tellah, and Rydia did as any normal companions would do, quietly understanding and giving him time to cope.  Wait, no they didn't.  Rydia told him to man-up, Cecil slapped him in the mouth, and Tellah told him his tears were worthless before bounding out of my party with not so much as a good-bye.  Little did that old bastard know, I took his Silver Armlet, Staff..hell I took everything that wasn't glued to his body, including the feathered cap.  I doubt he noticed, hobbling through the desert in his underwear.  I mean, we are talking about a man whose most powerful magical spell is something called ""recall"", rendering him about as powerful as an Alzheimer's patient with the ability to shoot fire from his hands.  

Things got stranger at this point.  While dragging Edward through his fallen kingdom, looting what little remained and stepping over the corpses of what I imagine were friends and family members, I happened across two poor souls unlucky enough to survive the Baron bombing.  They were huddled around an HP-replenishment pot, talking about how they were short on supplies, and would soon depart on a hovercraft.  I said my goodbyes, scanned the perimeter of the courtyard, and found a few more gems for my journey and some poor bastard crying about his burnt-out eyes.  At this point, I carried Edward and Rydia through the land adjacent to the Damycan castlegrounds, laughing merrily as sandworms and goblins beat the absolute shit out of poor Prince Edward.  At level 10, he was dwarfed by my other two party-members, each sporting levels of 20 and 18.  Just when he could take no more, collapsing into the blistering crystals of the sand, I would drag poor Edward back through his fallen castle, over the dead friends and relatives, up the steps to the spot where his beloved died, and forced him to drink from a couple of dusty pots.  I know the japanese are big on persevering, but this..this was just fucking mean.

When I felt he was strong enough to be my gopher for the Antlion's sand pearl, I hopped into the hovercraft the two old folks inside the castle told me about.  Their mistake I guess.  I do wonder how long they survived once the food rations ran out, huddled around the magical pot to replenish their hp when the starvation debuff kicked in.  I imagine it was a prolonged death, filled with the torturous pains of starvation and the belligerent human will to survive.  I frowned.

Onward to the Antlion's cave we floated.  Thankfully, the ocean's of Final Fantasy's fourth world are filled with rocks.  This must suck for boats, but for hovercraft, it's a charm.  We bumbled and bounded our way to the cave, stormed in, and helped ourselves to all sorts of treasure.  Each piece conveniently tucked in a treasure chest, unlocked, and waiting for our prying hands.  I'm not sure of the original owners, but I would wager them to be the poor goblin family's that we slaughtered in our haste, or perhaps those unusual yellow jellies with the perpetually pissed-off facial expressions.  Nevertheless, looting and hunting, we made our way to the bowels of the cave.  Cecil tightly gripping his sword, plunging into foe after foe, and sweet little Rydia, raising her Ice Rod into the air and pelting enemies with ice cubes.  I'm not sure what Edward was doing.  He would pluck carelessly at his harp, confusing both me and the enemies.  The damage from his sound waves did as much as you would expect (i.e. nothing), and in time, we found the den of the mother Antlion. 

It was at this point we learned the horrible secret.  Sand pearls are the vaginal discharge that seeps out during her birthing period.  So, I guess you could say we were pearl diving...heh.  The most alarming realization, however, occurred to me when I thought of Rosa.  Would this be an oral medication?  Would she be forced to choose between life or swallowing the douchey-globulet of some cave beast?  I had little time to think about this, however, as Edward must've slipped and crushed one of her eggs.  Slinging the goo from his velvet slippers (I presume), we jumped back in horror as some wide-eyed beast erupted from the ground.  Terrified, we assumed our positions.

Cecil called upon his inner emo, Rydia readied her wand, and Edward...Edward played the fucking harp.  If we were going to be eaten alive in the musky den of some monstrous creature, at least we would do it with a nice soundtrack.  Call it intuition, or the little blue bar at the top of the screen..whatever, but something told the little party not to attack her with magic whilst her eyes were crimson with fury.  It was during this period that Cecil slashed away, Rydia readied herself against the physical onslaught, and Edward...again with the Goddamned harp.  In time, her eyes lost their red glow, and Rydia began to call upon the elements, first a crash of lightning, and then more ice cubes.  Thoroughly pissed off by being shocked and made uncomfortably cold, the Antlion eventually died and promptly dissolved into yellow orbs.  There was much cheering, and with great haste, we ran for the entrance, slicing through the remaining denizens of the cave.  I felt bad for any future recipient of Desert Fever, as this poor Antlion would not be providing any future medication for them.  I highly doubted her offspring would survive long either, hatching into a motherless world filled with murderous blobs of jelly, pissed-off turtles, and so forth..  It sounded, according to Edward, as if more Antlions existed, but I saw only one cave...and it was stained red with the blood of our...adventures.

Back in Kaipo after a quick hovercraft ride, I administered the disgusting ""medicine"" to Rosa.  Despite having challenged death and the desert, disregarding the official word of Baron's king, and expressing her love for Cecil upon waking..my hero's first words to her were ""So..about this Golbez guy?"" to which she blamed for the King's douchebag behavior.  Still coughing from what I assume to be the taste of Antlion vagina, she forced her way into my party and we fell into a deep slumber.  I don't remember asking the owners of the cabin if we could spend the night, but who is going to argue with a fully-armored knight who emits purple flames and wields something called a ""Shadowblade""?  Not to mention the last time the green-haired girl got pissed, a giant popped up out of nowhere, said ""Hay."", and split the world into two pieces.

While the rest slept, Edward went outside and began hallucinating about Anna and some reptilian creature in a fashionable cloak.  His response was predictable.  He played the fucking harp again.

When morning came, I bought/sold items until they were in factors of five, set up my party, and put Rosa in the back despite her longing to be next to Cecil.  I can only imagine what other terrors my ""heroes"" will wreak in the next chapter of this horrific adventure...

Economics,What can be done to fix the ratings agencies?,"I've read both Fool's Gold by Gillian Tett, and The Big Short by Michael Lewis. One thing that both books make very apparent is the toothlessness of Moody's, S&amp;P, et al in rating the CDOs which caused such havoc. Specifically, it was a common practice for the big firms to package the triple B tranche of mortgage bonds into a CDO, which the ratings agencies would rate as triple A on the basis that it was diversified enough. Much of the market accepted the triple A on these and acted accordingly, thus creating the crazy exposure that blew up.

The ratings agencies appear to have encountered two major difficulties: 1) being commercial entities incentivized them to push through as many of the deals as they could without rocking the boat too much; the focus was on quantity (they charge a fee per certification), not quality; a ratings staffer is quoted in the Lewis book as complaining that she wasn't allowed to give B or triple B ratings to as many of the deals as she would have liked to; 2) the complexity of the financial instruments was challenging for the quality of staff they could afford to pay; the ratings agencies pay high 5 figure salaries compared to the 7 figure salaries of their bond trading brethren at the Wall Street firms, thus creating a brain drain, and thus stacking the deck against the agencies.

So, what's the answer? 

a) Should a federal agency push the private companies aside and rate all deals instead? (The ""quality of staff"" problem might remain; also, seems politically infeasible.)

b) Should a federal agency perform random sampling of the ratings by the agencies, and have the power to decertify a given agency? (This would leave it up to the agencies to deal with their staffing problem by, I suppose, raising their prices to Wall Street. It would create a feedback loop, allowing the feds to find holes in the models used by the agencies, and to perform deep analysis on given deals to check if the risk has been properly analyzed.)

c) Should the agencies be marginally on the hook for triple A rated deals that go bad? Perhaps as balance they could receive a marginal short on triple B rated deals; possibly this would give them enough revenue to lower or eliminate their fees altogether. That would incentivize them to rate appropriately, and also maybe prevent the Wall Street firms from disingenuously sending disguised toxic assets for rating.

politics,"Bullshit, Fred.","I work for FedEx Office (formerly Kinko's), and I got
[this letter](http://imgur.com/Dv4qt.jpg) from Fred Smith the other day.

Did you know FedEx was a railway? I didn't either, but it seems all FedEx Express employees are covered by the Railway Labor Act (RLA) instead of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). So what, you ask? Well, one of the key differences is that under the RLA, employees cannot unionize on a local basis. If they want to organize, there has to be *one union company-wide*. Obviously, that can make it a bit difficult to organize.

Now, UPS, the Teamsters, and others would like to see FedEx Express brought under the NLRA. I'm sure they are as self-interested as anyone else; nonetheless, from what I gather the bulk of the evidence is on their side. The RLA actually covers airlines as well as railroads, so it's not unreasonable for FedEx pilots to be covered by it, but apparently FedEx is the only company in America where *truck drivers* are covered by the RLA. In fact, there is language in the RLA that seems to specifically exclude truckers.

So while FedEx frames the issue as ""UPS is looking for a bailout,"" the truth is that FedEx has been getting special treatment all along, and UPS and its allies are just trying to level the playing field.

Anyway, Fred wants me to contact my elected representatives. Okay, I'll do that--and I'll tell them to put an end to FedEx's special status. I encourage anyone who cares about workers' rights to do the same.

politics,"Here's a letter my senator is sending everyone explaining the new Health Care law in a point-by-point manner,  and now I'm starting to see why the republicans are so shaken up by it.  It actually sounds pretty good.","Dear James,

 
President Obama has just signed into law historic health insurance reform legislation called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The Senate will now take up a package of fixes to make the bill even better.

 
I want to highlight some of the changes that middle-class families and small businesses will see over the next year:

 
**Starting Right Now...**

*     **Small businesses will get a tax cut** to help them pay for health insurance for their employees. Companies will get a credit up to 35 percent of the money they spend on premiums. Those credits will increase over time, eventually reaching 50 percent when the Insurance Exchanges go into effect. The full credit is available to small firms with 10 or fewer employees, and firms with up to 25 employees will qualify for a partial credit. 
 


*    The federal government will begin investing in **community health centers** to provide care to the people who need it most. In the next five years, $11 billion will be spent expanding access to health centers to 25 million more people in 10,000 communities. 
 



*     **Any senior who is affected by the so-called ""doughnut hole"" will qualify for a $250 rebate** to help them pay for their prescription medicines.

 


**In 3 Months...**

*     **People with pre-existing conditions will be able to get help** with a special fund set up to cover the gap until the Insurance Exchanges are up and running. 
 



*     **Retiree health plans** qualify for a new federal reinsurance program for health plans covering early retirees (age 55-64) to bring down costs for businesses and lower premiums.

 
**In 6 Months...**



*     **All health plans will be prohibited from denying coverage or care to children because of ""pre-existing conditions.""** This protection will apply to everyone when the Insurance Exchanges are up and running. 
 

*     All health plans will be required to allow **young adults to stay on their parents' insurance until age 26.** 
 


*     All new health plans will be required to provide **free preventive care** with no co-pays or deductibles. 
 


*     All health plans will be **prohibited from cancelling coverage when a patient reaches a lifetime limit** on coverage. 
 


*     All health plans will be **prohibited from cancelling coverage if a patient gets sick** or if they file too many claims. 
 


*     All new health plans will be required to **allow consumers to appeal insurance company denials of coverage** and get an independent review of their case. 
 



*     All new health plans will be required to **let you pick your own primary care doctor.** Women will also be allowed to visit their ob-gyn without getting permission from their insurance company first, and all patients will be guaranteed access to emergency care.



 
**On January 1, 2011...**



*    **Seniors in Medicare** can make an appointment for a **free annual wellness checkup** with their doctor. There will be no co-pays or deductibles for this visit. 
 



*     All insurance plans will be required to spend at least 80-85 percent of their revenues on medical care. **If they spend too much on wasteful overhead**, like executive salaries and advertising, **they will be required to give their customers a rebate**.

 


The package of fixes the Senate is working on now will make this good bill even better. This ""reconciliation package"" will be debated over the next few days. As we continue working on this issue, I remain committed to helping middle-class families, small businesses, and seniors afford the health care coverage they need. For updated information about this new legislation, you can visit my website at http://stabenow.senate.gov/healthcare. 

 
As always, please continue to keep me informed about issues of concern to you or your family.

 
Sincerely,

Debbie Stabenow

gaming,Retro Review: Dungeon Keeper 1,"Bullfrog did it again – and in this case, they set the bar higher then ever before. Bored of endless “fight evil, save the land, be the hero” rubbish? Fed up of the boring, predictable, unrealistic scenarios of good triumphing over evil? Then the violent, horrific and down-right gloriously evil solution: Dungeon Keeper!

Ever since the dawn of the first game, it has always been about saving, building, and protecting the innocent for the greater good. Dungeon keeper offers the other side – ever wondered where all these endless hordes of evil minions came from? In DK (dungeon keeper) you play the ultimate scythe-welding red horned ghoul intent to break free from the underworld and into the land of the green and happiness above!

An RTS to the fullest extent, this game has the whole resource management, base building and unit training aspects that are core to any decent RTS at its heart. It even dips ever so slightly into a first person mode where you can “possess” and control the simple minds of your own minions.

The game does a brilliant job of getting the gamer hooker from level 1, as every new map and level unlocks one or two new rooms/spells and possibly a new race of minion, so gives a strong feeling that is always advancing closer to the ultimate goal - to get rid of those “goodies” once and for all and to bring the underworld to the surface!

What first struck me about the game was how much thought and detail the designers put into it. Warlocks, when run out of things to research in the library, get bored and set fire to chickens from the hatchery, racial hatreds brake out between rivals, fed up minions start riots, minions looking for a laugh use prisoners as target practice. The feeling and personality of this society has been captured beautifully, and lets you know that just because your inhabitants are alike in there hatred for good, doesn’t mean that they are willing to put there petty squabbles aside!

I mean, come on, how hard is it to read a manual?  
  
They are printed on paper so you see them.  
  
We have been talking to MSI for a couple of years and came up with a solution.  
It has been implemented on a few boards for some time and with big success.  
It had various names, like CoreCenter (1st gathering tool) upto DrMOS (fully automatic)  

Some of you noticed because Windows wanted you to install a driver, but you couldn't find the manufacturer.  
On AMD systems this was called the Away-driver.  
  
What you didn't know is this, this driver activates the RTFM-chip. (Re-Turn inFormation to Manufacturer chip)  
It means it can detect if you read a manual as well stores the parameters you have set in the BIOS.  
As soon as you start Windows we are informed about your settings and manual readings.  
  
As we have been monitoring peoples behavior for some time and combined those with the RMA information from returned boards.
At the same time monitoring questions on the forum and matched the IP's.  
  
We have made a discovery.  
  
A lot of RMA is unneeded and unwanted, many happens due to user mistakes, numbers show that 90% of the RMA is OC people killing boards and newbies connecting the wrong connectors or insert parts that should not be inserted.  
  
Or simply forget to remove standoffs or CPU-power.  
MSI plans on tackles those numbers, and the RTFM-chip will give a readout of what you have done when it did post or attempted to post!  
Checking on you isn't new, Homeland-security done this ever you installed XP-SP3 or above, but their info in encrypted so useless to MSI.  
So MSI decided to ban people from support, RMA and the forum who has done the damage themselves or didn't read the manual the first of next month.  
We know who you are, and we have gathered enough information via our RTFM-chip.  
  
The only question is, should MSI continue to do this? As some information is real bad.  
Will this hurt your relation towards MSI products?  
  
Please let us know, as we have to talk to MSI management the first of next month and make them decide what to do with the information.

politics,Help! I am conservative.,"I don't usually come to reddit for the politics, but I thought on this maybe someone could help me out.

Because this turned out to be so hella-long, I will ask my question upfront...

Do I completely miss the point that proponents of healthcare expansion are trying to make?  Am I misunderstanding something, fundamentally, about their argument?  Are proponents of healthcare arguing for a “right to have” (as explained later on)?  If not, I would honestly appreciate it if reddit could help me understand that.

I am not a ""Republican"" in the sense that Rush Limbaugh or Glenn Beck is a Republican.  I feel like any paid political commentator is going to say and do a lot of stupid things, and that includes most major voices on both sides of the primary political divide.  One partial exception to that is Jon Stewart, who usually seems to think before he speaks, and at least have a reason to say something before he says it.

Also, although I don't love everything about Obama, I do love some of what he has done, especially regarding education reform, because our schools are balls and someone needs to fix them and I feel like he is not just honestly trying, but making some good moves in that direction.

I am also not against healthcare reform or helping people who have great need, but I do take issue with most discussion of healthcare reform, on the left and on the right.

It seems that a discussion on healthcare reform is a discussion of basic human rights, and how the government should act to protect those rights.  Talking about healthcare reform, though, isn't going to get anyone anywhere unless they can agree on something from which to argue, so an agreement must be made on what exactly my rights are, before we can argue over how the government should act to protect them.

It seems that a conservative viewpoint is that a person has the “right to do”.  Now, we could get into arguments about how well that is applied in specific areas by some conservatives (lets not), but at least with this topic, I am conservative and I am saying “do what you want as long as it doesn't endanger others or require government mandated social change or government mandated morality.”  

So I deserve to be able to have healthcare, but not to have healthcare (and here “able” doesn't take into account how probable something is).  I ascribe to this viewpoint.

Now, here is where I take an issue with what seems to be a liberal point of view, and am honestly hoping for some clarification.

For example, I have talked to about 5 different friends of mine who all seem to say something along these lines, and here I will quote -

“I'm not saying that I'm happy with the bill. But,I don't like the idea of letting people die from preventable and curable illness because of they can't afford health care in this day and age.”

Now I agree that healthcare could use some work, but this argument has nothing to do with that.  Essentially, it seems like she is saying “Bad things happen, someone should stop it, these companies aren't, so the government should” and thinking that somehow we are disagreeing.  I agree with all of that.  And when you look at the numbers http://www.commonwealthfund.org/usr_img/davis_figES-1.gif , obviously something should be done.  Of course, my friends don't speak for everyone, but that is the general impression I get across the board.

Now, here is the problem.  We aren't just talking about keeping companies honest (I will agree with anything you say in that regard), we are talking about providing a service to people who cannot themselves afford that service.  That is where I take issue.

It seems that  a liberal viewpoint argues from a person's “right to have”.  Essentially, by arguing for universal healthcare, an argument is being made that everyone deserves healthcare, not just the right to go get healthcare, but to actually have it.  In one way that makes sense, some people cannot just go get healthcare, so they would otherwise be excluded.  The same is true for housing, food, and other basic needs.

The problem with the “right to have” is that you can't have anything without A) earning it, B) being given it, or C) taking it by force.  I am fine with A &amp; B, but to me C seems downright immoral, even if you do it through your vote and the federal government.

Because resources are limited (to make things simple, just say $ is limited), in order for you to fulfill your “right to have” you are, by the very nature of it, infringing on my “right to have”.  So in this system, the “haves” are of course going to get upset, because they are being taken from disproportionately and getting less in return.

A “right to have” seems to be a one way right.  I can't have it if you do.  It seems like saying “the government should help these people” is like saying, “someone else should help these people, because I think they should be helped, but won't help them myself.”  

How many hundreds of millions of dollars and hours have been spent promoting a more universal healthcare system?  How many millions were spent fighting it?  Doesn't it seem stupid, absolutely stupid, to spend millions to gain more political influence than the other people who are spending millions so you can take even more millions from those people to pay for healthcare for other people, when you have 2 computers, a 360, a PS3, a newish car, and a WII all waiting for you at home and you have never donated a cent to charity in your entire life?

If it is our moral obligation to help others, why don't we fulfill that moral obligation instead of thinking we are better people because we voted for a politician who will take someone else's money and help someone.",technology,2010-03-25,-0.0340809920577183

politics,I pulled some numbers on the rich getting richer while their taxes drop faster from the Census Bureau.  Here are the statistics.,"tl;dr:  The rich are getting richer while the middle class gets poorer.  Tax rates are dropping across the board, but tax rates for the very rich are dropping much faster than for the middle classes.

In the course of a (well-mannered and well-thought-out) debate about health care reform, I pulled some numbers from the Census Bureau's annual report on income, poverty and health insurance coverage.  The entire report, if you can get through it, is interesting and disturbing.  The latest report was released in 2009 and covers 1988 to 2008.  You can find it in .pdf format [here](http://www.census.gov/prod/2009pubs/p60-236.pdf).

This is just a tiny piece of the story, but serves as a good illustration of the situation.  I apologize if it sounds patronizing to the body of scholars that IS Reddit.  I was trying to be simple and clear for the person with whom I was having the debate.  I covered the ten-year span from 1998, near the peak of the dot-com bubble, to 2008, the most recent year for which data are available.  It's worth noting that between 1998 and 2008 there was a crash, a period of recovery, and then another slump, so this isn't really an illustration of a steady slope.  Anyway, here's what I said:

""The Census Bureau's 2009 report on income, poverty and health insurance reported that the median household income in 2008 was about $50,303. The median income in 1998 in adjusted 2008 dollars (meaning adjusted for inflation) was $51,295—which means that the buying power of the median household income in the US actually decreased by about 1.93% over that ten year span. However, the mean household income of the highest income quintile—the richest fifth of the population—increased from $168,230 in 1998 to $171,057 in 2008 (again, both numbers are in 2008 dollars.) This means the buying power of the richest fifth of the population rose by about 1.68%. By comparison, the mean household income of the third quintile, right in the middle, decreased from $51,404 in 1998 to $50,132 in 2008, a decrease of about 2.47%. From 1998 to 2008, the highest quintile grew apart from the middle quintile by about 4.15%. The rich are getting richer by comparison to everyone else.

For purposes of illustration, then, let's examine the tax burden on a household that earned $200,000 in 1998. I'll use the tax figures for a couple that is married and filing jointly, since we're talking about households now. In 1998, this family paid $57,072 in taxes, or about 28.54% of their earnings. Adjusting for inflation according to the BLS' CPI inflation calculator, to be as wealthy as that household was in 1998, a household in 2008 would have to make $264,175.46. That family in 2008 paid $62,309.90 in taxes, or about 23.59% of their income. That means that over that ten-year period, the family making $200,000 in 1998 dollars saw the percentage of their income that they paid in taxes reduced by 4.95%.

Let's look at it another way. The mean income of the highest quintile in 1998 in current dollars was $127,529. So, if a married couple with that income filed jointly in 1998, they would have paid $28,758.49 in federal taxes, about 22.55% of their income. The mean income of the highest quintile in 2008 in current dollars was $171,057. A married couple filing jointly with that amount in 2008 would have paid $33,587.96 in taxes, or only about 19.64% of their income. That's a decrease of 2.91%.

For the sake of perspective, let's do this same comparison using the mean incomes in current dollars of the middle quintiles from 1998 and 2008. The mean income for the third quintile in 1998 was $38,967. That family paid $4,781 in taxes that year, or about 12.27% of their income. In 2008, the mean income for the third quintile was $50,132. That family paid $5,081 in taxes, about 10.14% of their income. The tax rate on their total earnings dropped over that ten year period by 2.13%. To conceptualize of these two numbers properly, consider that this is the tax rate that would be paid by a representative average income for a certain income bracket.

To summarize: The mean income of the highest income quintile, adjusted for inflation, has gotten higher by 1.68%, while the tax burden on that mean income has fallen by 2.91%. The mean income of the middle quintile has fallen by 2.47%, while the tax burden on its income has fallen by only 2.13%. Roughly speaking, a family that kept up with the growth of the highest quintile saw its taxes dropping faster than a family that grew poorer in pace with the middle quintile.

You can clearly see that the wealthy are keeping well ahead of any supposed tax increase*—in fact, taxes have been decreasing. You can also see that there's a a sort of sliding scale in place. The third quintile mean family has seen their tax rate drop by 2.13%, the highest quintile mean family has seen their tax rate drop by 2.91%, and a family that is as wealthy today as a family that made $200,000 in 1998 has seen their tax rate drop by a whopping 4.95%. Taxes are not only decreasing, they're decreasing faster for the people at the top.""

*This refers to a point in a different part of the argument.  My friend contended:  ""People who earn over $200,000 and couples who earn over $250,000 will pay 2.35% of their pay to Medicare instead of the current 1.45% (WAY TO MAKE PEOPLE WANT TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND MAKE A GOD {sic} LIVING)""

To which I retorted:

""Since we're talking about a single individual, let's examine that fortunate individual who is making over $200,000 a year. That 2.35% of that person's $200,000 salary amounts to $4,700. Are you telling me that the $195,300 left over just isn't enough? People are going to say 'oh, that's paltry, I'd rather just work at McDonald's and not bother with the effort?'

Just so you know what the numbers you're talking about really are, you're talking about taxing them 2.35%—$4,700—as opposed to 1.45%, which comes to $2,900. It's taking an extra 0.9% out of their annual wages. That's right. Not even 1%, from people for whom this loss still leaves $195,300. A person making the median income for wage earners over 25 years of age in this country, $32,140, would take more than six years to make what these wealthy people have left over after this intolerable tax increase.""

It may be insufficient in as many as 132.

While having a debate about health care reform (and this post does not directly pertain to health care reform) I came across some numbers published by the Virginia Department of Social Services in 2006.  You can find the report, along with their methods, [here](http://www.dss.virginia.gov/geninfo/reports/agency_wide/self_sufficiency.cgi).  Here's what I found, expanded a little for reddit.  It isn't absolutely precise--it doesn't take into account, for example, any extra income minimum-wage workers may recieve in the form of food stamps.  The point I was trying to illustrate was that federal minimum wage still isn't enough to live on in many places.

Originally, this had a discussion of tax burden as well, but I've cut that part out.  If a minimum wage earner takes only the standard deduction, in 2009 they paid 6.56% of their annual wages in taxes.  This makes the situation even worse, but if I dealt here with tax burden I would feel obliged in fairness to also discuss social security.

Some background:  Virginia is almost unique in that, for census and government purposes, it treats its cities as ""county-equivalent,"" rather than treating its cities as part of a county.  There are only three independent cities outside of Virginia the US (Baltimore, St. Louis, and Carson City.)  Virginia has 95 counties and 39 independent cities.

Virginia does not have a minimum wage law.  The US Department of Labor [lists 15 states](http://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/america.htm) (plus the District of Columbia, where minimum wage is fixed at one dollar over federal minimum) that have higher minimum wage rates than the federal rate, the highest being Washington at $8.55 and the closest to the federal wage being Ohio, at $7.30.

So:

If you consider an employee being paid federal minimum wage (currently $7.25) for 52 40 hour weeks a year, you come up with an annual wage of $15,080. The Virginia Department of Social Services estimates a minimum self-sufficiency wage (the cost of living on the bare essentials—food, shelter, and clothing, with no investments, no luxuries, and no emergency spending) for a single adult in Washington County at $14,819 annually. That's going to be on the low end of self-sufficiency wages—you can live here relatively cheaply. Gloucester County, where I grew up, is a relatively rural area near Newport News and several military installations, with a lot of military families. According to the Virginia DSS, the self-sufficiency wage there is $18,930—greater than the annual wage of a minimum-wage employee, and remember, this is just for the bare necessities. 

These self-sufficiency figures are from 2006. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers, annual average, rose from 201.6 in 2006 to 214.537 in 2009. That's about a 6.4% increase.  This means that the self-sufficiency wages have probably gone up.

As a matter of interest, the estimated self-sufficiency wage for Mannassas Park (the most expensive place in the state to live according to the VA DSS), part of the Virginia Washington Metropolitan Area, is $30,662. That's more than double the annual minimum wage figure before taxes.  If you look at it another way, the minimum hourly self-sufficiency wage in Manassas Park would be about $14.74.

The cheapest county in Virginia in which to live is Scott County, at $13,516 annually.

According to these numbers, in 26 of the 134 counties and indepedent cities in Virginia, federal minimum wage does not meet the Virginia Department of Social Service's 2006 figures for a self-sufficiency wage.

Let's look at it another way to examine some of the possible logical fallacies that come from mixing dates. The buying power of the dollar has actually dropped from 2006 to 2010. According to the [inflation calculator](http://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl) on the [Bureau of Labor Statistics website](www.bls.gov), $15,080 in 2010 has the buying power of only $14,026.55 in 2006. Falling buying power, or a rising consumer price index, means that a dollar just doesn't go as far today as it did in 2006. What that means is this: All other things being equal—and admittedly they never are quite—the self-sufficiency figure for Washington County from 2006, $14,819, is actually $15,931.97 in today's money. This is one measure of inflation—the falling buying power of a dollar over time. To illustrate: The Social Security Administration keeps track of the annual Cost of Living Adjustment they use to calculate benefits and taxation. The Cost of Living Adjustment for 2007 was up 2.3% from 2006, and in 2008, up 5.8% from 2007. There was no Cost of Living Adjustment in 2009 due to the economic slump. Clearly, the SSA feels that the cost of living has gone up since 2006. Basically, minimum wage workers are even further behind than the numbers I've produced.

If you were wondering, the actual minimum wage in 2006 was still frozen at a level established in 1997, $5.15. As you can see, the situation for a minimum wage worker was even worse then.  $5.15 multiplied by 40 hours, multiplied by 52 weeks, comes to $10,712.  According to the report by the VA DSS, in 2006, there was no county or city in Virginia in which this constituted a self-sufficiency wage.

As I've said, the self-sufficiency wage is a measure of the absolute bare minimum to get by—a house, clothing, food, with no consideration for future investments, leisure activities, or emergency expenses—you know, like a hospital visit that your insurance company maybe isn't helping out with.  If you're feeling a dash of charity, you can use the (usually) slightly more generous figures from [Pennsylvania State's Living Wage Calculator](http://www.livingwage.geog.psu.edu/), which is meant to allow for some other needs, like a little medicine and so on.  They put the living wage for Washington and Scott counties at $7.72.  Over a year, that puts a minimum wage earner behind $360.  In Manassas Park, if you're wondering, it's $12.34.

Astute redditors (and they all are) have no doubt noticed that the living wage provided by the living wage calculator for Mannassas Park, $25,667.20 annually, is, curiously, well below the self-sufficiency wage indicated by the VA DSS, $30,662 annually.  Worse, the Pennsylvania State Living Wage Calculator seems to provide data for 2010, and $25,667.20 in 2010 dollars, adjusted for inflation, is worth only $23,874.15 in 2006 dollars.  Or look at this way:  The self-sufficiency wage from 2006 for Mannassas Park, adjusted for inflation, is actually $32,964.84 in today's money.  Anyone who wants to delve into the differing methods of PSU and the VA DSS, or maybe some economics in Mannassas Park, is welcome to it and good luck.

Adjusted for inflation, the 2006 $18,930 2006 self-sufficiency wage for Gloucester County is $20,351.72 in today's money, but since that's still a few hundred dollars behind the living wage, I won't go looking for trouble.  The 2006 $14,819 self-sufficiency wage for Washington County is $15,931.97 in today's money, and the $13,516 self-sufficiency wage for Scott County is $14,531.11 in today's money.  To be fair, this is just inflation based on the change in the national consumer price index.  It does not allow for any local economic fluctuations.

When the self-sufficiency wages from the VA DSS report are adjusted for inflation, federal minimum wage is not enough for a self-sufficiency wage in 132 of 134 counties and independent cities--all but two.  Again, this based on national consumer price index and does not allow for local changes.

politics,Damn that Obama and his socialism. &lt;3 people with funny logic,"Ok so below is what I got from a friend on Google Buzz, what started out as a minor tiff regarding the health care bill miraculously turned into this response from her:


Obama surrounds himself with self described communists, socialist and anti-capitalists... Van Jones (self described communist), or white house communications director Anita Dunn.... whose favorite philosopher was Chairman Mao (Look up Mao... he makes Hitler look like a kindergartner when it comes to oppression and slaughtering the innocent)... or let's take the automobile take over of GM... puts in place a person who wrote a book on how capitalism does not work and why... in charge of the largest car manufacturer in the world... and doesn't believe in capitalism... so how is that going to work? But let's not stop there... let's go on the obama world appeasement tour.... let's bow to the Saudi's... or Chinese... let's tell the world that Iran needs to be listened to and conferred with... let's look at Israel today and the instability this administration has caused single handedly in the mideast.... If Iran goes nuclear there is no doubt they will either bomb Israel or give the bomb to someone else (they are really good at that) and Israel will be attacked. Israel knows that... the whole world knows that.. and even Obama has admitted it (that's where the intelligence thing you discussed starts to kick in) but what did BO do two days ago, disgraced Netanyahu and sent him home telling him he had to quit building an apartment building in his capital, Jerusalem. He's really helping out there. And what is the big deal anyway... right, it's just a bunch of Jews that shouldn't be there in the first place... right? If they get nuked, they nuke back or, much more likely, they go on the offense to stop the mass annihilation of their people and guess what, we got ourselves a world war.... You didn't see that on Bush's watch. Nor did you see the amount of spending going on. Did Bush spend like a drunken sailor? Yes. Was he fiscally irresponsible? Yes. Did the country go further into debt in his term? Yes. But Obama has outspent Bush's whole 8 years in office in his first year... that is a fact. And his spending just went up if you didn't notice it with the new healthcare bill. Not only a bad bill but one that trumps our liberty. Never before has government mandated we buy anything for the privilege of living... but you get that now with BO.. and if you don't get mandated insurance, the IRS will come and fine you and if you refuse to pay that.... you go to jail. Nice..... and expected if you live in Cuba. Just today, the CBO... the same CBO that this administration hid behind with their bogus healthcare numbers (500 billion in medicare cuts... will never happen and 250 billion in the ""doctors Fix"" which was reimbursing the doctors for the money they were cut out of being left out of the equation given to the CBO so they could make a whopping 138 billion in the first 10 years but do the math... now subtract the 750 billion of real money and how much do you make), announced that on the current Obama spend path, this country will be 10 trillion in debt per year which happens to be 90% of the total GDP (Gross Domestic Product for you progressive wannabes) but why should that matter.... capitalism doesn't work any way? So if Obama was so intelligent, why would he spend more than all of Bush in his first year... add a 2.4 trillion dollar healthcare bill on top of that, come out yesterday with telling the banks they must excuse all people who are currently out of a job from their mortgages (boy, that shouldn't be.... didn't they pass a stimulus bill that was mostly pork for ""shovel ready jobs"" and then another one recently because that one really didn't do the trick?). So yesterday, he tells the banks what to do... (another 3rd world marxist tactic...) ""you can't recoup your money because these poor people are out of work."" So what do the banks do... go under? Yes. What do the car companies do? Go under? Yes. Oh, back to the healthcare bill..... they added in the student loan takeover inside the reconciliation bill that BO s about to sign... why? Why take over all student loans from the banks? The answer is easy... if the government can regulate who gets student loans and how much, then they can regulate how you must spend that money.... what you study and what you will become.... sound a bit marxist to you? And will that hurt the banks... sure it will but who cares... capitalism doesn't work anyway right? Here's another marxist move on BO's part... in todays news... guess what... they want to extend unemployment insurance to those who are still out of a job? If you are getting the idea that we are out of money (the US) then you are right. Why is he demanding 10 billion more be spent on this... because he is an intelligent humane president? Really? No. He is pouring gas onto a raging fire and he knows how it will end. The monetary system will collapse. There are only two ways out... you either continue to sell government bonds and go further into debt to countries like China (communist) or you start printing money like Germany did... an action that led to Hitler's rise and World War II... it took a grocery cart full of money to go buy a loaf of bread. So how close are we to that? Well, guess what.... the government bonds weren't selling yesterday on the open market... no one wants them... so the interest rates just went up. That was announced today. America about to lose it's AAA credit rating which will mean that interest on all outstanding debts will increase dramatically..... do you see a death spiral here? Any idiot would.... especially an intelligent , ""I don't know which Ivy League school he went to"" President of the US. So ask your self why.... why does he surround himself with anti-capitalist..... why was he enamored with Saul Allinsky as a youth and still today... why did he hang out in Reverend Wrights church for 20 years of America hate speech.... why was and still is friends with Bill Ayers, a self avowed anarchist who verbally admits his only regret for bombing the pentagon and a NYPD police station in the 60's was that it didn't do more damage and have a greater effect.... why is he spending us into oblivion...

The answer is as plain as the mole on his face... he despises what this country represents and wants to radically change it... he's told us that 1000 times, and after signing the healthcare bill he said ""This is what change looks like."" He is proud that he is driving it under. He thinks, after a total monetary collapse, he can reinstate a new system... new currency, new laws (who needs the constitution, that just gets in the way... he said that not me when he was a ""professor"") and a new world where we all work for the government and the government takes care of us all. Who needs liberty when the government's there to take care of us right? And who will be running that country... why of course he will, and he won't have to worry about silly things like term limits. This dream he has, this very marxist dream of redistributing wealth, has never worked. He is not the first ""intelligent"" person to come up with this idea. Soviet Russia...failure, Cuba...failure...everywhere a failure except communist China... but then they were a failure until when... when they adopted a much more capitalistic approach to their economy... the Chi-com mentality. Chinese run businesses that run very much in a capitalistic manner on the outside.... you don't pay the workers shit... they are lucky to have a job right?.... but the rest of the model and how it interacts with the global economy is very much capitalistic. So that's Barry's big wet dream. He cut his teeth on the car company take over, then some of the banks and insurance companies... now healthcare and wow... he even got all of higher education inside a very corrupt healthcare bill. Onto immigration (there are many more to redistribute wealth to... don't let citizenship get in the way) and then the green initiative... And you think Bush was an idiot? Barry is a power hungry zealot with marxism in his heart. He hates what this country has accomplished.... a country who got there on the backs of the poor and enslaved..... but the real deal is, it is that same country that stands in his way of creating his own utopia.... and your dreams are in his way. I could go on forever... as you can see I just highlighted some of the more recent things... I could go back to when he got in office but why cover lost ground? Take a good look around you... look at the facts... there are plenty there and use your brain. Quit doing the feel good thing with notions like ""Bush Lied. People Died."" Start thinking about your tomorrow... and your kids tomorrow.... because that is being spent right now with all of these new entitlement programs meant to have the cause and effect that all economic indicators are red lining on...... In simple terms... your future ain't shit if Barry continues on this same course. And he will. Oh, and a little background on Barry as a small child (I will go back because we do get imprinted in our youth), his father was a communist... his mother married one..... his mother married another one, who like Barry and Van Jones, went to Ivy League school on a scholarship and left his wife and stepson to pursue his ideology. And Barry's mom left him with her parents to pursue anthropology... with a side passion for marxist teachings she found in Africa. So could Barry be a marxist????? Could he be a socialist? I mean, that would be just plain crazy that we would have something like that as president in the white house right? Go do your homework and then ponder your options for your future. Bush never tried to take that from you. He was too stupid I guess... he only went to Harvard and Yale and his daddy got him elected.

I'm assuming there can be one of several ways this can go down:

* 1) I never bring anything to do with my job up ever and keep my mouth shut while she talks about hers until I either explode on her or kill myself or learn to live with it.

* 2) I try to reason her out of her displeasure of the scientific method (which was force fed to her during training).

* 3) I try to compatibilize the two ways of approaching medicine.

* 4) I leave

politics,A friend posted ten reasons why health care is wrong for America. Please help me refute his argument.,"One Pill, Two Pill, Red Pill, Blue Pill: Top 10 Reasons Obamacare Is Wrong for America

1. Millions Will Lose Their Current Insurance. Period. End of Story: President Obama wants Americans to believe they can keep their insurance if they like, but research from the government, private research firms, and think tanks show this is not the... case. Proposed economic incentives, plus a government-run health plan like the one proposed in the House bill, would cause 88.1 million people to see their current employer-sponsored health plan disappear.

2. Your Health Care Coverage Will Probably Change Anyway: Even if you kept your private insurance, eventually most remaining plans—whether employer plans or individual plans—would have to conform to new federal benefit standards. Moreover, the necessary plan “upgrades” will undoubtedly cost you more in premiums.

3. The Umpire Is Also the First Baseman: The main argument for a “public option” is that it would increase competition. However, if the federal government creates a health care plan that it controls and also sets the rules for the private plans, there is little doubt that Washington would put its private sector “competitors” out of business sooner or later.

4. The Fed Picks Your Treatment: President Obama said: “They’re going to have to give up paying for things that don’t make them healthier. … If there’s a blue pill and a red pill, and the blue pill is half the price of the red pill and works just as well, why not pay half for the thing that’s going to make you well.” Does that sound like a government that will stay out of your health care decisions

5. Individual Mandate Means Less Liberty and More Taxes: Although he once opposed the idea, President Obama is now open to the imposition of an individual mandate that would require all Americans to have federally approved health insurance. This unprecedented federal directive not only takes away your individual freedom but could cost you as well. Lawmakers are considering a penalty or tax for those who don’t buy government-approved health plans.

6. Higher Taxes Than Europe Hurt Small Businesses: A proposed surtax on the wealthy will actually hit hundreds of thousands of small business owners who are dealing with a recession. If it is enacted, America’s top earners and job creators will carry a larger overall tax burden than France, Italy, Germany, Japan, etc., with a total average tax rate greater than 52%. Is that the right recipe for jobs and wage growth?

7. Who Makes Medical Decisions? What is the right medical treatment and should bureaucrats determine what Americans can or cannot have? While the House and Senate language is vague, amendments offered in House and Senate committees to block government rationing of care were routinely defeated. Cost or a federal health board could be the deciding factors. President Obama himself admitted this when he said, “Maybe you’re better off not having the surgery, but taking the painkiller,” when asked about an elderly woman who needed a pacemaker.

8. Taxpayer-Funded Abortions? Nineteen Democrats recently asked the President to not sign any bill that doesn’t explicitly exclude “abortion from the scope of any government-defined or subsidized health insurance plan” or any bill that allows a federal health board to “recommend abortion services be included under covered benefits or as part of a benefits package.” Currently, these exclusions do not exist.

9. It’s Not Paid For: The CBO says the current House plan would increase the deficit by $239 billion over 10 years. And that number will likely continue to rise over the long term. Similar entitlement bills in the past, including Medicare, have scored much lower than their actual eventual cost.

10. Rushing It, Not Reading It: We’ve been down this road before—with the failed stimulus package. Back then, we also heard that we were in a crisis and that we needed to pass a 1,000-plus-page bill in a few hours—without reading it—or we would have 8% unemployment. Well, we know what happened. Now, one Congressman has even said it’s pointless to read one of the reform bills without two days and two lawyers to make sense of it. Deception is the only reason to rush through a bill nobody truly understands.",finance,2010-03-30,-0.392432753161805

politics,PLEASE READ THIS. This is the propaganda you're fighting every time someone talks poorly about the healthcare bill.,"*This is what I was forwarded by someone I have been discussing health care with. This gentleman I've been discussing it with probably has an IQ in the range of 80-100, making him very swayable. Her currently does NOT have health insurance and pays out of pocket for all his health care expenses. He suffered a back injury at work several years ago and has been on pain medicine ever since, so his costs are numerous. He can qualify for insurance, but the cost is prohibitive to say the least. Yet he is buying into this shit.*

*I hope this gives you a better idea of the current paranoia surrounding the health care bill. Some pretty effect shit, I must admit.*

The Truth About the Health Care Bills - Michael Connelly, Ret. Constitutional Attorney   

Well, I have done it!  I have read the entire text of proposed House Bill 3200: The Affordable Health Care Choices Act of 2009. I studied it with particular emphasis from my area of expertise, constitutional law.  I was frankly concerned that parts of the proposed law that were being discussed might be unconstitutional.. What I found was far worse than what I had heard or expected.

To begin with, much of what has been said about the law and its implications is in fact true, despite what the Democrats and the media are saying.  The law does provide for rationing of health care, particularly where senior citizens and other classes of citizens are involved, free health care for illegal immigrants, free abortion services, and probably forced participation in abortions by members of the medical profession. 

The Bill will also eventually force private insurance companies out of business, and put everyone into a government run system.  All decisions about personal health care will ultimately be made by federal bureaucrats, and most of them will not be health care professionals.  Hospital admissions, payments to physicians, and allocations of necessary medical devices will be strictly controlled by the government. 

However, as scary as all of that is, it just scratches the surface.  In fact, I have concluded that this legislation really has no intention of providing affordable health care choices.  Instead it is a convenient cover for the most massive transfer of power to the Executive Branch of government that has ever occurred, or even been contemplated  If this law or a similar one is adopted, major portions of the Constitution of the United States will effectively have been destroyed. 

The first thing to go will be the masterfully crafted balance of power between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches of the U.S. Government.  The Congress will be transferring to the Obama Administration authority in a number of different areas over the lives of the American people, and the businesses they own. 

The irony is that the Congress doesn't have any authority to legislate in most of those areas to begin with!  I defy anyone to read the text of the U.S. Constitution and find any authority granted to the members of Congress to regulate health care. 

This legislation also provides for access, by the appointees of the Obama administration, of all of your personal healthcare direct violation of the specific provisions of the 4th Amendment to the Constitutioninformation, your personal financial information, and the information of your employer, physician, and hospital.  All of this is a protections against unreasonable searches and seizures.  You can also forget about the right to privacy.  That will have been legislated into oblivionregardless of what the 3rd and 4th Amendments may provide. 

If you decide not to have healthcare insurance, or if you have private insurance that is not deemed acceptable to the Health Choices Administrator appointed by Obama, there will be a tax imposed on you.   It is called a tax instead of a fine because of the intent to avoid application of the due process clause of the 5th Amendment. However, that doesn't work because since there is nothing in the law that allows you to contest or appeal the imposition of the tax, it is definitely depriving someone of property without the due process of law.. 

So, there are three of those pesky amendments that the far left hate so much, out the original ten in the Bill of Rights, that are effectively nullified by this law  It doesn't stop there though. 

The 9th Amendment that provides : The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people; 

The 10th Amendment states : The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are preserved to the States respectively, or to the people.  Under the provisions of this piece of Congressional handiwork neither the people nor the states are going to have any rights or powers at all in many areas that once were theirs to control. 

I could write many more pages about this legislation, but I think you get the idea.  This is not about health care; it is about seizing power and limiting rights.   Article 6 of the Constitution requires the members of both houses of Congress to ""be bound by oath or affirmation to support the Constitution."" If I was a member of Congress I would not be able to vote for this legislation or anything like it, without feeling I was violating that sacred oath or affirmation.  If I voted for it anyway, I would hope the American people would hold me accountable. 

For those who might doubt the nature of this threat, I suggest they consult the source, the US Constitution, and Bill of Rights . There you can see exactly what we are about to have taken from us.

Excellent piece by Scott Thill ... The threat to Wikileaks is indeed a chilling reminder of how devious our government is.

""""It's totally unsurprising,"" Greenwald told AlterNet. ""Over the last decade, we witnessed an unprecedented expansion of government secrecy and executive power, the former of which has intensified under Obama.""

To those of you worried about Tea Party Fascism this piece shows exactly who you should be worried about ... Your own Federal Government. They have the power and have erected the infrastructure in media, communications interception and law enforcement to take over our country if even there is a hint of insurrection within our borders.

Greenwald: ""The 'war on terror' has convinced huge numbers of Americans that transparency is not only unnecessary but dangerous. That's exactly the climate that led to the abuses of the last century and will inevitably lead to abuses whenever it is allowed to fester.""""

Wake up, smell the propaganda of the two party duopoly. The fights are paid for and staged by the powers that be for the benefit of a public they need to believe there is nothing outside the two party system. What we see is a fight between two factions of the same corporatocracy. The only choice we get, as the working and middle class, is who fleeces us and when. The Republicans want to take us out yesterday and the Democrats want to bleed us slowly ...

My two cents:

Forget about this well played out two party system. As if we Americans only have TWO FUCKING CHOICES. Are you kidding me? The founders, the millions of men who have DIED for the ideas and name of this country would be sickened to see how apathetic and brain-washed that everyone in this country has become. We are controlled by all media, whether it be the television or the video games, we as a society have disconnected ourselves from reality. 

Sure, our lives seem like they're great, but it's all one huge fucking simulation. The monopoly of food manufactures (only 3 slaughterhouses in America) control our meat supply. There are only 6 broadcast companies in this country who FEED us information. There are only two political parties. The entire government has marginalized itself with the interests of the companies, NOT THE PEOPLE. 

You wonder why it's just so hard to make ends meet. Hoping that running after that $75,000 college degree is going to get you over that hump in the long run. Settling for shit quality food which coincides with an increase in the populations cancer, high blood pressure, stroke, heart attack and heart disease rates. We've traded in comfort and ease for quality of life. The entire middle class is now the poor class. The poor class is off the fucking map and on the street, yet these ""invisible"" rich ""success"" stories who we continually hear about are only making their money off of US. We are in essence selling our work and lives to these people.

Does anyone here hunt anymore? Fuck no, you go to a store or a fast food market. Does anyone here actually make anything for themselves from their own land or resources? Hell no, you all sit in an office like me and work for some conglomerate nameless faceless company with 20 tiers of HR people and managers who run you through like rats in a maze.

If our generation cannot see how we are being played for absolute fucking fools, made to buy into anything companies feed us then we will not have free lives very much longer. Nothing is as it appears, ever. You may think that you're free but how free are you really? 

Also, it's funny how America pushes around other countries, yet sells them the tools to wage war, turns our backs and calls them the enemies while we advance our new tools to combat their old ones which we give them. Lol it's hilarious. The government has literally made us all dependent on the army and military forces. Other countries would most certainly not have the capability of waging war with us if it wasn't for our government setting them up to appear as though they pose a threat.

gaming,Can anyone help me find this browser game?,"It's from at least 6+ years back, a space RTS game. For some reason I have a really strong desire to play it again.

Highlights:
You had mining ships that went to moons and came back with minerals.
You had a Federation side and a rebel side.

Weapons were divided into Laser (Red), Ion (Blue), and Plasma (Purple) categories. You had regular small mounts, turrets that could rotate etc.

There was a campaign mode that I found really hard at the time (I think i was 8 or 9 haha)

So does anyone have any idea what this game might be?


EDIT: It's definitely a single player game. Primarily revolves around 2 campaigns, one from the federation (idk if that's what it was called, but it was the usual ""in power"" faction) and the ""rebellious"" faction. I specifically remember one mission where you must gather enough resources to construct 4-6 ""Corvettes"" and then use them to complete the mission by destroying an enemy fleet/base (cant remember which cause I failed at it).

EDIT2: The graphics are not cartoony (this should eliminate like 90% of browser games). I would say it resembles starcraft type of visual design (thought not as detailed, due to it being browser based).",technology,2010-04-05,-0.0146670454889578

Economics,The Fed’s Last Hurrah,"During the 1990s, inflationary Federal Reserve policy fueled a tech stock bubble. When that bubble burst, the Fed inflated a larger one in real estate. Now that the real estate bubble has burst, the Fed is inflating the biggest bubble of them all – a bubble in government. While the earlier booms at least provided the illusion of prosperity and some fun while they lasted, the government bubble will cripple the economy and deliver widespread misery to the vast majority of Americans. 

Of course, there will be winners in the government bubble, at least for a while. As was the case with the stock and real estate bubbles, plenty of money will be made by the well-connected and parasitic classes. Government employees will continue to enjoy pay raises at our expense, as will anyone benefiting from the new wave of subsidies, such as Wall Street investment bankers, financial speculators, and those working in health care or education. 

These gains will come at the expense of the taxpayers who foot the bill and the consumers who face higher prices. As government grows, it deprives the private sector of the resources it needs to survive and grow. The result is a lower overall standard of living. Not only are government jobs less productive than private sector jobs, but bureaucratic interference actually makes the remaining private sector jobs less efficient as well.

Our economy is being transformed from a mostly capitalistic one to a mostly socialistic one. More decisions are being made by politicians and lawyers in Washington and fewer by entrepreneurs. The motivation behind this shift is the mistaken belief that the financial crisis of 2008 was caused by too much capitalism and a lack of proper government oversight. This conclusion is self-serving for those in power, and couldn't be more economically misguided. Through corruption or just plain ignorance, Congress and this Administration have embraced an ideology that has failed every time it has been tried.

Take the recent student loan reforms that were slipped into the health care bill. Obama wants to reduce the cost of providing student loans by taking the profits out of the industry. According to Obama, student loans are too expensive because banks profit from making them. If the government nationalizes the function, we would apparently bring down costs by eliminating those pesky profits.

This is a Marxist argument, pure and simple. If true, it would apply to all industries, not just banking. States like Cuba and North Korea would be the envy of the world, as they prohibit profits across the board. The truth is that profits, earned from free-market competition, keep cost down. By taking the profits out and putting the bureaucrats in, any incentive to provide better service or lower costs is eliminated. It's not hard to predict that student loan costs will now rise faster than ever.

That is clearly not the result we want. To solve the problem, people must understand that college tuitions are so expensive specifically because the government has guaranteed student loans (see my video blog on this topic for a detailed explanation). Guaranteed loans don't mean more access to education, but rather that universities are free to charge more per pupil than if their customers were paying out-of-pocket. 

Obama's plan only serves to remove more market forces and creates an even bigger moral hazard. Under the new rules, students will be required to repay a much smaller portion of what they borrow. As a result, students will be willing to borrow even greater amounts of cash to pay inflated tuitions, making it that much easier for colleges and universities to raise them.

Also, since the government will actually be loaning the money directly, rather than simply guaranteeing private-sector loans, the Treasury will actually have to borrow the money itself before it can re-lend it to students. I suppose the irony of going into debt to loan money never registers in Washington. Further, as this bill will cause tuitions to rise even faster, it will necessitate even larger loans that will produce even greater taxpayer losses when the loans end in default or forbearance.

Whether it is in education, housing, health care, automobiles, insurance, or banking, greater government involvement in the economy means higher prices, lower productivity, more bailouts, bigger deficits, increased taxes, diminished industrial capacity, fewer private sector jobs, less freedom, and a falling standard of living. 

In the end, when runaway inflation and skyrocketing interest rates burst the government bubble, there will be no more bubbles to replace it – just one hell of a hangover.",finance,2010-04-06,-0.3648304052240492

Obama will hear calls that the feds bailed out Bear Stearns but won't bail out ""Main Street"". He may pull a ""back-door"" bail out to avoid the huge damage his popularity would take in fiscally responsible states, but no way does he ignore Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein crawling so far up his ass he chokes on their bony skulls. In the end, I'd bet money that Cali gets bailed out.

software,Any recommendations on a good browser-based visualizer for database data?,"I'm trying to figure out an application for a small office to use, one where no one is especially computer-adept (they use software just fine, but no one can program). The ideal program would be a website that I could log into, connect it to my database, then be able to view table data both in record format, but also draw them out in charts (have those chart settings saved), and have them automatically redrawn every minute or so. The main selling point being that it is within the interface that you can select the data and design the chart - that way the office personnel can design the data they're using within the GUI.

Now, obviously I can write my own PHP script to export data from the MySQL table, and use a variety of Javascript/Flash libraries and tools to draw charts. The problem with this is that I won't be around to maintain it. So either I have to program every possible view they could want, or program a more general GUI that does alot of the features of the above feature (which would take too much time).

&gt;China’s foreign currency reserves will be “one asset” that can be used to fund a cleanup of the banking system, he said. The country has accumulated a record $2.4 trillion of reserves...

Why people can't seem to get this through their head?  Everyone seems to think that the People's Bank of China (PBoC) has some sort of piggybank of U.S. Dollars that they can spend as they please.  They can't.  The PBoC's dollars are **simply the asset side of a leveraged balance sheet**.  The PBoC has dollars, sure, but they are matched by an enormous wad of RMB liabilities.

Remember, dollars can only be used to fund foreign purchases, not domestic ones.  So if the PBoC decided to spend some money on re-capitalizing a bank, that would automatically burn a hole into their balance sheet.  From there, they would have three choices: 1. borrow more RMB from the country's nascent bond market (which definitely couldn't absorb much without jacking up interest rates) 2. use tax dollars 3. print money and have an inflation party

Reddit, I've been thinking: even though home computers and the Internet have
been around for quite some time now, it seems to me that we haven't made it to
the 21st when it comes to political participation: we still use methodologies
that were common in the age of paper, typewriter, and telephone.  So I'm
asking you: **How can we use computers and the Internet to improve how we deal
with political participation and the political process in general?**

I'll go first:

## Political bugtracker/issuetracker to keep track of what's wrong with The System

One major annoyance to me is that reports on political problems are scattered
over thousands of news sites, blogs etc., i.e. they are very difficult to find
which hinders gathering information.  Most reports simply disappear into
oblivion without having induced any kind of improvement.  As a solution to
this problem I suggest creating a tool to collect, structure, and summarize
reports on political problems at a central location similiar to a
bugtracker/issuetracker like Bugzilla.  With good-quality metadata to make
filtering easy the political problem-space should lose a great deal of its
inherent complexity.

What information to collect for an issue entry?

&gt; **title**: issue title  
&gt; **abstract**: very short description of the problem  
&gt; **description**: longer description of the problem  
&gt; **causes**: detailing the causes of the problem  
&gt; **effects**: detailing the effects of the problem  
&gt; **approaches**: detailing possible approaches to solve the problem  
&gt; **resolution**: describing how the problem was solved in the end  
&gt; **notes**: miscellaneous notes (primarily for editors, readers probably should not see them)  
&gt; **context**: describing the political context of the problem  
&gt; **bginfo**: detailed background information  
&gt;
&gt; **class**: what class of problem is the problem? {incidental|systemic|personal|institutional|societal|humanitarian|...}  
&gt; **sector**: where in the system is the problem located? {health sector|education sector|legislative branch|...}  
&gt; **status**: the current status of the problem {resolved|unconfirmed|confirmed|...}  
&gt; **urgence**: how urgent is the problem? {highly urgent|urgent|not urgent|...}  
&gt; **importance**: how important is the problem? {highly important|important|not important|...}  
&gt; **geoscope1**: in which geographical territory is the problem located?  
&gt; **geoscope2**: for which geographical territories is the problem relevant? (this is mainly for severe problems relevant to a wider audience, e.g. genocides, wars, humanitarian catastrophies etc.)  
&gt; **precision**: how sharply/precisely/concretely is the problem formulated? {very precise|precise|fuzzy|...}  

Additionally, references to external resources (books, web articles, etc.)
should be saved as well.

When implemented correctly, a user can simply enter where he lives, and is
then presented with a list of political problems grouped by global, federal,
state, and community level and ranked by urgence/importance/etc.  He would
then have a clear overview over the political problems he has to solve.  An
additional benefit would be that different special interest groups can finally
combine their efforts on one platform which should greatly help their causes.
At the same time we would have in our hands a list of all political problems
of the world.

The issuetracker should be as generic and internationalized as possible.

## Miscellaneous other ideas

The following is a list of ideas which I deem somewhat useful, but not as
useful as the issuetracker.

+ **Versioned law text repository**

    Law texts (and all their functional equivalents regardless of their names)
    make up the rules The System runs by.  For certain entries in the
    issuetracker to be sufficiently concrete they need to refer to those
    sections in the law text corpus which are seen as buggy.  Therefore a
    versioned repository of law texts is needed.  Also it would be pretty neat
    to use tools like `diff`, `patch`, `quilt`, and all the other
    text-manipulating programs to handle law text (which like source code is
    just a form of structured text).

    Designing this correctly seems pretty difficult as law text structures
    vary around the globe.  A skilled designer should accomplish it
    nonetheless.  I realize that there already must be systems that do what I
    have in mind, but AFAIK none of them are free to access (at least I
    couldn't find any).

+ **Free NNDB equivalent**

    The [Notable Names Database](http://www.nndb.net/) is very useful when you
    want to analyze the political relationships and how they influence the
    process of policy-making.  However the NNDB has serious shortcomings: it's
    pretty old, slow with updates, uncomfortable to use, and its content is
    not free (GPL or anything like that).  I think the time has come for a
    free NNDB replacement.

+ **News source appraisal database**

    We redditors all consume information, but we often don't do it
    methodically, and this shouldn't be.  What we should do, is systematically
    tracking the quality of the information our sources (TV shows, newspapers,
    blogs, etc.) provide, and then consume the ones that score best.  For this
    we need a database where we can catalog pieces of information and analyze
    them following some sort of score guideline.  If done correctly, the
    database will provide use with systematic estimations about the quality of
    an information product (website, newspaper, journal, TV/radio show, etc.)
    so we can optimize our information retrieval processes.

+ **News Trees**

    Political events unfold in a tree-like/graph-like manner which, when
    visualized, would probably ressemble something like
    [this](http://gitguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/team_branches.png) or
    [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/LinuxDistroTimeline.png/358px-LinuxDistroTimeline.png).
    When news companies report on those events, they serialize the graph, so
    we have to de-serialize it in our heads to reconstruct the unfolding
    processes.  This de-serialization process is difficult, we are bad at it,
    and this impairs our judgement.  Why are we still doing this by hand?
    What we need is a tool that displays news articles not in a serialized way
    (as almost all CMS do now), but in a way that accurately mirrors the graph
    of unfolding events.  With technologies like SVG, Canvas (or even Flash,
    if all else fails) we should be able to abolish the tyranny of serialized
    news coverage.  If we take the visualization of branching/merging in our
    version control systems for granted, why don't we demand the same
    functionality for our news coverage?

+ **Web article annotation distributor**

    Not all articles on the web are of high quality.  Some are pretty bad and
    outright misleading, but it is often hard to tell for an individual that
    lacks proper media literacy.  It would be cool if I could annotate any
    given article I find on the web, and distribute these annotations so
    others could easily see them when they read that article.  A reddit-style
    rating mechanism should ensure that good annotations are favored over bad
    ones.  With technologies like UserJS/GreaseMonkey, JSONP, and
    regexp-replacements, this should be pretty easy to implement and far
    better than scattering analysis and comments on blogs all across the web
    where no one reads them.

+ **A directory/map of political projects on the Internet**

    In the past I have been searching the net for political services of all
    kind, but I have not found a comprehensive list of projects.  Everything
    seems to be scattered in the worst possible way.  This should be fixed
    with a carefully-crafted directory of political web sites.  Maybe a map
    like [this](http://xkcd.com/256/) might prove helpful as well.

politics,Do you have any ideas for improving our methods of political participation?,"**TL;DR**: I present a few ideas to improve the way we deal with political
participation and encourage you to do the same.

Reddit, I've been thinking: even though home computers and the Internet have
been around for quite some time now, it seems to me that we haven't made it to
the 21st when it comes to political participation: we still use methodologies
that were common in the age of paper, typewriter, and telephone.  So I'm
asking you: **How can we use computers and the Internet to improve how we deal
with political participation and the political process in general?**

I'll go first:

## Political bugtracker/issuetracker to keep track of what's wrong with The System

One major annoyance to me is that reports on political problems are scattered
over thousands of news sites, blogs etc., i.e. they are very difficult to find
which hinders gathering information.  Most reports simply disappear into
oblivion without having induced any kind of improvement.  As a solution to
this problem I suggest creating a tool to collect, structure, and summarize
reports on political problems at a central location similiar to a
bugtracker/issuetracker like Bugzilla.  With good-quality metadata to make
filtering easy the political problem-space should lose a great deal of its
inherent complexity.

What information to collect for an issue entry?

&gt; **title**: issue title  
&gt; **abstract**: very short description of the problem  
&gt; **description**: longer description of the problem  
&gt; **causes**: detailing the causes of the problem  
&gt; **effects**: detailing the effects of the problem  
&gt; **approaches**: detailing possible approaches to solve the problem  
&gt; **resolution**: describing how the problem was solved in the end  
&gt; **notes**: miscellaneous notes (primarily for editors, readers probably should not see them)  
&gt; **context**: describing the political context of the problem  
&gt; **bginfo**: detailed background information  
&gt;
&gt; **class**: what class of problem is the problem? {incidental|systemic|personal|institutional|societal|humanitarian|...}  
&gt; **sector**: where in the system is the problem located? {health sector|education sector|legislative branch|...}  
&gt; **status**: the current status of the problem {resolved|unconfirmed|confirmed|...}  
&gt; **urgence**: how urgent is the problem? {highly urgent|urgent|not urgent|...}  
&gt; **importance**: how important is the problem? {highly important|important|not important|...}  
&gt; **geoscope1**: in which geographical territory is the problem located?  
&gt; **geoscope2**: for which geographical territories is the problem relevant? (this is mainly for severe problems relevant to a wider audience, e.g. genocides, wars, humanitarian catastrophies etc.)  
&gt; **precision**: how sharply/precisely/concretely is the problem formulated? {very precise|precise|fuzzy|...}  

Additionally, references to external resources (books, web articles, etc.)
should be saved as well.

When implemented correctly, a user can simply enter where he lives, and is
then presented with a list of political problems grouped by global, federal,
state, and community level and ranked by urgence/importance/etc.  He would
then have a clear overview over the political problems he has to solve.  An
additional benefit would be that different special interest groups can finally
combine their efforts on one platform which should greatly help their causes.
At the same time we would have in our hands a list of all political problems
of the world.

The issuetracker should be as generic and internationalized as possible.
Aspects of internationalization, localization, data privacy, scalability,
security, and accessibility should be considered from the beginning.  It
should always be remembered that the goal is to reduce the cognitive stress
caused by the complexity of the political process, so both the system and the
user interface should be kept simple.

It is needless to say that such a project should run under a GPL/GDL-style
license.

## Miscellaneous other ideas

The following is a list of ideas which I deem somewhat useful, but not as
useful as the issuetracker.

+ **Versioned law text repository**

    Law texts (and all their functional equivalents regardless of their names)
    make up the rules The System runs by.  For certain entries in the
    issuetracker to be sufficiently concrete they need to refer to those
    sections in the law text corpus which are seen as buggy.  Therefore a
    versioned repository of law texts is needed.  Also it would be pretty neat
    to use tools like `diff`, `patch`, `quilt`, and all the other
    text-manipulating programs to handle law text (which like source code is
    just a form of structured text).

    Designing this correctly seems pretty difficult as law text structures
    vary around the globe.  A skilled designer should accomplish it
    nonetheless.  I realize that there already must be systems that do what I
    have in mind, but AFAIK none of them are free to access (at least I
    couldn't find any).

+ **Free NNDB equivalent**

    The [Notable Names Database](http://www.nndb.net/) is very useful when you
    want to analyze the political relationships and how they influence the
    process of policy-making.  However the NNDB has serious shortcomings: it's

    free NNDB replacement.

+ **A decision radar so you know on what and when to focus your energy**

    The political process manifests itselfs as a chain of decision acts.  He
    who wants to influence this process must know when these decisions will be
    made.  Decisions should be plotted on a 2D radar-like screen with the X
    axis representing the importance of the decision (left: very important,
    right: not so important), and the Y axis representing the amount of time
    left until the decision will be made.  The Y axis should represent time in
    a non-linear way so that decisions which are still far away in time close
    in slower than decisions which are already very near.

+ **Metrics of Power / Organigram of Power**

    It would be nice to know how power is distributed across the individuals
    of a collective.  Then you could answer questions like ""Who are the ten
    most powerful people in Canada?""  For this you need one (or several)
    metric(s) to measure how powerful one person or group is.  These metrics
    could include: wealth, education, political offices held, family ties etc.
    Then you could make up a certain threshold value and anyone or any group
    above it is then declared as too powerful.  The public can then join
    efforts to re-limit this person's or group's power.

The following is a list which I can't elaborate here due to Reddit's 10k char
limit.

+ **Political promise tracker**

+ **Politics by numbers**

+ **A directory/map of political projects on the Internet**

political participation, chiefly a political bug tracker, and encourage you to
do the same.

Even though home computers and the Internet have been around for quite some
time now, it seems to me that we haven't made it to the 21st century when it
comes to political participation: we still use methodologies developed in the
age of typewriter and phone, and that holds us back.  So I ask you: **How can
we use computers and the Internet to improve how we deal with political
participation and the political process in general?** I'll go first.

## Political bug/issue tracker to keep track of what's wrong with The System

One major annoyance to me is that reports on political problems are scattered
over thousands of news sites, blogs etc., i.e. they are too difficult to find
which hinders gathering information.  Most reports simply disappear into
oblivion without having induced any kind of improvement.  To solve this I
suggest creating a tool to collect, structure, and summarize reports on
political problems at a central location similiar to a bug/issue tracker like
Bugzilla.  With proper metadata for easy filtering the political problem-space
should lose much of its inherent complexity.

What information to collect for an issue entry?

&gt; **title**: issue title  
&gt; **abstract**: very short description of the problem  
&gt; **description**: longer description of the problem  
&gt; **causes**: detailing the causes of the problem  
&gt; **effects**: detailing the effects of the problem  
&gt; **approaches**: detailing possible approaches to solve the problem  
&gt; **resolution**: describing how the problem was solved in the end  
&gt; **notes**: miscellaneous notes (primarily for editors, readers probably should not see them)  
&gt; **context**: describing the political context of the problem  
&gt; **bginfo**: detailed background information  
&gt;
&gt; **class**: what class of problem is the problem? {incidental|systemic|personal|institutional|societal|humanitarian|...}  
&gt; **sector**: where in the system is the problem located? {health sector|education sector|legislative branch|...}  
&gt; **status**: the current status of the problem {resolved|unconfirmed|confirmed|...}  
&gt; **urgence**: how urgent is the problem? {highly urgent|urgent|not urgent|...}  
&gt; **importance**: how important is the problem? {highly important|important|not important|...}  
&gt; **geoscope1**: in which geographical territory is the problem located?  
&gt; **geoscope2**: for which geographical territories is the problem relevant? (this is mainly for severe problems relevant to a wider audience, e.g. genocides, wars, humanitarian catastrophies etc.)  
&gt; **precision**: how sharply/precisely/concretely is the problem formulated? {very precise|precise|fuzzy|...}  

Additionally, references to external resources (books, web articles, etc.)
should be saved as well.

When implemented correctly, a user can simply enter where he lives, and is
then presented with a list of political problems grouped by global, federal,
state, and community level and ranked by urgence/importance/etc.  He would
then have a clear overview over the political problems he has to solve.  An
additional benefit would be that different special interest groups can finally
combine their efforts on one platform which should greatly help their causes.
At the same time we would have in our hands a list of all political problems
of the world.

The issuetracker should be as generic and internationalized as possible.
Aspects of internationalization, localization, data privacy, scalability,
security, and accessibility should be considered from the beginning.  It
should always be remembered that the goal is to reduce the cognitive stress
caused by the complexity of the political process, so both the system and the
user interface should be kept simple.

It is needless to say that such a project should run under a GPL/GDL-style
license.

## Miscellaneous other ideas

The following is a list of ideas which I deem somewhat useful, but not as
useful as the issuetracker.

+ **Versioned law text repository**

    Law texts (and all their functional equivalents regardless of their names)
    make up the rules The System runs by.  For certain entries in the
    issuetracker to be sufficiently concrete they need to refer to those
    sections in the law text corpus which are seen as buggy.  Therefore a
    versioned repository of law texts is needed.  Also it would be pretty neat
    to use tools like `diff`, `patch`, `quilt`, and all the other
    text-manipulating programs to handle law text (which like source code is
    just a form of structured text).

    Designing this correctly seems pretty difficult as law text structures
    vary around the globe.  A skilled designer should accomplish it
    nonetheless.  I realize that there already must be systems that do what I
    have in mind, but AFAIK none of them are free to access (at least I
    couldn't find any).

+ **Free NNDB equivalent**

    The [Notable Names Database](http://www.nndb.net/) is very useful when you
    want to analyze the political relationships and how they influence the
    process of policy-making.  However the NNDB has serious shortcomings: it's
    pretty old, slow with updates, uncomfortable to use, and its content is
    not free (GPL or anything like that).  I think the time has come for a
    free NNDB replacement.

+ **News source appraisal database**

    We redditors all consume information, but we often don't do it
    methodically, and this shouldn't be.  What we should do, is systematically
    tracking the quality of the information our sources (TV shows, newspapers,
    blogs, etc.) provide, and then consume the ones that score best.  For this
    we need a database where we can catalog pieces of information and analyze
    them following some sort of score guideline.  If done correctly, the
    database will provide use with systematic estimations about the quality of
    an information product (website, newspaper, journal, TV/radio show, etc.)
    so we can optimize our information retrieval processes.

+ **News Trees**

    Political events unfold in a tree/graph-like manner which, when
    visualized, might resemble something like
    [this](http://gitguru.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/team_branches.png) or
    [this](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ed/LinuxDistroTimeline.png/358px-LinuxDistroTimeline.png).
    When news companies report on those events, they serialize the graph, so
    we have to de-serialize it in our heads to reconstruct the unfolding
    processes.  This de-serialization process is difficult, we are bad at it,
    and this impairs our judgement.  Why are we still doing this by hand?
    What we need is a tool that displays news articles not in a serialized way
    (as almost all CMS do now), but in a way that accurately mirrors the graph
    of unfolding events.  With technologies like SVG, Canvas (or even Flash,
    if all else fails) we should be able to abolish the tyranny of serialized
    news coverage.  If we take the visualization of branching/merging in our
    version control systems for granted, why don't we demand the same
    functionality for our news coverage?

+ **Web article annotation distributor**

    Not all articles on the web are of high quality.  Some are pretty bad and
    outright misleading, but it is often hard to tell for an individual that
    lacks proper media literacy.  It would be cool if I could annotate any
    given article I find on the web, and distribute these annotations so
    others could easily see them when they read that article.  A reddit-style
    rating mechanism should ensure that good annotations are favored over bad
    ones.  With technologies like UserJS/GreaseMonkey, JSONP, and
    regexp-replacements, this should be pretty easy to implement and far
    better than scattering analysis and comments on blogs all across the web
    where no one reads them.

+ **A decision radar so you know on what and when to focus your energy**

    The political process manifests itselfs as a chain of decision acts.  He
    who wants to influence this process must know when these decisions will be
    made.  Decisions should be plotted on a 2D radar-like screen with the X
    axis representing the importance of the decision (left: very important,
    right: not so important), and the Y axis representing the amount of time
    left until the decision will be made.  The Y axis should represent time in
    a non-linear way so that decisions which are still far away in time close
    in slower than decisions which are already very near.

+ **Metrics of Power / Organigram of Power**

    It would be nice to know how power is distributed across the individuals
    of a collective.  Then you could answer questions like ""Who are the ten
    most powerful people in Canada?""  For this you need one (or several)
    metric(s) to measure how powerful one person or group is.  These metrics
    could include: wealth, education, political offices held, family ties etc.
    Then you could make up a certain threshold value and anyone or any group
    above it is then declared as too powerful.  The public can then join
    efforts to re-limit this person's or group's power.

The following is a list which I can't elaborate here due to Reddit's 10k char
limit.

+ **Political promise tracker**

+ **Politics by numbers**

+ **A directory/map of political projects on the Internet**

programming,I'm a little steamed. Tell me I'm nuts. I'm suspicious that Microsoft spams fake opinions of Vista. (details inside),"Ok so I've been meaning to write a ""vista sucks"" post for quite some time. But I didn't want to come off as someone with shallow and superficial complaints.

BUT

I noticed something odd. Every time I got fed up enough to research it I had a similar experience. ""These aren't the droids you're looking for"". Almost every thread or online discussion I've found about vista sucking has someone responding in strong defense of vista. The ""windows defender"" claims to know quite a bit about computers, references competitors, talks a little high-falutin jargon sometimes and explains that vista is a huge improvement and that it is the best OS ever. 

Supporting evidence:

Let google auto-complete ""why is vista so..."" options are largely ..""so bad"" ""so slow"" etc...top one is ""why is vista so bad"".

View the results.

Top result is a question at CNET...question is ""i got a computer with it, and haven't had any problems... yet. should i be expecting some?"" 

Top response is nonsensical. Basically....people love it...but I hate it...""but, since you're satisfied, don't start looking and just keep smiling. :)""

Second result in our google search is at Yahoo Answers... 

Question begins ""I've been using Vista for a week and nothing really bad happened as people said."" The rest a glowing review of features...""rocks"" ""pretty good"" ""nothing really bad"" ""I don't understand"" 

Chosen answer claims some compatability issues but ""Otherwise than that, Vista is the best OS I've used so far.""

Goes on to tout features in the same manner as asker. Then offers a link to microsoft to buy vista.

So I've always been suspicious of these and you can find tons more. So I wanted to see what's up with the yahoo user who answered. The answerer ""Chris K"" has 7 aliases, some with ambiguous titles suggesting conflicting genders..""Leslia"" ""Jessie"" ""Michael"" ""Bossman"" ""gameplayer""....

Yahoo posts a notice below his profile info with his aliases ""The following accounts are operated by the same person. They use their multiple IDs to cheat on this board:"" Also the asker's profile is removed...

None of ""Chris K""'s questions and answers are displayed in his profile instead it says ""Chris K's Q&amp;As are private.""

Same for his fans, contacts and starred questions.

To be scientific I check other user profiles. All of the first five I check are completely public. Like reddit...folks want credit. Try it yourself.

Economics,Krugman Strikes Again,"In a commentary two weeks ago, I rebutted dangerously silly arguments put forward by New York Times columnist Paul Krugman about how the United States should pressure China to drop its support for the U.S. dollar, [click here to view](http://www.reddit.com/r/Economics/comments/bf8kb/paul_krugman_versus_reality/). Although there is far more happening in the world outside of Mr. Krugman’s brain than within it, fresh drivel from the acclaimed Nobel Prize winner compels me to turn my focus there once again. 

In today’s column, Krugman analyzes the Greek debt crisis, arguing that the best solution for Athens would be to simply inflate away its debt burden with printing press money. Krugman laments that this sensible option is being foreclosed by the monetary priggishness of the German heavyweights in the European Union, who are ‘foolishly’ seeking to prevent inflation and impose fiscal discipline. 

His theoretical justification is put forward in a familiar Keynesian recipe: deficit spending leads to inflation and growth, which leads to greater employment and rising GDP, which makes debt payments much easier to bear in relative terms. He laments that Greece does not control its own currency and is therefore unable to pursue such a policy on its own accord. He implores U.S. policy makers, who do control their own monetary policy, to take heed of the danger and avoid such a course. 

In simple terms, Krugman believes that inflation is the best cure for burdensome debt problems. To prove his arguments, he points to the course followed by the Unites States in the decade after the Second World War. In 1946, due to unprecedented military spending during the war, U.S. public debt as a percentage of GDP came in at a staggering 122 percent – which is even higher than the 113 percent currently weighing on Greece. 

Krugman endorses U.S. policy at the time which, he claims, concentrated on fostering growth instead of taking measures to drastically cut the post-war debt. He notes that by the end of 1956, the federal debt had not diminished in nominal terms, but had become much easier to bear because of the decade of GDP growth that inflationary policies had created. 

He neglects to mention that during the five years from 1945 to 1949, federal spending dropped by 58% and taxes fell by 12%. Meanwhile, the budget deficit fell by 66% in 1946 and was in surplus from 1947 to 1949. [i] In other words, although we did not pay down our nominal debt in the decade after the war, we did succeed in massively shrinking government and the burden that it places on society. Could it be that this had something to do with the post-war boom, or should we give all the credit to the monetary policy? (It is important to point out that our national debt did initially decline from 1945 to 1949, but the extra spending necessary to finance the Korean War reversed that trend.)

Also, after the war ended, American factories quickly retooled production from military hardware to consumer goods. The products not only created a domestic boom in living standards, but were also in high demand in war-ravaged Europe. The late 1940’s and 1950’s produced some of the largest U.S. trade surpluses (in relative terms) in our history. 

Today, government spending is rising at the fastest pace on record (not fast enough for Krugman) and our trade deficit is growing as well. In 2011, the government is forecast to spend $3.8 trillion.[ii] To truly replicate post-war fiscal policy, in the next four years: federal spending would have to be slashed by $2.1 trillion to $1.5 trillion, tax revenues would have to be lowered from $2.4 trillion to $2.1 trillion, and the federal budget would have to record a $650 billion surplus. [iii] [iv] Since Krugman would never support these spending and tax cuts, he must feel that similar success can be achieved solely through the monetary policy of inflation.

In his column, Krugman warns that the biggest danger of the austerity measures necessary for Greece (and the United States) to pay down debt organically is the deflation that would ensue. Like most of his academic peers, Krugman believes that falling prices are the economic equivalent of kryptonite, guaranteed to bring low even the mightiest economy. 

He is wrong. We need deflation. As a result of a phony boom in assets, prices levels are still too high relative to the earning power and productivity of American workers. Falling prices will cushion the blow of recession (by allowing people to buy more with their paychecks and savings) and will eventually encourage people to spend when prices fall low enough. Deflation is the only way to save us from the much greater horror of inflation, or hyper-inflation, which Krugman argues is not actually that bad.

Inflation can’t save us from lower real wages and falling living standards, it will simply change the manner in which we are impoverished. With deflation, workers’ wages fall; with inflation, consumer prices rise. Deflation hurts, but inflation can spiral out of control, especially with an Administration addicted to spending. 

In Paul Krugman’s world, deep structural problems can be solved simply by printing currency. I wonder whether he thinks all the Americans in debt should be given little basement printing presses to counterfeit away their troubles.

Krugman’s advice will appeal to his fans in government and academia, but won’t help the average American. If we dare to follow his lead, a Greek tragedy will be played out in American garb.

Truly is the Greatest Country in the World. Don't Let Freedom Slip Away

By: Kitty Werthmann 

What I am about to tell you is something you've probably never heard or will ever read in history books. 
  
I believe that I am an eyewitness to history.  I cannot tell you that Hitler took Austria by tanks and guns; it would distort history.  We elected him by a landslide - 98% of the vote.  I've never read that in any American publications.  Everyone thinks that Hitler just rolled in with his tanks and took Austria by force.

In 1938, Austria was in deep Depression.  Nearly one-third of our workforce was unemployed.  We had 25% inflation and 25% bank loan interest rates.

Farmers and business people were declaring bankruptcy daily.  Young people were going from house to house begging for food.  Not that they didn't want to work; there simply weren't any jobs.  My mother was a Christian woman and believed in helping people in need.  Every day we cooked a big kettle of soup and baked bread to feed those poor, hungry people - about 30 daily.

The Communist Party and the National Socialist Party were fighting each other.  Blocks and blocks of cities like Vienna, Linz, and Graz were destroyed.  The people became desperate and petitioned the government to let them decide what kind of government they wanted.

We looked to our neighbor on the north, Germany, where Hitler had been in power since 1933.  We had been told that they didn't have unemployment or crime, and they had a high standard of living.  Nothing was ever said about persecution of any group -- Jewish or otherwise.  We were led to believe that everyone was happy.  We wanted the same way of life in Austria . We were promised that a vote for Hitler would mean the end of unemployment and help for the family.  Hitler also said that businesses would be assisted, and farmers would get their farms back.  Ninety-eight percent of the population voted to annex Austria to Germany and have Hitler for our ruler.

We were overjoyed, and for three days we danced in the streets and had candlelight parades.  The new government opened up big field kitchens and everyone was fed.

After the election, German officials were appointed, and like a miracle, we suddenly had law and order.  Three or four weeks later, everyone was employed.  The government made sure that a lot of work was created through the Public Work Service.

  
Hitler decided we should have equal rights for women.  Before this, it was a custom that married Austrian women did not work outside the home.  An able-bodied husband would be looked down on if he couldn't support his family.  Many women in the teaching profession were elated that they could retain the jobs they previously had been required to give up for marriage.

Hitler Targets Education - Eliminates Religious Instruction for Children: 
  
Our education was nationalized.  I attended a very good public school.  The population was predominantly Catholic, so we had religion in our schools. The day we elected Hitler (March 13, 1938), I walked into my schoolroom to find the crucifix replaced by Hitler's picture hanging next to a Nazi flag. Our teacher, a very devout woman, stood up and told the class we wouldn't pray or have religion anymore.  Instead, we sang ""Deutschland, Deutschland, Uber Alles,"" and had physical education.

Sunday became National Youth Day with compulsory attendance.  Parents were not pleased about the sudden change in curriculum.  They were told that if they did not send us, they would receive a stiff letter of warning the first time.  The second time they would be fined the equivalent of $300, and the third time they would be subject to jail.  The first two hours consisted of political indoctrination.  The rest of the day we had sports.  As time went along, we loved it.  Oh, we had so much fun and got our sports equipment free.  We would go home and gleefully tell our parents about the wonderful time we had. 

My mother was very unhappy.  When the next term started, she took me out of public school and put me in a convent.  I told her she couldn't do that and she told me that someday when I grew up, I would be grateful.  There was a very good curriculum, but hardly any fun - no sports, and no political indoctrination.  I hated it at first but felt I could tolerate it.  Every once in a while, on holidays, I went home.  I would go back to my old friends and ask what was going on and what they were doing.  Their loose lifestyle was very alarming to me.  They lived without religion.  By that time unwed mothers were glorified for having a baby for Hitler.  It seemed strange to me that our society changed so suddenly.  As time went along, I realized what a great deed my mother did so that I wasn't exposed to that kind of humanistic philosophy.

Equal Rights Hits Home: 
  
In 1939, the war started and a food bank was established.  All food was rationed and could only be purchased using food stamps.  At the same time, a full-employment law was passed which meant if you didn't work, you didn't get a ration card, and if you didn't have a card, you starved to death. Women who stayed home to raise their families didn't have any marketable skills and often had to take jobs more suited for men.

Soon after this, the draft was implemented.  It was compulsory for young people, male and female, to give one year to the labor corps.  During the day, the girls worked on the farms, and at night they returned to their barracks for military training just like the boys.  They were trained to be anti-aircraft gunners and participated in the signal corps.  After the labor corps, they were not discharged but were used in the front lines.  When I go back to Austria to visit my family and friends, most of these women are emotional cripples because they just were not equipped to handle the horrors of combat.  Three months before I turned 18, I was severely injured in an air raid attack.  I nearly had a leg amputated, so I was spared having to go into the labor corps and into military service.  

Hitler Restructured the Family Through Daycare: 

  
When the mothers had to go out into the work force, the government immediately established child care centers.  You could take your children ages 4 weeks to school age and leave them there around-the-clock, 7 days a week, under the total care of the government.  The state raised a whole generation of children.  There were no motherly women to take care of the children, just people highly trained in child psychology.  By this time, no one talked about equal rights.  We knew we had been had.  

Health Care and Small Business Suffer Under Government Controls: 
  
Before Hitler, we had very good medical care.  Many American doctors trained at the University of Vienna .  After Hitler, health care was socialized, free for everyone.  Doctors were salaried by the government.  The problem was, since it was free, the people were going to the doctors for everything. When the good doctor arrived at his office at 8 a.m., 40 people were already waiting and, at the same time, the hospitals were full.  If you needed elective surgery, you had to wait a year or two for your turn.  There was no money for research as it was poured into socialized medicine.  Research at the medical schools literally stopped, so the best doctors left Austria and emigrated to other countries.

  
As for healthcare, our tax rates went up to 80% of our income.  Newlyweds immediately received a $1,000 loan from the government to establish a household.  We had big programs for families.  All day care and education were free.  High schools were taken over by the government and college tuition was subsidized.  Everyone was entitled to free handouts, such as food stamps, clothing, and housing. 

We had another agency designed to monitor business.  My brother-in-law owned a restaurant that had square tables.  Government officials told him he had to replace them with round tables because people might bump themselves on the corners.  Then they said he had to have additional bathroom facilities. It was just a small dairy business with a snack bar.  He couldn't meet all the demands.  Soon, he went out of business.  If the government owned the large businesses and not many small ones existed, it could be in control.

We had consumer protection.  We were told how to shop and what to buy.  Free enterprise was essentially abolished.  We had a planning agency specially designed for farmers.  The agents would go to the farms, count the live-stock, then tell the farmers what to produce, and how to produce it.

Ok... Let's explain some of the basic flaws here. You have a population of only 3,700,000...about the size of the Republic of Congo. Some in your population are still loyalists to the U.S as well. You are already occupied by an inordinate number of military facilities of your enemy. Among them, multiple air force bases, multiple army bases and even a resupply base network.

So here's a few things...The people at the bases aren't from Oklahoma...they are from all over the country and they don't care about your issues. They would probably be eager to live-fire their weapons, especially if you attack a base or something like that.

The U.S. doesn't even need to drive there...they are there already. The air bases in Oklahoma are capable of running missions half-way around the world and returning to base. There's enough firepower on these bases to reduce a large country to rubble in days.

You are literally surrounded by your opponent, bordered on all sides - a unique military situation.

Small countries can sometimes put up a little resistance when there are caves and mountains (like Afghanistan) or dense jungles (like Vietnam). Your state is flat, without many caves, and almost completely void of forest cover.

The U.S. won't even have to bring in supplies...one of the nation's ammunition plants is inside your borders. The McAlester Army Ammunition Plant manufactures and stores as well as manages even larger networks of ammunition and weapon supplies.

Shock 'n Awe will go down in about 10 to 20 minutes. Before the pilots even return to base for lunch your war will be over and your political status reduced to zero. The United States will likely strip you of congressmen and senators for at least a decade.

Something to consider, Oklahoma is a so-called ""taker"" state. For every $1 collected in taxes a $1.36 is allocated to your state from the U.S. Treasury. Yes...New Jersey, Connecticut, Nevada and others are keeping you afloat and helping pay your bills and take care of you. So considering the federal government does all this nice stuff for you and defends you from foreign states and imports and protects your international trade goods for you--considering all that, you should maybe not try to bite the hand that's feeding you. You're making off like bandits.

Finally, no international treaties exist between you and the United States. In this day and age you are risking a serious hazard. No weapons are off the table because you have no nuclear treaty with the U.S. With other recent adjustments to U.S. policy, the captured prisoners will likely have no access to habeas corpus or the Geneva Convention.

Economics,"Hey, about corporate taxes","What is the benefit of taxing corporations?  The price gets rolled into the cost of goods they produce, so the consumer pays them anyway, and by having them in the US we encourage businesses to find a lesser taxed country to set up shop.  What would be the problem if we eliminated corporate income tax?  Plus, by having them pay income tax, doesn't it give fodder to the argument that deserve certain citizen-like rights?  

My thinking is if we attract businesses, we get jobs.  We need jobs.  Even if, say, a French company just put a corporate shell to hold profits in america, that makes a few high paying jobs.  If exxon is making 1.21 jiggabucks a second in this country, isnt that better than exxon making 1.21 jiggabucks in the Caymans?

Please don't confuse this with deregulation and corpocratic nightmare, which it has seemed to devolve into when I asked some opinionated friends.

Dear [me],

""[A] gay judge's sexual preference will, without any question whatsoever, 'interfere with their job.' It's not possible for it to be otherwise... We simply should not elevate to the highest court in the land people who are known for engaging in sexually abnormal behavior which would technically make them felons in a quarter of the states over which they will have jurisdiction."" -- Bryan Fischer, American Family Association

Disqualified. 

That's what the American Family Association and Focus on the Family -- both right-wing religious organizations -- think of gays and lesbians potentially serving on the Supreme Court following the retirement of venerable liberal Justice John Paul Stevens.

Their outrageous position is that gays and lesbians are ""sinners"" and since character is a consideration in approving judges, they should be automatically disqualified.

Sexual orientation should NOT be a factor in the appointment of a Supreme Court justice. Period. 

With Focus on the Family, the American Family Association and the rest of the religious right firing up their massive lobbying machine, we need you to make your voice heard right now. Sign our letter to President Obama ASAP:

http://www.couragecampaign.org/NotAFactor

Last year, we thought that Focus on the Family -- the leading organization lobbying on behalf of the religious right -- might be turning over a page when they said being LGBT should not automatically disqualify someone from serving on the Supreme Court. 

But now Focus on the Family wants a ""do over"" because they still think gays and lesbians are unfit immoral sinners. Check out their latest statement:
""To be honest, this is one of those conversations we'd like to 'do over.' We can assure you that we recognize that homosexual behavior is a sin and does not reflect God's created intent and desire for humanity. Further, we at Focus do affirm that character and moral rectitude should be key considerations in appointing members of the judiciary, especially in the case of the highest court in the land.""
This truly scandalous attempt to marginalize and dehumanize LGBT people, shared by countless others in this country, is exactly why we need legislation like the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. And it is exactly why we need to draw attention to this discrimination.

It's time to take a stand and say no to discrimination, especially on the highest court in the land. Sign our letter to President Obama and invite your friends to join you now:

http://www.couragecampaign.org/NotAFactor

In the coming years, the Supreme Court will adjudicate several historic cases, including Perry v. Schwarzenegger -- the Prop 8 case that will soon be decided in federal district court. 

That's why it is so important that President Obama -- no matter the sexual orientation of his nominee -- gets this decision right.

Thanks for all you do in the name of equality.

politics,We have a Constitution to protect us from the abuses of government; so why do we trust government less than business?,"Looking back on the health care debate in America, and looking forward to the debate on Wall Street regulations, it seems that it is often posed in terms of the government versus business.  Government shouldn't involve itself in business, it is said; government shouldn't involve itself with the free market.  

When fears of ""death panels"" arose, it seemed to be only the far left commentators of cable news that pointed out that insurance companies already practiced something like the so-called death panels, revoking patients care or deeming it too costly (life time payout limits and such).  

We don't trust the government to censor speech, that's what the First Amendment is for.  But everyday we entrust to private broadcasters and publishers the power of censorship, who refuse to print such-and-such a material, and who has the supreme ""right"" to do so.  We don't trust the government to enter our homes, but my family recently received an ultimatum from our house insurance company to allow them to search our house or lose our policy.  If the government wanted to show that we were breaking our contract with them (the social contract, the law), they would need *some* evidence (probable cause) and even a search warrant in some cases to enter our home. But an insurance company can call us and hold our policy over our heads unless they can search our house with no cause other than they want to at this point?  Again, if the federal government decided to regularly/randomly search homes for evidence of breach of the (social) contract, this would be prohibited by the Fourth Amendment.

So my question is, and it is a genuine question, not trolling conservatives or libertarians or preaching to the choir, my question is: why, as Americans, distrust the government more than business?  Why have we come to believe that government==control and business/markets==freedom?

As this is going to the overarching philosophical debate of our country during the next election cycle I feel it is important to discuss these questions in a public forum.

EDIT:  Thanks for the good replies.  The question of legitimized violence (arrest, prison, etc) is a very important one for political thought.  In light of this, though, do you feel as though the Constitution and our laws are successful in minimizing the role of legitimized violence in America?  And if so, can you trust the government as a result?  If not, might we need a new Constitution and/or [Bill of Rights](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Bill_of_Rights)?

politics,A conversation with my grandfather regarding the Texas text book controversy.,"A few days ago me, my grandfather and my grandmother were enjoying my grandmothers 80th Birthday. My grandfather is a republican as well and my grandmother, I don't have any particular affiliation although I did vote for Obama in the last election. We were briefly talking about politics when I decided to mention the Texas State Board of Education's rewriting of history including the removal of the word democracy from the definition of our government. He stated to get hostile and defended the Texas SBoE by saying that we were a Republic before we were a democracy. I stated that he was not correct we have been and are a Constitutional Republican Democracy. I could sense that he did not like this line of conversation so I dropped it and we continued to have a more pleasant evening devoid of political discussion. I payed the bill, wished my grandmother a happy birthday, and continued on with my day. Unfortunately it has continued to bother me so I sent him this email today:


Republic or Democracy?

I wanted to send you this because you were talking about how our nation was a Republic before it was a Democracy. I wanted to express why I felt that the statement was not entirely correct. Originally the United States was a Constitutional Republic of Democratic States it is now a Federated Constitutional Republic of Democratic States. We have been and continue to be a Republican Democracy, with the exception that federal law now trumps State and locality laws. Allow me to explain. A Republic is a constitutional government with separation of powers in the form of Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches. There are two primary types of Democracy, Representative democracy and Direct democracy. The Legislative branch is what is considered to be Representative Democracy. The Central Government of the United States now and prior to the federalization of the central government was strictly a Representative democracy. Representative democracy is where the populace elects officials to create policies as a representative of the people. Direct democracy is where the populace drafts policies themselves with no interference and a popular vote determines passage of that policy. While the Central government is strictly a Representative democracy, the State is a combination of both since the populace can start a petition and call for a consensuses vote during election periods. Without the Legislative Branch or a petition system we would then be a strict republic with no democracy having only an Executive branch and a Judicial branch while maintaining a popular vote for the officials of the government and the Executive branch would then choose Senators. What has been the primary change since the founding of our government is the institution of federalism. Democracy has always been there as long as we have been a Republic because a Republic with a Legislative branch is a Democracy one inherits the attributes of the other. However, it goes farther than merely a Representative democracy. There are two types of Representative democracy, Parliamentary democracy and Liberal democracy. We are a Liberal democracy. I do of course refer to the term liberal in the classical sense not the sense it means today. For example Capitalism is considered to be market liberalism. Liberal meaning free. Now there are, separate from the mechanism of the inner workings of the government, multiple parties in alliance for political domination. The two major parties are called Republican and Democrat and the two parties have nothing to do with how this nation was founded, nor do their names reflect any meaning save what the observer associates with his personal view for his personal party and against the opposing party. If we are to look at the political parties of the Founding Fathers then we should start at the beginning. George Washington has no party association, indeed Washington was instead the line of division. To understand this we have to look at the make up of the Legislative branch, both Senate and House were divided into two groups, Pro-Administration and Anti-Administration. The sole basis of these parties were entirely based on whether they agreed or disagreed with George Washington. There were no Democrats or Republicans just people who agreed or disagreed with Washington. The first political party to come out of this was the Federalist party and most of the Federalist party were made up of the members of the Pro-Administration party. The first president with a declared political association was Alexander Hamilton who considered himself a Federalist. The party opposing the Federalist party was the Democratic-Republican party. Later both parties were dissolved and reformed into Republican and Democrat and have on occasion switched polarities and extremes. That is all I wanted to say.

Proposal of President Carlo Malinconico:the cost of a cafe on every internet connection. To help Publishing in black crisis, not helped by government policies.  
  
  
Rome - The publishers would pay one of the worst crises in its long history. This is underlined by the Italian Federation of Newspaper Publishers - Federazione Italiana Editori Giornali - (FIEG), in a study entitled The press in Italy 2007-2009 (La stampa in Italia 2007-2009), presented recently in the Globe Room (Sala del Mappamondo ) of the House.  
  
Data certainly not encouraging, evidence of an industry at risk, according to FIEG not helped by the government of Italy. ""The government has not only intervened to mitigate the effects of a critical juncture, and to release those structural problems that stifle the industry - says the study - but has the opposite effect, with the abolition of subsidized postal rates.  
  
Publishers have spoken thus measures not improperly defined as a heavy punishment for the industry. Since it would result in a ""heavy burden cost at a time when businesses are faced with a weakening domestic demand.""  
  
The study presented in the House has painted with dark strokes the present and future scenarios of publishing in the country of the Tricolor. The newspaper advertising has thus seen an increase of 0.6 percent, but arrived after the -16.4 percent for 2009. Regarding the sales, they have a daily record for minus 6 percent in the first three months of 2010  
  
The risks would be enormous, at least according to FIEG that suggested that the ""collapse of the great social and cultural heritage represented by plurality of voices in the Italian press. For its president, Carlo Malinconico, would not be possible to wait until the crisis passes by itself, but instead should move with urgency and with utmost determination.  
  
And here Malinconico threw on the table of discussions the seeds of a proposal that probably feed the flames of controversy. A small fee to be imposed on each network connection, which supports the sector as soon as it allows all the netizens to take advantage of online editorial content.  
  
The President of FIEG then cited the example of German, which provides a tax on every computer, but stressing that his intentions are of different kinds. ""A levy modest - Malinconico said - the cost of coffee a month or so, to bring a dowry of resources that can be helpful at this juncture.""  
  
And it wouldn't be a radical solution to the crisis - this Malinconico has admitted - but a ""transitory measure to be taken."" ""A lump-sum"" to swell the coffers of publishing in a crisis in sales, readers and advertisements. Why would pay the Internet for it? Plus with the ""cost of a cup of coffee a month or so""?  
  
Malinconico is back to talk about Google, tabout the know problem of vampires-search-engines. Two or three years announced by the President of FIEG to find a balance between publishers and search engine, in light of the investigation opened up by the same antitrust of Italy. ""And in the meantime what do we do?"" Asked itself Malinconico. ""Normally there are charges for certain services of general system are divided - he explained - Think of the electricity bills where you pay for the cost of hydroelectric power. ""Normally for certain services there are general system charges that are splitted - he explained - Think of the electricity bills where you pay for the cost of hydroelectric plant.",energy,2010-04-22,-0.0186650956173884

Economics,Chinese Yuan: To Peg or Not to Peg?,"While I attended an economic conference last week in Shanghai, I found it notable - but not surprising - that two former Secretaries of the Treasury, John Snow and Hank Paulson, as well as current Treasury Secretary Tim Geither, and former President George W. Bush were then in the country at the same time. The fact that so many key American power brokers (myself not included) were in China simultaneously is no coincidence. In an overly indebted world, the $2.5 trillion that China holds in foreign reserves is acting as a center of economic gravity, inexorably pulling all market participants into its orbit.

When a 10-ton elephant plods through a village of grass huts, the big question on everyone's mind is: which way is he going to turn next? With China, that fundamental question translates to guessing when Beijing will make changes to the value of the yuan. These decisions will determine the overall direction of the global economy, and will set the path that everyone must follow. Unfortunately, no Americans, even those who travel hat-in-hand to China, have a seat at the table where these decisions are being made.

At the risk of beating a dead horse, let me reiterate my central thesis with respect to currency valuation: just as it is always better to be rich than to be poor, it is always better to have a strong currency than a weak one. Although this simple maxim puts me into conflict with much of the economic establishment, I hold its truth to be...well...self-evident.

The effect of current Chinese currency policy (which, despite Beijing's protests to the contrary, is manipulation pure and simple) is to make the U.S. dollar more valuable and the yuan less valuable. As a result, the benefits of manipulation accrue to Americans, not the Chinese. We get pay raises; they get pay cuts. Americans use their stronger dollars to buy products they would otherwise not have been able to afford. On the flip side, the Chinese people do without products that they otherwise would have been able to afford had their government not transferred their purchasing power to us.

The same effect is experienced with interest rates. In order to manipulate the dollar's value higher, the Chinese government has gobbled up more than $1 trillion of them.The Chinese then loan the dollars back to the U.S. through purchases of government and mortgage-backed debt, which reduces the cost of servicing our massive liabilities.

By the same token, if China were to stop manipulating the dollar higher, it would remove the props currently supporting our dysfunctional economy. American interest rates and consumer prices would soar, and our economy would collapse. Meanwhile, China would experience the opposite effect. Chinese consumer prices would fall, immediately raising living standards for average Chinese workers, whose higher real wages would finally allow them to fully enjoy the fruits of their labor.

What strikes me as particularly dangerous is that no one, not even the Chinese, appear to understand these fundamental dynamics. All of the Shanghainese with whom I spoke last week were unaware that a stronger yuan would be in their own best interest. The way most people see it, a stronger currency is a bullet that China must be prepared to take in order to save the rest of the world from further pain.

And so we watch the strange spectacle of China stubbornly resisting actions from which it will immediately and substantially benefit. In reality, an appreciating yuan is the bitter medicine Americans must swallow if our sick economy is every to regain its health. (An allegorical explanation of this is contained in my new illustrated book, ""How an Economy Grows and Why it Crashes."")

When Beijing finally comes to it senses, the transition will be unavoidably disruptive. For China, the long-term growth would far outweigh the short-term shock. America, however, would face a much less certain outcome. There is no question that, for Americans, the immediate effects would be very painful, with the gains only developing with time and prudent decision-making. Still, that does not mean we should resist the process, for the longer it is delayed, the more severe the pain and the longer the road back to prosperity.

Given this reality, why are our political leaders so adamant that China effectively pull the rug out from under our economy? Are they really that clueless? Perhaps they are - or perhaps they are a bit more devious. Perhaps they are using reverse psychology. Maybe they feel that the best way to get the Chinese to maintain the peg is to demand that they remove it. Historically, the Chinese have always resisted outside interference.

However, to paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, you cannot fool all of the Chinese all of the time. Soon they will see the light, and when they do, it's lights out for American hegemony. If you think China is important today, just wait a few years. For example, while the Chinese automobile market is now the largest in the world, 90% of Chinese car buyers pay cash. In contrast, only 15% of American car buyers do so. In other words, Chinese consumers can actually afford their cars, while most Americans cannot. Without huge car payments, Chinese consumers are in much better shape not only to trade up to newer cars in the future, but to purchase other products as well. This suggests huge future growth, not only in automobiles but also in other consumer products as well.

This eruption of consumer demand, made possible by pent-up savings, is creating historic opportunities for investors. When the Chinese start using their wealth to expand their own economy rather than to subsidize ours, infrastructure may well be a primary beneficiary. (For more information on this, see Euro Pacific's new special report: Investing in China's Infrastructure.)

Whenever the Chinese government decides to end the peg, the Chinese economy will benefit as a result. While as citizens we can hope that U.S. leaders respond with the right policies to enable our economy to regain its former glory, as investors we should position ourselves to benefit from the more certain outcome.",finance,2010-04-26,0.227869678064247

hardware,Recommendations for reliable home printer?,"Apologies if this gets asked much here - I haven't found a post on this via SearchReddit. 

Would like your recommendations for a **very reliable** light-duty home printer. Use is perhaps a couple of dozen pages per week, with the occasional 100 or 200 page document. 

I've owned a number of printers in the last decade and every one of them was basically junk after the first year and was literally junked after two or three years. If the other hardware that I use in my life was this bad I'd probably be dead by now. 

Number-one problem is paper not feeding - every printer that I've owned has required paper to be hand-fed after a year or so of use. 

For a household of non-techies who have neither the expertise, interest, or time to baby-sit a touchy printer. About twice a year we have a total psychotic breakdown around here when somebody needs to print out something important *now* and printer is not cooperating.

politics,My (misguided and poorly thought out) plan for immigration reform,"So here is how I see it; there are 3 relatively simple things we can do to limit immigration.



**#1 (formerly #2)**: As we are closing up our borders, we take aim at employers who exploit them. Fine, or jail, or close businesses that knowingly hire illegals. Fine, or jail businesses that unknowingly hire illegals (there are a lot of them). Human trafficking and exploitation are huge crimes in a America, why are people getting away with it? If these fold, then there will be other companies to take their place. For those arguing that existing Americans won't do the work: a) there are legal immigrants who already do this thankless labor, and b) without illegal workers to artificially suppress wages, companies would have to pay more, which makes that work seem more palatable. And c) more taxable income that is not being sent out of the country which we can use for say, paying off 1.5 incredibly idiotic wars. (Personally I support the motivation behind both wars, but neither the planning, nor the means with which we did it).

2: Now that fewer people, from whatever nation, are coming in illegally we actively enforce our new employment laws by forcing all employers and businesses to make sure that their employees are legal, or citizens.

3: Finish that whopping fence; and patrol the border, including cameras and drones (some of that is being done now). It keeps being called expensive, and it is, but it's a small price to pay, if all those public education, health care, lost taxes, and whatnot figures are true. **Various reports, both Rightwing and Leftists have estimated the cost in the tens of billions of dollars in either misspent or lost income, finishing and equipping the fence/wall/thing would be cheaper than to continue throwing good money after bad.**



Now the secondary steps. These are to be taken at the same time, not an after the fact, or before the fact.

1: All immigrants with children legitimately born within the US or its territories may remain. Anyone who has been here for more than 10 years, may remain. Anyone who requires care from their family (old folks, medical disabilities) may remain. These people will face no retroactive fines, and will take all steps to becoming citizens. If they fail to do so, then they can be deported.

2: All citizens regardless of race or place of origin will be required to carry and ID at all times (we **do** already though it is not required of us). We may be asked for them **during and ongoing investigation for which we are a suspect**, and not having one will result in a fingerprint check (most of us have these already through either government jobs, cub scouts, boy scouts, previous crimes, bank accounts or whatever) and a small fine to pay for the service ($25-50). If the status is in limbo (ongoing citizenship classes or suit) or legal (citizen, work visa or tourism visa) you are **merely under investigation for the original crime. This does not apply to petty crimes like jaywalking or small item theft, but would be applicable for traffic violations.**

3: we prevent loss of business by: A) tax breaks to those companies that manufacture/produce in America at fare compensation before being required to by law. We lose the tax income from the company, but make it back later. But it allows them to invest in their infrastructure and training. B) We place heavy handed (unfair really) restrictions on companies who use unfair payment and employment practices. No pussyfooting about boycotts for sweat shops. You use child labor, you can*not* export to the US. We place sanctions on countries, why not companies?

Common sense (but not really all that common): An expensive purge and reorganization should be short lived. After we have ""cleaned house"" (a terrible metaphor) there should be no reason for a large force to maintain it. Border patrol could even be lessened after the fence and appropriate patrols are in place. Local, state and federal agents would have the ability to detain and being deportation proceedings without a specialized department of US Purity or some such neofacist garbage.

We would also need to revise our existing naturalization policies to allow for easier transition without allowing ""everyone"" in. I don't mean this by race, but by possible criminal history (in context; if someone was caught stealing bread or fighting slavery or something, they can be let in. Mass murderers and whoever, gtfo.)

Am I missing anything? Does this sound too right wing? I tried to keep it pretty centrist and fair without either letting businesses off the hook or blaming Mexicans (who aren't the only illegals) for things like my bad eyesight.

politics,Why Should We Trust the Government to Protect the Environment?,"* The government is nothing more than a coercive monopoly. The government uses coercion, force, and violence to establish and maintain barbaric power over society, as well as, using this coercion, force, and violence to establish a monopoly privilege status in society.

* Due to the monopoly privilege status that the government enjoys, the govertnment lacks any serious competition in the field of environmental protection. If the government fails in their job of protecting the environment, resources continue to be allocated to the government to protect the environment. If another organization fails in their job of protecting the environment, society can begin to shift resources away from this organization to another organization doing a better job at protecting the environment. This continual and ever increasing stream of resources insulates the government from market forces that spur innovation, efficiency, and effectiveness. 

* Big Business owns Big Government. Do I really need to add anything further to illustrate this? 

* Most pollution occurs on government property or property that the government asserts direct authority over, on government lands, and in government rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans.

* The government pollutes it's own property. Here is how David Armstrong summarized the situation in a 1999 Boston Globe series: 
&gt;The United States government, which acts as steward and protector of the nation's environment, is itself the worst polluter in the land.
&gt;Federal agencies have contaminated more than 60,000 sites across the country and the cost of cleaning up the worst sites is officially expected to approach $300 billion, nearly five times the price of similar destruction caused by private companies. . . . 
&gt;Nearly every military base and nuclear arms facility in the country is contaminated. The pollution extends from the US Mint, which released hazardous chemicals into the air when producing commemorative coins, to the national parks, where leaky oil tanks and raw sewage are polluting pristine rivers.
&gt;Even the Environmental Protection Agency [EPA], charged with enforcing the country's environmental laws, has been fined for violating toxic waste laws at its laboratories. At the EPA's lab in Lexington, for example, mercury was discovered leaching into the ground water three years ago.

* Government policies directly harm the environment, such as ethanol mandates, prohibitions on hemp, drug prohibition, subsidizing harmful practices, etc.

Updates/Notes: I am not suggesting that the environment doesn't need protection, it clearly does. I am just suggesting that the government is one of the worst organizations for this task, due to the factors I listed above.",energy,2010-04-30,-0.5643002390468596

investing,Isn't it obvious what happened on Thursday? (OPINION),"We've all heard the stories about those numerous NON-PENNY stocks that sold at penny levels on Thursday.  To me, it's pretty obvious what happened.

The U.S. government must have instructed some of the largest volume traders (institutional traders) to **dump large volumes of those stocks at penny levels,** right at 2:38PM Eastern Time on Thursday, in an orchestrated effort to **drive down key U.S. stock market indices and thereby dramatically devalue the U.S. stock market.**

Objection #1:  Wouldn't those institutions lose (a combined) billions of dollars by dumping those stocks at penny levels?  Yes, indeed they would.  But I believe that **the U.S. Federal Reserve promised to recoup those institutions whatever losses they incurred.**

Objection #2:   It's no secret that China (among other countries) has been trying to ""slow down"" its economy, to stop ts currency from being too quickly devalued.  **Is it so hard to imagine, then, that the U.S. would want to do the same thing -- only more covertly?**  The U.S. dollar has been severely devalued recently.  Until this week, that is!

One has to wonder which firms GAINED from all of of these U.S. stocks being sold off at penny levels.  I suspect they could have been Chinese investors.  In other words, it's very possible that China just took a gigantic windfall profit at the expense of the U.S. stock market, **precisely when they didn't want to take one!**

Did the U.S.'s ""market manipulation capabilities"" just assert its dominance over Chinese market manipulation capabilities?  I know it seems counter-intuitive, but so does the idea of slowing down your own economy in order to bolster your currency.

I would not be at all surprised to see this ""currency warfare"" continue for months, until the big Chinese firms learn how to fight back.  Thursday just proved that American innovation is leaps and bounds ahead of the Chinese in regards to market and currency manipulation.

Economics,Market Crash Result of Japanese Central Bank.,"While you will not read this in the MSM the root cause of the market anomaly on Thursday was the Japanese central bank.

Let me quickly walk through this.

1.Japan has for the last twenty years had excessively low interest rates. For the sake of easy math lets say 0%.


2.Traders,Hedge Funds etc will take use of these low rates by borrowing YEN. Let us say 100 YEN, so that in the future I will be required to payback that 100 YEN.


3. I take my borrowed 100 YEN and convert into a Foreign Currency, say USD. Suppose 1 Dollar is worth 100 Yen.


4. I now take my 1 Dollar and invest in something like, I don't know the S&amp;P.


5. Now even if the S&amp;P goes up I will be exposed to exchange rate risk, in so far as in the future 1 Dollar may only be worth 50 YEN. So that I have to make more money in the future to payback my loan in yen.


Thursday more than likely was a result of pressure on the EURO. We saw JPY strengthen against USD. So all the people who had purchased US Stocks with borrowed JPY were forced to sell of Stock to cover their currency exposure.

So the root cause in some sense was the profligate spending of the Greeks and low interest rates of Japan.

More regulations are sham in that the root causes are not addressed.",finance,2010-05-09,-0.0944687708577828

Economics,Is Sovereign Debt Crisis Contained to Subprime?,"As Americans observe the chaos in Greece, most assume that the strength of our currency, the credit worthiness of our government, and the vast expanse of two oceans, will prevent a similar scene from playing out in our streets. I believe these protections to be illusory.

Once again the vast majority fails to see a crisis in the making, even as it stares at them from close range. Just as market observers in 2007 told us that the credit crisis would be confined to the subprime mortgage market, current analysts tell us that sovereign debt problems are confined to Greece, Spain, Portugal, and perhaps Italy. They were wrong then, and I believe that they're wrong now.

During the housing boom, subprime and prime borrowers made many of the same mistakes. Both groups overpaid for their homes, bought with low or no down payments, financed using ARMs instead of fixed rate mortgages, and repeatedly cashed out appreciated home equity through re-financings. The market largely overlooked the glaring similarities, and instead merely focused on FICO scores. Yes, prime borrowers had better credit, but their losses on underwater properties were no less devastating. As the magnitude of home price declines intensified, prime borrowers defaulted in levels that were almost as high as the subprime crowd.

So when mortgage backed securities started to go bad, it wasn't as if the problems emanated in subprime and subsequently ""contaminated"" the rest of the market. All borrowers were infected with the same disease, but the symptoms merely expressed themselves sooner in subprime. The same is true on a national level, whereby Greece plays the part of the subprime borrower.

Though the U.S. is considered to be the highest order of ""prime"" borrower, based on historic precedent, our debt to GDP levels are at crisis levels, and are not that much lower than Portugal or Spain. When off-budget and contingency liabilities are properly accounted for, one could argue that we are already in worse financial shape than Greece.

Most importantly, like Greece (and homeowners who relied on adjustable rate mortgages), we have a high percentage of short-term debt that is vulnerable to rising rates. The one key difference is that while Greece borrows in euros, a currency it cannot print, America borrows in dollars, which we can print endlessly. In reality however, this is a distinction with very little substantive difference.

What if Greece had not been a member of the euro zone and had instead borrowed in their former currency, the drachma? First, given its past history of fiscal shortfalls, Greece would not have been able to borrow nearly as much as it had (They may well have been forced to borrow in euros anyway).

Under those circumstances, creditors would have been more reluctant to lend without the possibility of a German led bailout. Had Greece never adopted the euro as its currency, but nevertheless borrowed in euros, it would now face the same difficult choices, but would not be offered the carrots or sticks provided by other euro zone nations that are worried about the integrity of their currency. The IMF would have been Greece's only possible savior.

Many of our top economists now argue that all would be well in Greece if the country was in charge of its own currency. In such a scenario, Greece would indeed have had no problems printing as many drachmas needed to pay its debts. However, would this really be a ""get out of debt free"" card for Greece?

The main reason the Greeks are protesting in the streets is that they do not want their benefits reduced or taxes raised to repay foreign creditors. But despite the likely domestic popularity of a drachma-printing policy, would it really get the Greeks off the hook? They would stiff their creditors by repaying them in currency of diminished value.

But the same result could be achieved through an honest debt restructuring, which would involve ""haircuts"" for all creditors. In a restructuring, the pain falls most squarely on those who foolishly lent money to a ""subprime"" borrower.

But with inflation it's not just foreign creditors who would suffer. Every Greek citizen who has savings in drachma would suffer. Every Greek citizen who works for wages would suffer. Sure nominal benefits are preserved and taxes are not raised, but real purchasing power is destroyed. If the cost of living goes up, the reduction in the value of government benefits is just as real.

Of course, the negative effects on the economy of run-a-way inflation and skyrocketing interest rates are worse than what otherwise might result from an honest restructuring or even out right default. It is just amazing how few economists understand this simple fact.

Just because we can inflate does not mean we can escape the consequences of our actions. One way or another the piper must be paid. Either benefits will be cut or the real value of those benefits will be reduced. In fact, it is precisely because we can inflate our problems away that they now loom so large. With no one forcing us to make the hard choices, we constantly take the easy way out.

When creditors ultimately decide to curtail loans to America, U.S. interest rates will finally spike, and we will be confronted with even more difficult choices than those now facing Greece. Given the short maturity of our national debt, a jump in short-term rates would either result in default or massive austerity. If we choose neither, and opt to print money instead, the run-a-way inflation that will ensue will produce an even greater austerity than the one our leaders lacked the courage to impose.

Those who believe rates will never rise as long as the Fed remains accommodative, or that inflation will not flare up as long as unemployment remains high, are just as foolish as those who assured us that the mortgage market was sound because national real estate prices could never fall.",finance,2010-05-09,-0.5070540610561736

politics,"So I just read the Arizona immigration bill (SB1070) and was surprised to see something entirely different from what Reddit and many on the Left describe.  I'm typically a staunch Liberal, but would like to have a discussion on this. (More in text)","To start, I would consider myself very liberal.  I'm a big supporter of the President, but wish he would do more (close Guantanamo already, push a more comprehensive health care bill, end DADT, get us out of these ridiculous wars, etc).  I usually find myself angry at the ""information"" conservatives spew.  It all seems very conniving and just plain evil.  However, I think that the new Arizona SB1070 bill is being harshly misrepresented by the Left.  At the risk of being downvoted, I'd like to share my opinions and have an honest conversation about the text of the bill.




I recommend that anyone interested read the bill [here](http://www.azleg.gov/legtext/49leg/2r/bills/sb1070s.pdf).  As far as I see, the bill for the most part reinforces Federal law that is already in place.  At NO point does it ever ask for one's ""papers,"" only identification.  I thought having ID was a law already[I have since found out I was wrong about this. See below].  Let's stop this nonsense about officers running around saying, ""Papers please!""  It's simply not true.  With the law, it does say that an officer can question someone's status if they have reasonable suspicion.  However, there are clear cases when this suspicion arises.  This is by no means a term invented by the Arizona legislature.  If a person driving a vehicle is pulled over for speeding, doesn't have ID on them, and evades the officer's questions, this is more what they are talking about.  At no point can an office bother and arrest any random person on the street.  To add, ""the attorney general or county
attorney shall not investigate complaints that are based solely on race, color or national origin.""  Racial profiling is clearly denoted as illegal under the bill.  I do have concerns that officers misunderstanding the bill may participate in such profiling, but to say the bill explicitly says that is simply false.  IMO, if we want to debate the merits of the bill, we should be honest about the text.  Personally, I think we must put more emphasis on fining businesses who hire illegals.  I also believe we must make it easier for people to legally immigrate to our nation.  However, whether illegals help or hurt the economy, they are still here illegally--undocumented.  





**TL;DR:**  While I have my reservations, I think much of the arguments against the Arizona immigration bill are founded on a series of untruths and talking points.  I know I'll probably be downvoted to oblivion, but I'd like to have an honest conversation about the bill, and about the US immigration system going forward.




**EDIT: SOME THINGS I'VE LEARNED**
Thank you Reddit.  For the most part, this has been an interesting discussion bringing to light some important issues.  Here are some updates regarding information I have learned and some other general comments:


-The bill is practically a mirror of Federal immigration law.



-Illegal immigration in Arizona is a serious problem that has to be resolved.  The Federal government must take appropriate action.


-We should not just single out illegals.  We should impose large penalties on businesses that hire illegals.


-We must make legal immigration much easier.


-I never said I was necessarily happy about this bill.  I do, however, feel that it is being severely misrepresented by the media, Reddit, liberals, etc. for political reasons..and I am a liberal on pretty much every other issue.


-I do not believe the bill is racist.  The text of the bill specifically prohibits any racial profiling.  If an officer is following the law, I see few issues.  That being said, I understand cops are not the most trustworthy people in the world.  However, I think we must look through the text of the bill before we judge it.  I do, however, feel Arizona has a history of racism including the recent laws (ban on ethnic studies, wtf?) 


-The law says that one does not have to have ID on them at all times (I was wrong about what I originally thought), however, he must identify himself (name/address) if an officer asks.",finance,2010-05-14,-0.2317745410497757

worldnews,How would a 'World Reserve Bank' work?,"At one time, when the US economy was much less integrated with the economies of other countries, the National Debt amounted to a bookkeeping entry at the Federal Reserve, and had very little to do with reality.

I was just thinking - if a World Reserve Bank had the same function with regard to all national economies, it would act as a giant capacitor to the global financial network, allocating debt to all countries as seemed best for both that country and the global economy at a given time.  Its own debt would not have to be owed to anybody, so it could have an essentially unlimited debt balance.  It would just be subject to an approval process regarding the limit, and managed as an inflation control.  So it would be able to maintain a Keynesian debt financed growth model for the whole world.   This is an extremely weird concept to me.

Economics,Real VS. CPI Inflation,"My question to the Economics Subreddit is:
If Gold is a indicator of what savings is worth in real terms to cost of goods as many claim, then wouldn't the increase of gold and silver percent be a better indicator of what inflation is or will be in the same time period? In other words looking at the spot market of gold and silver increases of GOLD(http://www.kitco.com/): 30daychg: +74.20 +6.43% and 1yearchg: +303.30 + 32.76% &amp; SILVER(http://www.kitcosilver.com/): 30daychg: +.76 +4.13% 1yearchg: +5.13 +36.51% be more of what goods will be rising in the near future to offset the pressure of the weakening dollar? Considering the dollar is weakening overall concurrently with other fiat currencies and prices of gold and silver have increased significantly compared to CPI or despite the USD index strengthening. Is the illusion on for those unwary to see that REAL inflation is going to be much higher than what is stated from the FED, CBO, GAO, etc.??",finance,2010-05-14,0.1523992338359013

Subject: Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. I want to explain SB 1070
I'm Arizona State Senator Sylvia Allen. I want to explain SB 1070 which I voted for and was just signed by Governor Jan Brewer.
Rancher Rob Krantz was murdered by the drug cartel on his ranch a month ago. I participated in a senate hearing two weeks ago on the border violence, here is just some of the highlights from those who testified.

The people who live within 60 to 80 miles of the Arizona/Mexico Border have for years been terrorized and have pleaded for help to stop the daily invasion of humans who cross their property . One Rancher testified that 300 to 1200 people a DAY come across his ranch vandalizing his property, stealing his vehicles and property, cutting down his fences, and leaving trash. In the last two years he has found 17 dead bodies and two Koran bibles.

Another rancher testified that daily drugs are brought across his ranch in a military operation. A point man with a machine gun goes in front, 1/2 mile behind are the guards fully armed, 1/2 mile behind them are the drugs, behind the drugs 1/2 mile are more guards. These people are violent and they will kill anyone who gets in the way. This was not the only rancher we heard that day that talked about the drug trains.

One man told of two illegal's who came upon his property one shot in the back and the other in the arm by the drug runners who had forced them to carry the drugs and then shot them. Daily they listen to gun fire during the night it is not safe to leave his family alone on the ranch and they can't leave the ranch for fear of nothing being left when they come back.

The border patrol is not on the border. They have set up 60 miles away with check points that do nothing to stop the invasion. They are not allowed to use force in stopping anyone who is entering. They run around chasing them, if they get their hands on them then they can take them back across the border.

Federal prisons have over 35% illegal's and 20% of Arizona prisons are filled with illegal's. In the last few years 80% of our law enforcement that have been killed or wounded have been by an illegal.

The majority of people coming now are people we need to be worried about. The ranchers told us that they have seen a change in the people coming they are not just those who are looking for work and a better life.

The Federal Government has refused for years to do anything to help the border states . We have been over run and once they are here we have the burden of funding state services that they use. Education cost have been over a billion dollars. The healthcare cost billions of dollars. Our State is broke, $3.5 billion deficit and we have many serious decisions to make. One is that we do not have the money to care for any who are not here legally. It has to stop.
The border can be secured. We have the technology we have the ability to stop this invasion. We must know who is coming and they must come in an organized manner legally so that we can assimilate them into our population and protect the sovereignty of our country. We are a nation of laws. We have a responsibility to protect our citizens and to protect the integrity of our country and the government which we live under.

I would give amnesty today to many, but here is the problem, we dare not do this until the Border is secure. It will do no good to forgive them because thousands will come behind them and we will be over run to the point that there will no longer be the United States of America but a North American Union of open borders. I ask you what form of government will we live under? How long will it be before we will be just like Mexico , Canada or any of the other Central American or South American countries? We have already lost our language, everything must be printed in Spanish also. We have already lost our history it is no longer taught in our schools. And we have lost our borders. 

The leftist media has distorted what SB 1070 will do. It is not going to set up a Nazi Germany . Are you kidding. The ACLU and the leftist courts will do everything to protect those who are here illegally, but it was an effort to try and stop illegal's from setting up businesses, and employment, and receiving state services and give the ability to local law enforcement when there is probable cause like a traffic stop to determine if they are here legally. Federal law is very clear if you are here on a visa you must have your papers on you at all times. That is the law. In Arizona all you need to show you are a legal citizen is a driver license, MVD identification card, Native American Card, or a Military ID. This is what you need to vote, get a hunting license, etc.. So nothing new has been added to this law. No one is going to be stopped walking down the street etc... The Socialist who are in power in DC are angry because we dare try and do something and that something the Socialist wants us to do is just let them come. They want the ""Transformation"" to continue.

Maybe it is too late to save America . Maybe we are not worthy of freedom anymore. But as an elected official I must try to do what I can to protect our Constitutional Republic . Living in America is not a right just because you can walk across the border. Being an American is a responsibility and it comes by respecting and upholding the Constitution the law of our land which says what you must do to be a citizen of this country.

Economics,I will have a meeting with Ben Bernanke on 5/20/2010 .  Place your questions for him here.,"I have a meeting with the Fed Chairman.  It will be a semi-formal discussion with about 40 people.  There will be plenty of time for Q&amp;A after his remarks.  Our focus will be on serious policy measures, rather than a glorified tour (which I would hope the Chairman would not waste time on).

We have unique access to him as a favor, so I won't ask/pass on any non-polite or pressing questions.  That does not mean I will throw him softballs.  For example: *Why are you so afraid of an audit?  What are you hiding?*  (Bad).  *Would a one-time (rather than regular) audit of the Fed assuage your fears of piercing the wall of independence the fed needs, and if so, in what ways could an such an audit be done to avoid your objections?* (Good).  *Dude, where do you buy your suits?* (Bad).  *What do you personally feel the chances are of stability in the Banking sector after their bailouts, without the passage of reform like re-enactment of Glass-Steagal?* (Good).

I'll record the highest-rated questions to present with any remaining time after the meeting, and share the answers here (if able). I'm not sure whether the meeting will be off-the-record or not, so I'll also avoid details about how we gained access.


Edit: I just got back from the meeting.  We actually got to hold it in the FOMC board room.  I'll do a writeup in a bit.",finance,2010-05-19,0.0455723055226011

Economics,Could summer 2010 reprise summer 1931?,"This takes forward the argument of an earlier [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c3hzt/greece_must_leave_the_euro_people_are_not_seeing/), which essentially said that Greece cannot grow within the EMU. It must default/restructure and re-issue the drachma. Saying, ""Oh, too difficult!"" is not good enough. The costs of exit are vastly outweighed by the costs of staying on the euro. Crying, ""But the markets will never lend to Greece again!"" is also rubbish. Markets have a short-term memory, and in fact Greece as a sovereign borrower will be *more* attractive post-default (because of a lighter debt load). A good example in recent memory is Argentina. When the situation turned adverse (Asia crisis, 1997), everyone told it to keep to the currency board (i.e. 1-for-1 peg to USD). It did so for four painful years, suffering contracting GDP. Finally, at end-2001, it devalued and defaulted. Growth rocketed to 7.5% and stayed there till the recent global downturn. 

Another precedent for the Greek tragedy is the Great Depression. The point of my original thread was that the medicine being prescribed during the Depression was austerity. And countries took it to varying degrees. What I want to do now is lay out the pathways from this point forward, if we take 1931 as a precedent. 

Why 1931? Because the fit is uncanny. The global business cycle peaked in 1928, three years before 1931. Likewise, the cyclical peak this time was three years ago: 2007. As the cycle turns down, the weakest links start to go 'pop'. This time, Dubai comes to mind, but I'm sure I'm overlooking some others. In the 1929+ downturn, it was the agricultural exporters: Australia, Argentina, and others in Latin America. But it didn't end there. The crisis moved closer to the 'core' of the world economy, with the common denominator being net debtor status. This is where continental Europe came into the firing line, and it is where Club Med enters today. 

(I AM SKIPPING OVER VAST SWATHES OF THE STORY, YES. These might be worth coming back to later.) 

At May 1931 the world stood on the precipice. By the end of the year, the global economy had taken the key steps toward splitting into three distinct groups. The choices were:

* stay the course (keep on the gold standard, but with tariffs)
* retreat to autarky (government authorisation for any trade transaction)
* devalue (introduce tariffs but still remain part of the open world trade system)

Those who chose the first option were the ones who could *afford* to. They were net creditors and were basically quite competitive at the exchange rates prevailing on the cusp of the Great Depression. This was France, Netherlands, Switzerland and a few others, and was known as the 'gold bloc'. 

The ones which suffered the biggest political upheavals in the course of austerity (Germany, Hungary, and others) chose the autarky path. They were also net debtors and imposed capital controls in part to marshal all available foreign exchange for the repayment of sovereign debt. 

The rest -- a mixture of creditors and debtors -- left the gold standard, which means they devalued. The defaults were mostly of the form of paying you back in a depreciated currency, rather than violating the coupon or principle or schedule. 

* Group 3 performed the best during the rest of the decade. Group 1 performed the worst -- their currency was increasingly overvalued with time and their economies uncompetitive. Germany (in Group 2) grew strongly. What Group 2 and 3 had in common was leaving the gold standard; Group 3 stayed plugged into the world economy, Group 2 unplugged. 
* If this story is anything to go by, Club Med are not going to follow the gold bloc route. They can't afford it. Only Germany and Northern Europe can do that. And they well might, which is bad news for them and for us. Club Med and the Eastern accession members of the EU have to choose between the Autarky and Tariff routes. 
* The devaluations during the Great Depression were an aid to growth. However, what really got the global economy going again was the USA devaluation 1933 and resolute German expansion (also 1933). The Gold Bloc finally joined the party with devaluations in 1935-36, but too tentatively and anyway too late: The US again staged a horrific downturn, when Congress tightened the fiscal position by 2.5 percentage points of GDP, the Fed twice increased the reserve ratio, and the Treasury sterilised gold inflows. 
* Interestingly: the countries which had devalued around 1931 (some earlier, some later) had by this time (1937) built up such huge reserves that they could ride out the US recession by spending down those reserves -- no resort to austerity (and almost no devaluations). 

EDIT:
Just a quick caution against hysteria. Yes, the issue is important. But the point is to wake people up to (what I see as) the ""right"" course of action. I do not subscribe to any kind of fatalism about history. What I want is for the EU to do the right thing, which is to help Greece and any other incongruous members of EMU to leave the monetary union, but stay in the EU. I want debt forgiveness instead of moral grandstanding. People accusing Greeks of being lazy/corrupt/freespending might be living in glass houses.

politics,"Dear People of the Internet, please please please consider this before you jump on the Rand Paul bashing band wagon.","It seems like we are all forgetting about the unprecedented and amazing support that Rand Paul's father got from the internet in October-December 2007. 

In case you are not aware, Ron Paul became an internet phenomenon, raised the most money out of any republican candidate and became adored by thousands and thousands of people from all kinds of different backgrounds.  

Many different things attracted us to his cause: 

* His consistent criticism of and call to keep the Federal Reserve in check.
* Wanting to end the wars and stop getting tangled up in the affairs of other countries.
* Wanting to end the war on drugs and legalize marijuana.
* His defense of privacy, wanting to repeal the patriot act and re-instate habeas corpus.
* His commitment to the constitution in a time when Bush and Cheney were trampling all over it.

Essentially, Ron Paul is a staunch libertarian and an honest one.  Even though very few of his followers agreed with everything he believes, we still loved one or two things that he stood for and were willing to respect his other opinions.  This is the vibe that I got from observing all of the Ron Paul mania.  
Us followers loved him: he had balls, he was honest, he was an underdog, the mainstream media wouldn't give him hardly any of the attention that he deserved, Fox News didn't like him and made him look like an idiot on several occasions.

The Internet's support was great: It raised tons of money and held Ron Paul rallies  (THE ORIGINAL TEA PARTIES).  It even got a fucking blimp.

Then January 2009 came along, Paul didn't get the votes he needed and then Ron Paul ReLOVEution faded away.   

Fast forward to Obama's rise to power: Glenn Beck, and Fox News hijacked and mutated this tea party movement and turned it into a monster.  I think it is fucking tragic that Rand and Ron Paul are now being lumped in with the Limbaugh/Palin/Beck/Fox/Misspelled-Signs Tea Partiers.  They are not the same.  

Regarding Rand's Statements about the Civil Rights Act:

In 2007/8 we all knew Ron Paul's beliefs were a bit odd: It should not be a surprise to anyone that the Pauls think the 10th item of the Civil Rights act is flawed.  Of Course they think its Flawed!!  They're libertarians! 

It makes total sense that a libertarian would believe that private business should have the right to be racist.  They believe that the free market and local government would do a better job of keeping racist business owners in check than the federal government would.  Do I agree with this?  No because I think that without this federal act, there would probably still be some Alabama restaurants with a ""White's Only"" sign on the door.  But ever since I watched [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8BB3NrSpRGE#t=0m48s)^ the Pauls will always be heros to me and I respect how consistent they are with their libertarian values.

It seems like the very people who supported his dad 2.5 years are turning against Rand Paul.  **Please think before you jump on this band wagon.**

**tl;dr**  The internet loved Ron Paul back in 2007 during the republican primaries.  This is when the original tea parties started.  Fox hijacked this movement and mutated it.  Rand Paul has all the same principles and beliefs that his father has, but we are unfortunately lumping him in with beck, palin, fox and company and we should not be.  Also, his statement about the civil rights act should not surprise anyone and is not offensive if you understand why a libertarian would believe it is flawed.

Edit: I re-wrote some stuff to make it clearer and more readable.

^I still get goosebumps when I watch that clip.  For six years I never expected anyone to ever say what he said on national television.

politics,AskPolitics: The ideal state?,"I don't know about you, but every time I read an article about:

- A corporate identity doing something bad
- A government identity doing something bad
- A religious identity doing something bad
- A social/communal identity doing something bad

I feel that our system is broken.  How would you envision the ideal state? What would reddit agree on? I think this would be a good discussion.

I've thought a lot about the ideal system, this is what I've gathered.

As far as religion:

- No religion, because it's too close minded and creates a cult behavior that excludes and mistreats outsiders. 
- No extreme atheism, because I've seen how atheist based nations such as China and USSR (and modern Russia) treat human beings, and are usually morally bankrupt. 
- So we need some form of moral values, perhaps [Humanism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humanism)? (which is also happens to be the main form of value set in Star Trek).

As far as commerce:

- No more corporate identities.
- A [resource based](http://www.thevenusproject.com/a-new-social-design/resource-based-economy) economy that can nurture nature and the environment rather than destroy it. Perhaps something along the lines of the [Venus Project](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Venus_Project#Theory)?
- No loans, no debt, no credit, no interest, no creation of currency based on interest.
- No economic growth, no need to emphasize inflation. Reward for competitive advantage is not in the form of profit.

Government and social:

- Police: Perhaps, everyone above a certain age must undergo police training, and must be a police officer 1-2 months a year? In Israel, Military service is mandatory, as a side effect everyone is trained, there isn't a power trip between civilians like there is in the US between power hungry officers and civilians. Everyone is aware of the rules, so one person cannot exploit the knowledge (or lack thereof) of another as in a police-civilian relationship.

- Education: No private education, society as a whole must aim to achieve advancement of their population, not one group over another.

- Health: Every human being deserves to live a healthy life, but at the same time, one who chooses to harm themselves via smoking or bad diet/life style should receive lower priority and wait longer on the waiting list.

- Shelter: Every human being deserves a **basic** form of shelter, and **basic** food to survive. You want more? work for it.

- Rights and laws: universal human rights and environment rights are the highest priority beyond any federal or state law or constitution.

Economics,A non-technical primer: summer 2010 and summer 1931,"You might be surprised -- depending where you are reading this -- that the Great Depression was an international downturn. Indeed it would not have achieved such severity without this global dimension. You might also be surprised that in 1931 the title ""Great Depression"" was already taken. It belonged to the 1890-95 global recession, and if you'd asked anyone in 1931, they'd tell you *that* was the Great Depression. Little did they know they'd find a way to eclipse it. A key factor in their ""success"" was a prevailing wisdom guiding policymakers.

The prevailing wisdom held that no currency was trustworthy unless it was locked to other currencies, and through those currencies to a precious metal -- gold. This way, the government is forced to keep its fiscal accounts in order. If it spends more than it taxes, the excess spending finds its way to the foreign exchange market (simply, the market where supply and demand for foreign currency meet). Normally, just about as much foreign money is arriving at the fx market seeking local money, as local money is seeking foreign money; supply and demand are balanced and the exchange rate is steady. (The central bank can fine-tune the market to ensure that supply and demand exactly balance -- thus ""pegging"" the exchange rate. It does this by buying foreign currency when too much is offered and selling it when  too little is offered.) When the government overspends, there's too much money arriving at the fx market. Unless all the other governments are spending this wildly, there's no reason to expect *their* monies to show up at the fx market in these greater amounts. Hence, your government has created an excess demand for foreign currency in the fx market.

Here's the rub: even when the government is completely virtuous (no fiscal deficits), a gap in the fx market can still materialize. The government next door might run a fiscal surplus (collecting more tax than it spends -- maybe it's worried about inflation). A smaller amount of its money will show up at the fx market, while the same amount of *your* money shows up, meaning there is an excess demand for foreign currency in the fx market. A second rub: although your central bank can fine-tune these discrepancies, it cannot indefinitely supply the excess foreign currency demanded, because its reserves are limited. The clincher: in order to keep supply and demand balanced (in the fx market), your government is going to have to cut spending and/or raise taxes to generate a surplus. Never mind that it already has a high unemployment rate and that spending cuts will throw even more people out of work. The prevailing wisdom demands it! 

Before we lower this conceptual framework onto the Depression, some admin. The government budget is a policy tool. Another tool is the central bank's interest rate. By raising the interest rate offered on deposits in the domestic money, the central bank increases the demand for domestic money. Voilà, the fx market gap is filled. So we have two policy tools. Now, when the fx market yawns, you've got to deploy these tools to keep the currency stable, or ""pegged"". It can be painful (and politically costly); imagine your government doing so in the midst of recession. In the Great Depression, several sources of fx drain hit the world economy in tight succession or in tandem. Each necessitated a counter-response: a tightening in fiscal or monetary policy or both. The essence of the Great Depression is that each tightening required another tightening, and so forth. It's worth detailing these, because they are no mere relics. *We've either seen them in today's cycle or we may soon.* I draw on Eichengreen, *Golden Fetters* (Oxford, 1992).

**Commodity collapse.** The first round of the Great Depression preceded the US stock market crash (Oct 1929). It hit commodity exporters. A late-1920s decline in their export prices hit earnings. Yet imports, which contained manufactured goods, were not cheaper. This generated gaps in their fx markets which drove them to fiscal and monetary austerity and to re-double their export quantities. This exacerbated the decline in commodity prices, and in mid-1929 the bottom fell out:

&gt; ... the precipitous drop in commodity prices after the summer of 1929 rendered even the most heroic adjustments inadequate. Resistance to policies of austerity, which were blamed for worsening the economic crisis or shifting the burden onto the working class, was mounting throughout Central Europe and Latin America. (p. 231). 

**Capital retreat.** As the US stock market bubble inflated it lured US capital back from abroad. Moreover, the Fed was raising the interest rate to fight the bubble, making US deposits more attractive. This was particularly damaging to Europe, because US citizens had been important providers of short-term bank deposits there. ""By the end of 1929, recession was almost universally evident."" (p. 246)

**Foreign bust.** If your major trade partner suffers a recession, it will affect the fx market in two major ways. The depressed state of the economy reduces the demand for your exports -- hence fewer export earnings. Second, if that economy starts deflating, then its prices are falling below yours, so that your economy is uncompetitive against it -- again reducing your exports. The USA suffered a series of sharp recessions in 1929-33, each stifling its demand for world trade and pressing down its domestic prices. Waves of austerity abroad were required to match the USA deflation and depression.

**Debt.** Recall the commodity exporters. They were also major international debtors. Although their export earnings were falling, their international debt obligations were fixed. They had to service and re-pay the same amount of debt out of declining income. The same story applied to the individual household or business.The US price level fell during the depression. This meant that businesses and households received lower income. But their debts were fixed: hence their debt burden actually grew. This drove them to insolvency. The insolvency then undermined the financial health of their lender (typically, a regional bank). Aware of the declining health of said lender, depositors took out their money, triggering bank runs. Irving Fisher in 1933 called this the ""Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions."" Note his use of the plural.

**We arrive now at 1931.** There had not been a major sovereign default. That was about to change. Souring loans among the commodity exporters killed the appetite for foreign lending, which ""transformed the Central European financial situation"" (p.261). The banking system there had grown heavily dependent upon foreign funds. As those vanished, there was no cushion when domestic depositors wanted out. In May 1931, a lot of them did: the financial status of Austria's biggest bank was revealed to be horrendous. The ensuing bank crisis brought down the Austrian currency and triggered crises in Hungary and Germany, bringing down their currencies. Britain was a major creditor to these economies and lost assets as these credits became unpayable. On September 21, Britain's own currency was brought down. 

""Brought down"" means losing the peg, or departing the open world financial and trade system (in order to keep the currency ostensibly pegged; after all, if you can control trade and financial flows, you can control the supply and demand for fx). Both were violations of the prevailing wisdom. In retrospect, loss of the peg (""devaluation"") was better. It enabled the country to remain in the world system and conduct expansionary policy (budget deficit and monetary expansion), possibly generating demand for the rest of the world too. The first countries to leave the gold standard were the first to escape the great depression. Another option, taken by Germany, was to un-plug from the world economy and conduct transactions only through tight controls. A third option, for those who could afford it, was keeping the peg and staying plugged-in. It was available to France and the USA. France kept to it until 1935-36, the USA till 1933. The USA decision to devalue in 1933 was crucial: it turned the tide of the Great Depression, whereas France endured years of depression, hampered by an uncompetitive exchange rate.

Why did France keep the peg? Because of the prevailing wisdom. Defence of currency pegs was a cardinal principle of the gold standard, and the defence of the gold standard was likened to defending civilisation itself. ""It would be difficult to devise a measure that would give a greater shock to the world's trade and credit than departure of Britain from the Gold Standard,"" pronounced a Cabinet Memo on September 3, 1931. Such fears proved unfounded, which makes their unqualified assertion an example of [dogma](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/dogma). *The dogma of the gold standard compelled policy decisions both self-injurious and injurious to the global economy.*

**2010**. The crisis in the euro-area features sovereign debt of the weaker members. Greek sovereign debt is not repayable. Yet it is owed to the banking system at the core of the EU. Hence, the EU has arranged 750 billion euros in loans to ""help"" Greece. This does not address the underlying problem. Greek prices and wages are uncompetitive. It needs both a debt adjustment and a currency. The latter is the only realistic way of bringing the economy back into line with the rest of the world. 

The EU is said to face an ""existential"" crisis if Greece defaults and/or withdraws (Angela Merkel's words). What support does this statement have? The danger is that it traps policymakers into the absurd and the capricious, in the same way that gold standard dogma motivated such folly between the wars. I have sketched the key elements of another path elsewhere.

politics,Was George W. Bush the worst president in U.S. history?,"If not then how bad does he rank, who was worse than him?

**Edit:** OK I think this thread has reached a critical mass and I am going to give an over-view of what the consensus seems to be at this time. 

Credit is due to the 'too soon to tell' crowd - I can't fault the logic there, but my personal feeling is that it's fair to do this now while the details of his presidency remain fresh in our minds. We also live in a time where speed of information is such a huge factor that it's probably a good idea to make these decisions sooner than we normally would, the biggest danger is forgetting the past. 

To those suggesting that Obama/Carter are the worst: Words fail me. Not a single one of you manage to put down any rationale for this, which is a black eye to you as a group. In general I believe that you think these presidents are too soft (or too black.) Either way you seem stuck in that silly us vs. evildoers paradigm. Quite frankly I blame you people for giving us the disaster that was Bush II.  

A lot of people insist that people like Hoover, Buchanan, Harding were the worst, and while I can sympathize, I don't think their presidencies had very much long term impact. True they were corrupt of incompetent, or both but in terms of actual impact, they mostly affected our nation only and I don't get the sense that the had a lasting impact - but that's just the sense that I get at this time. 

A ton (if not most) people feel that Bush really is the worst president ever. Which I can understand but after evaluating the arguments presented here I believe that Bush is not the worst ever, but I am certain that he presided over the most outrageous fiasco ever. Bush has to be the biggest embarrassment and did more to hurt the image of the US. So as a joke of president he's my number 1 - but there were worse in terms of policy. 

Nixon got a lot of attention but mostly we remember him for being the biggest bully of president ever.

As for the worst ever I feel that the libertarian types make the most consistent arguments. Top 4 are: 
1. Wilson
2. Lincoln
3. FDR
4. Reagan

All these men had devastating policies and legacies that affected the whole world.

But my vote is for Wilson because :

Woodrow Wilson was easily the worst president of all time. He brought us the income tax, sales tax, the federal reserve, imprisoned his political enemies, the grandfather of interventionism foreign policy, and suckered us into WWI.

His biggest fuckup of all was the concessions he made during the treaty of Versailles that force Germany to pay reparations to the allied forced in return for their membership to the league of nations. These reparations led to the hyperinflation in Germany which bred the conditions to the rise of Hitler. It's impossible to know if Hitler would of came to power or not if Germany wasn't in the financial condition it was in, but it definitely didn't help.

worldnews,"Plans A, B and C for Greece and the euro","**Plan A** is the current official approach to Greece. It provides eur 110 bn in official loans for an initial 3-year period to sustain deficits which cannot be financed in the market. (The funds are charged at 3-month euribor +300 bps, rising to 400 if extended beyond three years.) Greece uses this breathing space to shrink those deficits and put the fiscal path on track to stabilise debt at an unspecified ratio of GDP; it peaks at 150% in 2013 and falls thereafter, crossing 120% in 2020. The government will also push through considerable structural reforms: privatize some SOEs; cut the minimum wage, weaken employment protections and collective bargaining power; and dismantle the barriers to entry/exit for the private sector. Finally, part of the overall loan package finances a stability fund to recapitalize domestic banks should they suffer a wave of asset failures. The ECB also provides unspecified liquidity support. (I am getting this from the [IMF programme](http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2010/cr10110.pdf) (pdf).)

It's hard to know where to start. Why not just cite the programme itself. Verbatim:

* overall debt service will rise sharply after the program: payments to both the Fund and EU would peak at 62 percent of exports of goods and service, and about 17 percent of GDP in 2015.
* Wage and price deflation, and contraction in activity could lead to sharp reductions in tax revenues, (upsetting the deficit trajectory).
* Fierce resistance from entrenched vested interests has stalled reforms in the past and the burden of adjustment ""will test the cohesiveness of Greek society"". 
* Downwardly rigid private sector wages and prices given inflexible markets are a further risk, 
* as is the possibility of yet higher interest rates. 
* loss-making public enterprises could yet present additional pressures on the budget
* risks to banks are also acute until confidence in a strong downward path for the fiscal deficit takes firmer hold. 
* External risks include the possibility of negative spillover from other highly indebted countries in the region.

**Plan B** starts from the assumption that Plan A won't work; that [Greece will arrive at year 2013 still insolvent](http://www.open-thinking.com/2010/05/plan-c.html). The economy has contracted sharply so the external debt is even less sustainable. These adverse dynamics all the while send out destabilizing signals about the outlook for other indebted euro-members, creating a permanent euro-anxiety problem in the markets. Since markets prize certainty, Plan B gives it to them. Retained from Plan A are as much of the structural reforms as possible. To make these feasible, they take place in a growth environment. (Flexible labour markets in a contracting economy flexibly shed labour.) To make growth feasible, the drachma is re-introduced 1:1 with euro; its subsequent depreciation in the fx market ensures a positive external balance for the economy by reducing domestic costs. To ensure the latter, labour unions agree not to index wage demands to expectations of inflation, for some fixed period e.g. four years. This devaluation makes debt unpayable in euros; it is therefore decreed by force majeure to be payable in drachma. This is a unilateral default. Because the economy is generating an external surplus, it is not tapping external finance anyway. Such force majeure abrogations have been done many times; [not least in the United States by FDR and Congress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#Abrogation_and_subsequent_events). The Greek public can hang on to euros if they wish, but they must pay taxes in drachma. Moreover, public sector pay will be in drachma.

It's easy to find this revolting. But consider its virtues. It crystallizes the problem now, not later, and frees the economy to begin growing again. Markets are no longer wondering what's down the road. ""What about the capital position of Greece's external creditors?"" you might ask. These banks will need a capital injection from official sources. Convert the EU loan package into exactly this recapitalisation fund. (Perhaps use the IMF credits to provide interim financing for Greece.) ""Is this a breakup of the eurozone?"" No. It's a restructuring of the euro-zone. Each member has to assess the costs and benefits of membership at the present juncture. Greece is unlikely the only member to be best served by exit, but neither is it true that all members will exit. Moreover, this could be seen as an intermediate step toward a longer-term reunification of the EMU on much more solid fiscal foundations.

**Plan C** is really the alternative to Plan B, because Plan A is not an alternative at all. No democracy will put up with interminable austerity with little relief in sight. And it's not clear that Greece's concessionary creditors (German taxpayers) will be in the mood to continue providing exceptional financing after 2012 even though it is clear that this will be required. Germany (unwisely) has its own austerity law to comply with. OK, so what is the real alternative to Plan B? Let's call Plan A ""Fiction"" because it's no plan at all. Plan B is ""Growth"" because that is the emphasis. Plan C is ""Shelter"". You end up with Plan C if the emphasis is on avoiding default. If the overriding goal is to make the creditors whole, then there is every reason to stay on the euro (why re-pay in a depreciated currency?). So Plan C keeps the euro. But since wages can't be compressed enough to produce an internal devaluation adequate to generate an external surplus, and since that would anyway just blow out the debt/GDP ratio, and since there is no recourse to currency devaluation (vis a vis euro-zone neighbours), then the only choice is to devalue through trade and financial controls. Specifically: levy a special tax on imports and provide a special rebate to exports. Forbid all cross-border financial transactions except those cleared through a centralised external debt repayment agency.

As it happens, Plan C was pursued by many central European nations caught up in the Great Depression. They instituted exchange and trade controls to ensure that adequate foreign exchange was available for debt repayment. Naturally they kept the ex-ante pegged exchange rate, since this made the burden of repayment lighter than would a depreciated exchange rate. The point is that you had to get permission to transact. Far-fetched for a modern nation? Not really. Britain rationed foreign exchange for decades after the Second World War. In fact the very post-war international monetary system was designed explicitly with restrictions on foreign-exchange transactions, in order to help governments preserve their exchange-rate pegs. This collapsed not too long ago (late 1960s). And keep in mind that many modern-day economies ration foreign exchange for non-trade purposes; this is the definition of ""capital controls"". Know too that [inroads are already being made](http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100504-708681.html?mod=WSJ_World_MIDDLEHeadlinesEurope) in that direction in Europe.

Europe's choice is Growth or Shelter. Fiction is not a solution.

UPDATE

A point about Plan C. It isn't really compatible with the freedom of citizens in any sustainable way. Since euros are rationed for cross-border transactions, one or more parallel currencies will materialise domestically, because the squeeze on domestic liquidity will be too fierce. Of course, the increasing emission of the parallel currency will drain euros out of the system, as we know from Gresham's law. The only way to prevent this is for ever-more draconian steps to enforce the rationing of euros.",finance,2010-05-29,-0.1344789653598334

politics,"If people are inherently good, no government is necessary.  If people are inherently bad, government gives one group of bad people an advantage to exploit everyone else.  But people are neither - they try to satisfy desires that are designed to satisfy the needs of survival and reproduction.","So the question becomes, ""is it better or not to have a government, if people are trying to satisfy their own desires and those of their families, friends, and so on?""  

It has been shown that all types of law besides property law and contract law are detrimental to economic progress, which many would say is the marker of a successful civilization (see: [The Growth Effects of Federal Regulation](http://mises.org/daily/2654)).  Seeing as government often claims to alleviate poverty in one way or another, this should broadly debunk this claim - obviously, people are being hindered in some way from exercising what must be their imperative economic behavior.  

The argument that follows this, often, is that government is necessary to prevent some sort of 'tragedy of the commons' scenario.  Inevitably, some reference to ""Lord of the Flies"" will come up, or some huge environmental disaster.  It should be noticed that two of the largest environmental disasters in recent history are a direct product of government control - the Chernobyl incident was severely worsened by Soviet denials of the scenario and insufficient protocols to prevent the disaster to begin with, and has result in an incredible amount of nuclear waste being dumped all over Europe and western Russia.  The second largest that comes to mind is the oil spill that occurred during the Gulf War, in an attempt by the Iraqis to deter the invading United States army.  

Of course, there is no ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario that carries more weight than the invention of nuclear weapons.  The fear of another party of people (just like themselves) creating the same weapon, or some darker desire for control, led the United States government to create this monstrosity.  

The question necessarily becomes, ""wouldn't the private market manage to create these monstrosities?""  I think that is very unlikely.  Government acquires its funds to undertake these sort of projects by coercion alone; the population really possesses no say in whether or not their money will be used towards one specific end, as absolutely countless historical events have proven, while in a private market, they may choose to cease payment to a company at any moment, or simply never give them any money to begin with, if they don't believe they're going to do something good with it.  

All goods on the private market are negotiated.  Unreasonable prices are refused outright, by either party in any transaction, while the prices in any transaction with government are decided by one party alone, unless the oppression becomes so extreme that a revolution occurs.

These facts in combination with the consideration that governmental employees have higher wages on average, and tend to produce less than their private counterparts (since less incentive is present to produce a quality product or service, as payment is guaranteed), seem to condemn absolutely every function of government except property and contract law, which themselves may be better implemented as a system of informational review prior to transactions (that is, research on somebody you're about to buy from - you do it on eBay, don't you?).

politics,Mr. Grayson sent me this about the Iraqi/Afghan wars. Opinions?,"I, for some reason, have been getting emails like this from his campaign. I support the act, but obviously I don't have (just after reading this) any more information than what he provided me with. Here's the main message:
&gt;On May 30, 2010, at 10:06 a.m, the direct cost of occupying Iraq and Afghanistan will hit $1 trillion. And in a few weeks, the House of Representatives will be asked to vote for $33 billion of additional ""emergency"" supplemental spending to continue the occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan. There will be the pretense of debate - speeches on the floor of both chambers, stern requests for timetables or metrics or benchmarks - but this war money will get tossed in the wood chipper without difficulty, requested by a President who ran on an anti-war platform. Passing this legislation will mark the breaking of another promise to America, the promise that all war spending would be done through the regular budget process. Not through an off-budget swipe of our Chinese credit card.

&gt;The war money could be used for schools, bridges, or paying everyone's mortgage payments for a whole year. It could be used to end federal income taxes on every American's first $35,000 of income, as my bill, the War Is Making You Poor Act, does. It could be used to close the yawning deficit, supply health care to the unemployed, or for any other human and humane purpose.

&gt;Instead, it will be used for war. Because, as Orwell predicted in 1984, we've reached the point where everyone thinks that we've always been at war with Eastasia. Why?

&gt;Not because Al Qaeda was sheltered in Iraq. It wasn't. And not because Al Qaeda is in Afghanistan. It isn't. Bush could never explain why we went to war in Iraq, and Obama can't explain why we are 'escalating' in Afghanistan.

&gt;So, why? Why spend $1 trillion on a long, bloody nine-year campaign with no justifiable purpose?

&gt;Remember 9/11, the day that changed everything? That was almost a decade ago. Bush's response was to mire us in two bloody wars, wars in which we are still stuck today. Why?

&gt;I can't answer that question. But I do have an alternative vision of how the last 10 years could have played out.

&gt;Imagine if we had decided after 9/11 to wean ourselves off oil and other carbon-based fuels. We'd be almost ten years into that project by now.

&gt;Imagine if George W. Bush had somehow been able to summon the moral strength of Mahatma Gandhi, Helen Keller, or Martin Luther King Jr, and committed the American people to the pursuit of a common goal of a transformed society, a society which meets our own human needs rather than declaring ""war"" on an emotion, or, as John Quincy Adams put it, going ""abroad, in search of monsters to destroy"".

&gt;Imagine.

&gt;Imagine that we chose not to enslave ourselves to a massive military state whose stated goal is ""stability"" in countries that never have been ""stable"", and never will be.

&gt;Imagine.

&gt;""Imagine all the people, living life in peace.""

**MAIN BODY**

**ARTICLE I*** Legislative

A1 S4) The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year,
and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December,
unless they shall by law appoint a different Day.

*Once a year as an expected minimum - we were clearly not intended to have such volumes of legislation passsed*

A1 S7)  All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the
House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with
Amendments as on other Bills.

*This is clearly in the discretion of the executive branch now.*

A1 S8) Section 8.  The Congress shall have Power to lay and collect Taxes, Duties,
Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence
and general Welfare of the United States; *but all Duties, Imposts and Excises
shall be uniform throughout the United States;

To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States,
and with the Indian Tribes;

*Biggest violation in whole document.  Read up on Lopez v. US, Wickard v. Fillburn, and Raich v. Ashcroft.*

To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and *uniform* Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;  To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use *shall be for a longer term than two Years;*

To make all Laws which shall be *necessary and proper* for carrying
into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested
by this Constitution in the Government of the United States,
or in any Department or Officer thereof.

*Way too broad to include - all it takes here is a single distortion of a program as ""necessary"" or ""proper,"" i.e. problem spot for discretion of judges*

A1 S9)  The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless
when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.

*Again too vague - all of the recent events with forced FEMA evacuations, prison camps, the creation of an entity immune to U.S. law, countless times in the past with protests, and so on*

No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.

*I refer to this: http://www.cato.org/pubs/journal/cj15n2-3-4.html *

No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion
to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken.

*'Progressive' taxes appear to be in direct violation of this*

No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.

*This unfortunately gets worked around by the Commerce Clause.  Most federal taxes on products amount to this.*

No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue
to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to,
or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.

*A direct result of any barriers to trade in between states - increasing propensity to monopolize by constricting market, which will enlarge existing disparities between states.*

No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence
of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account
of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be
published from time to time.

*What percent of military expenditures are not even disclosed? 25%?*

No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States;
and no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall,
without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.

*Well, we have a lot of Titles of Nobility.  'Czar' is the first one to come to mind.  'President' is next*

A1 S10)  No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or
Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money;
emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.

*If ""State"" applies to the United States as a whole, does that mean our fiat currency is invalid?  Doesn't every regulation on business impair the obligation of contracts?*

No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties
on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing
it's inspection Laws: and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts,
laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury
of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision
and Controul of the Congress.

*Basically all of our duties are more than they need to be.  You can quote me on that.*

No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of
Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any
Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or
engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger
as will not admit of delay.

*""lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace"" - this obviously gets violated, although the argument could be made that we are perpetually at war...  "" or engage in War, unless actually invaded,"" - Jesus, I can't imagine how many times we've broken that

**ARTICLE II** Executive

*This part is essentially an enumeration of executive powers - unfortunately it's hard to describe things in excess of these enumerated powers this way.*

A2 S1) No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States,
at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to
the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that
Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years,
and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.

*Ahem*

The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services,
a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during
the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive
within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.

Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the
following Oath or Affirmation:--""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that
I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States,
and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States.""

A1S2)  The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army
and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States,
when called into the actual Service of the United States;
he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer
in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to
the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power
to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States,
except in Cases of impeachment.

A2 S3)  He shall from time to time give to the Congress
Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient;
he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either
of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to
the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall
think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers;
he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall
Commission all the Officers of the United States.

A2 S4) The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the
United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for,
and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.

**ARTICLE III** Judicial

A3 S2)  The Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury;
and such Trial shall be held in the State where the said Crimes shall
have been committed; but when not committed within any State, the Trial
shall be at such Place or Places as the Congress may by Law have directed.

A3 S3)  Treason against the United States, shall consist only in
levying War against them, or in adhering to their Enemies, giving them
Aid and Comfort.  No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on
the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act, or on Confession
in open Court.

**ARTICLE IV**

A4 S2) The Citizens of each State shall be entitled to all
Privileges and Immunities of Citizens in the several States.

**ARTICLE VI**

This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made
in Pursuance thereof; and all Treaties made, or which shall be made,
under the Authority of the United States, shall be the supreme
Law of the Land; and the Judges in every State shall be bound thereby,
any Thing in the Constitution or Laws of any State to the Contrary
notwithstanding.

*This one is bizarre.  I can think of so, so many instances where it's been violated.*

The Senators and Representatives before mentioned, and the Members of the
several State Legislatures, and all executive and judicial Officers,
both of the United States and of the several States, shall be bound
by Oath or Affirmation, to support this Constitution; but no religious
Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust
under the United States

If they taxed them again like that all would be fine as it was in the 50's and 60's. Spending does NOT need to be cut.","The major western countries aren't ""broke"". They simply stopped taxing their richest citizens like they did in the 50's and 60's. If they taxed them again like that all would be fine as it was in the 50's and 60's. Spending does NOT need to be cut.

The problem is that politically active groups have been trying to starve governments of funds as a means of cutting popular social programs and retaining wealth among the super rich. (It was a strategy called ""Starve the beast"" in the 1980's by Grover Norquist) 
they succeeded in cutting estate and dividend and capital gains and top income taxes and as a result the super rich pay a far less share of the taxes than the percentage of the societies wealth they own. 

(it  doesn't matter if they pay a high percentage of the total taxes - it only matters if they pay taxes that are proportionate to the percentage of the wealth they own. for example if 1 man owns 90% of the gold and pays 55% percent of the taxes he can say he pays more than anyone else. However it is not relevant because it simply hides the fact that he doesn't pay in proportion to the benefit he gets from the societies laws that protect his wealth and status. if he owns 90% of the gold he should be paying 90% of the taxes not 55%. ((By the way in fact today 1% of the population owns 90% of the stock for example) )

The answer to the government ""sovereign debt"" issues is simply tax the rich in the percentages that worked so well in the 50's and 60's and society will boom just like it did then and without the fake debt and tax evasion chicanory that caused the fake economic growth spurts since then. Grover Norquist is hoping you will now instead cut the leg off the beast he has starved. Instead you should give the beast more food from the super rich.

You can either cut spending or raise revenue to balance a governments budget.

If you cut spending so much that you hurt your middle class then you will shrink the economy.
We have reached that point.

Spending befitting the middle class needs to INCREASE and taxes need to get back to what they were for the wealthy in the 50's and 60's when America built the strongest economy with the strongest middle class the world had ever seen.

interesting info from here
http://www.uic.edu/depts/lib/documents/resources/tax99/taxhistory.shtml#america
""In 1798, Congress levied the first direct tax on American property, including lands, houses and slaves.  (This was a wealth tax. They figured out the value of your home, slaves and land and taxed you in proportion to the wealth you owned- insert me) Temporary income taxes were also imposed on citizens by both sides of the Civil War in order to raise wartime funds, and in 1862 the Office of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue was created to collect wartime income tax funds. The first peacetime income tax was imposed in 1894, a 2-percent tax on earnings above $4000, which at that time only affected the very richest 2-percent of Americans. (income taxes were always supposed to only be paid by the top richest people in the country - the standard deduction was supposed to cover the amount needed by a normal person live so they would only pay taxes on excess income - insert me) Income taxes became a permanent feature of American life in 1913, with ratification of the 16th Amendment. Taxes were expanded during World War I with revenue acts which created federal estate taxes as well as greater taxes on earnings by individuals and businesses. ""


A final thought: society (and the government that they elect) doesn't have to choose between bacon and gravy.
We can spend on bacon and gravy and even a little caviar if we only tax the super wealthy in proportion to the wealth of society that they own. All of humanities wealth has advanced over the past 50 years from things like computerization which allows this fact. We just have to go after the horders. Remember they wouldn't own the wealth if our society didn't enforce the ownership rules they allow them to own it. They benefit more form the rules than anyone so they should pay fairly for it.

Furthermore remember that having a larger more educated middle class (from lower relative middle class taxation - better and free education and healthcare and higher minimum wages so more income is earned for less time) increases the wealth of society for EVERYONE (including the Superrich) because society advances and more of the society is able to make large contributions to the society increasing its advancement and ultimately its wealth. You want the most healthy brains as educated as possible with the free time to make huge advances for society as you can get and not forced to do mundane survival things. 10 million PHD's under government grants or on the ""dole"" does more to advance society if just ONE of them makes a ground breaking discovery than 10 million impoverished un educated people who can't think because they can't even feed themselves from their minimum wages much less spend time doing things that might make a breakthrough.


It's better for the super rich to be superich in a nation of a large middle class than it is for them to be the super-rich of a nation with a non existent middle class. the first is even richer in both value of assets and societies research and advancements than the second superrich guy. The first has a better chance for a long happy life (because research and advances such as in health, transportation, lifestyle innovation etc will be so much more in the first society ) than the second superrich guy.",finance,2010-06-02,-0.0197265721296084

Economics,EMU and the Trilemma. Get ready for capital controls?,"The [trilemma](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity) holds that economic policy must sacrifice one of the following three items: open capital flows, fixed exchange rate, monetary policy independence. For reasons that I won’t explain here, policymakers must forswear macroeconomic demand management completely (not just monetary policy) if they choose peg+open capital flows. And if they choose peg+independent macro management, then they will ultimately need to close not only the capital account (investment flows) but the trade account as well, because capital controls will be evaded via the trade account (e.g. through misstated invoicing).

If EMU-integrity is seen as a ‘Maginot line’ for the European project, then we have to be honest about the consequences. Will the citizens of a democracy put up with interminable austerity and rising unemployment? If not, and if EMU-integrity is sacrosanct, then the trilemma suggests that capital controls are the only option, because they can be combined with a fixed currency and internal demand-management policy (reflation). ('Fixed-currency' is relevant here despite having a unified currency, because a reflationary policy will require the emission of a parallel legal tender.)

Capital controls would by necessity have draconian ends, for the reasons already stated. But if EMU is seen as inviolable, it might be the unforeseen consequence. Sadly, Europe has been here before — in some respects, precisely here. But that’s another story.",finance,2010-06-05,-0.0542243624394997

[i.e. Jobs whose output cannot be used directly by the employee in any small number of steps]  Those jobs are the ones that keep a large and populous economy working.

Before industrial-revolution city jobs, everyone had inherited, ownership-based and apprenticeship-derived work.  Complex jobs were few and could be easily limited/controlled by guilds.  Everything else was doable with a few nearly-unspecialized skills everyone had.

As the huge revolution's thirst for workers is slacking, the only areas apparently expanding in labor are low-low-wages for some and moderate-to-high technocrat wages spread over the earth.  Some are jobs that are highly simplified to support mechanized or derived forms of work (farms, cleaning, transportation, construction).  On the other side are a dwindling number (only one designer needed per million copies) of high-education jobs that are continuously being spread to all countries that can teach.  

[ Luxury/service work makes up the rest but those jobs only exist when lower wage people help a reasonably large number of higher wage people.  If the number in luxury dwindles.. they mostly disappear. ]

Given ""Baumol's Cost Disease"" driving up non-automated costs and the endless emphasis on supply-side economics, what is left of first world demand if their workers are, in majority of numbers, useless?

So, in essence, is most of the 'industrial/informatoin revolution' productivity going to go unused until it becomes nearly free or fed with free energy?   Will wages exist somewhere to benefit from the factory's outputs?

If the fed would just feed the rabbits or the plants the wolves would survive on their own, but as it is the whole ecosystem is about to collapse due to over-predation and the Fed is running out of reserve food.


When that happens the abundant wolf population will attempt to eat every last rabbit and things will be very very bad for the rabbits for a while. Then when there aren't enough rabbits the wolf population will collapse worse than it would have if they had not been fed by the fed.

NOTE: I am not anti-food stamps. It is a vital social program. I received food stamps once, but immediately began supplementing my diet with my own container grown food, because I had no yard. Also if people cannot grow where they live, there are community gardens, that also serve as learning to grow food centers for beginning gardeners. I would rather see federal and state money going to schools and other social programs. People becoming a bit more self sufficient in the food department, rather than waiting for a hand out with food stamps or the food bank would be a positive during this economic turmoil.",finance,2010-06-07,0.0067067927862689

EDIT: @20 hours after original posting

Holy shit there were a lot of responses...I was expecting, at most, about 50...not 1145.  I'm not going to be able to respond to anyone directly, but I think it's important that I clarify what I was saying and address a few common points mentioned below.  

 - **For socialism and capitalism, I'm using their economic definitions here (state ownership/private ownership).  Since we're basically a democracy and anything owned by the state is owned by us, I'm basically saying ""we own everything""/""rich people own everything""...and that's a very important distinction which seems to be lost in the noise.  I'm referring to the economic systems...I don't care whether some nation who called itself 'socialist' was all about the suppression of free speech, that would be related to their socio-political system, not their economic system**

 - **'Necessities' were left undefined intentionally.  The idea was that we could agree on the basics (socialism for necessities; capitalism for everything else) and hammer out the details of it all later.  It's not my place to say what is and is not necessary.**

 - There are many different ways to fund both and different ways that they could operate.  The state could take taxpayer funds and found a for-profit company; the socialized operation could require constant injections of new capital, or it could be mandated to earn a 'profit' (which would be passed on to the taxpayers as a sort of dividend)...it doesn't matter though, at least not for what I was trying to point out.

 - Just because something is considered a necessity and is socialized, doesn't mean private companies are barred from that industry.  The socialized aspect should be the absolute bare minimum.  For example, food is a necessity.  The state could produce 'nutrition bars' (basically protein bars) which taste like cardboard, but will keep you alive and basically healthy, while providing clean drinking water.  Sure, some people may be perfectly happy to only ever have water and the nasty protein bars...but for most, it would be a strong incentive to advance beyond the bare minimum (while removing the inherent coercion associated with fearing poverty-related starvation).   Basically, the backbone of the 'necessities' would be socialism.

 - This is my personal idea of what would be a necessity (not that it's actually relevant):  You have two types of necessities, those that keep you alive/prevent death (food, shelter, emergent healthcare, police, etc.) and those which allow one the opportunity to move beyond poverty (education/training, public transportation, preventative healthcare, ...possibly internet access to some extent, etc.).  The move-beyond necessities are where a lot of people might get cranky, but they're beneficial to society in the long run.  If you have a large population of uneducated people with really low standards of living who are suffering and stuck in their situation, etc.  they'll be more likely to commit violence (rob, burglary, murder, etc.) which is just bad for everyone.  More so, by providing move-beyond necessities, we're giving the poor an opportunity for class-stratification based on merit/traits we value as a society (as opposed to criminal behavior, etc.).


 - A lot of you are just fucking retarded.  You interpret a simple statement as ""IMMA COME TO YO HOUSE AND ROB YO TO PAY FOR MY MERCEDES CUZ I NEEDS DAT""...if that statement is similar to a comment you made on here, you're an idiot.  .

 - When it comes to income taxation, it's not theft.  You choose to utilize and benefit from the many systems we have in place to procure pieces of paper we (well, the fed) printed out and claimed to have value.  In exchange for giving you the resources and security necessary to earn that money, you pay income taxes.  If you don't want to pay said income taxes, you don't need to participate in said exchange.  By taking the money and utilizing its supporting and related infrastructures, you're agreeing to the terms by which that money was originally created and disbursed...if you don't like it, you don't have to earn money (in an ideal world, you could just stay on your property and grow your own food...but there is the whole property tax issue and I would agree that this needs to be drastically altered...but that's another issue entirely).  Theoretically, a person should be able to live entirely on their own...if they so chose.  But if you want the nice things that society produces, you need to pay your taxes.

 - Our system of capitalism is not set up to benefit the creators and inventors...it's set up to protect capital (i.e. investors or 'Owners'...those with the capital).  Look to pharmaceutical companies...a human being can invent a new life-saving medication, but what they did was considered a 'work for hire' and so the IP goes to the corporation, not the inventor.  Said inventor could, if it suited the company, be let go immediately after making the discovery and in no way benefit from the millions of dollars brought in by their medication.

 - Also, yes, we do incorporate socialism in the US...but in a lot of ways I think we do it wrong.  We're so concerned that people will 'freeload' that we make eligibility horribly restricted.  Look to medicaid as an example of this.  Any uninsured citizen can't just go on medicaid...hell, even uninsured citizens well below the poverty line aren't necessarily eligible; one has to meet certain criteria (i.e. old, pregnant, disabled, etc.).We prioritize 'puinishing freeloaders' over 'helping the needy'...and now there are an assload of americans without access to basic medical care, not because they're 'freeloaders', but because they don't fit some rich white persons schema of 'deserving of help'.  ...it's fucking insane.",cryptocurrency,2010-06-08,-0.0679929183622025

Stewart, like several presidents (most recently G.W.B. and his 'opponent' John Kerry) was a member of ..wait for it...""Skull and Bones.""","Stewart also concurred with the *previous* opinion in Furman v. Georgia, which led to a de facto abolishment of the death penalty through a doctrine of consistent application.  Stewart was nominated to the Supreme Court by Eisenhower, ""Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces"" in Europe during WWII, and later President.

Eisenhower's campaign was founded on a battle against ""communism, Korea, and corruption.""  Incidentally, Eisenhower significantly increased the Social Security program and initiated the Interstate Highway System, both an asset to transportation, an environmental disaster, and in the future, a legal tool to make states accept federal laws by way of categorical grants.  Eisenhower is notably linked to the ""Bohemian Club,"" and was a member of the ""Council on Foreign Relations,"" along with, really, every president in recent history dating as far back as Rutherford Hayes.  It should be noted that G.W.B's grandfather, Prescott Bush, was a golfing buddy of Eisenhower, and took credit for getting Nixon into office.

In other words, Eisenhower's presidency was another step towards ""communism,"" or total state control of the economy, and an open invitation for corruption (though paling in comparison to F.D.R.'s presidency).


I'm not even going to touch the topic of Eisenhower's riding to the presidency based on lies about Nazi Germany.  I will let this site sum up my feelings on this: http://www.revisionists.com/revisionism.html .

gaming,Why Nintendo won E3 (secondary counter-argument for those against Nintendo's E3 presentation),"Nintendo swept up E3 this year. Some people seem to think otherwise. I'm here to drop a few points of my own that I haven't seen posted yet.  
  
First, let's examine the competition. Microsoft brought Kinect to the table alongside various other FPS games. Sony also opened with their motion-sensing peripheral Move, followed by two FPS games, two racing games, and a platformer.  
  
Judging by the amount of variety already displayed, Microsoft should be eliminated from the competition, but I'll keep them around for comparisons. Nintendo brought in two adventure games, two platformers and one semi-platformer, an FPS, an RPG, and a bunch of Sports games. After all the games they showed, they concluded with a lengthy preview of the 3DS with a rails shooter.  
  
Zelda: Skyward Sword brings nothing unique to the table of adventure games except for one big advantage: Wii Motion Plus. Developers have always been seeking to simplify controls and make them more realistic and functional for gamers and now, we're finally on the receiving end of a full-length adventure game, where the position of the controller you are holding actually determines the position of the sword you are carrying. This is not something small - this is a big step forward in terms of gaming and it cannot be passed off merely as a gimmick because it's absolutely required to progress through the game as the game is based around combat involving the sword.  
  
Epic Mickey, according to the developers, allows the player to interact and shape the plot in more than one way imaginable. This isn't the first time a game like this has used this idea, but I believe it is the first time a game of this generation has used that idea to this caliber. I can't judge too far into it because I haven't played the final version of it yet.  
  
Donkey Kong Country Returns has a lot of nostalgia behind it but the game does not look to be a complete remake. Judging by what we've seen, almost everything about it has been tampered with, yet it still retains the amount of rushing and style we've seen in previous games.  
  
Kirby's Epic Yarn follows the same formula that I gave above. The game looks like it's been redone from the ground up.  
  
Metroid: Other M is in it's own league. So far, I've seen platforming, shooting from the first person, and third person gameplay involved in it. That's also why I mentioned it being a semi-platformer, because it looks like Team Ninja(?) is attempting to combine elements from all sorts of other genres into it.  
  
I'm not going to comment on NBA Jam 07 or Goldeneye, because I'm sure that they were just thrown into the blender for nostalgia sake. However, I will comment on the Mario Sports mashup game that we've seen. Of course, the game itself isn't anything heavily unique but I've always found the Mario sports games to be fun - even if that compromised the maturity factor. Judging from what we saw, it looks like they're porting some of the earlier Mario sports titles to the Wii while also bringing in some new ones, so I can't see the problem with this. Not only that, but I'd rather see it this way - as one title - rather than having each individual game being released over some sort of DLC shop.  
  
Kid Icarus doesn't look anything special, but I again can't really judge because I haven't picked up the 3DS which is where it's apparently supposed to shine. I can't really speak up for Golden Sun either because we've only seen so much media for it.  
  
The 3DS represented a huge technological footstep for electronics everywhere and I really don't feel like going too much into this because it's fairly obvious what I'm getting at.  
  
Now, let's compare that to the 360's lineup of FPS ""sequels"" or Eyetoy 2.0 while standing.   
  
Sony did have some good games lined up, such as Little Big Planet 2: although the platforming aspect of that game is really nothing out of the ordinary, the impeccable style and the customization factor of the game definitely is worth the mention. To be quite honest, I've never been a fan of the Twisted Metal series nor have I seen much media for it, however we do need more over-the-top racing games for today, and what better place than on the console with the highest graphical capabilities. The other FPS titles Sony mentioned are nothing impressive - Killzone 3 just has buffed graphics and an ability to jump higher (see: jetpack) while Dead Space 2 is Dead Space, or any other horror shooter really... minus the horror aspects. (Sorry, just didn't find Dead Space anything great)  
  
And that is why Nintendo won E3

politics,Louisiana's best possible next move?,"Let's face it: Louisiana is being ignored by the rest of the country. The state doesn't receive even HALF of the oil revenue from the drilling off it's shores (a price the state has paid since Huey P. Long was in charge about 80 years ago,) while Texas receives (correct me if I'm wrong) approximately 80% of it's offshore drilling revenue. The oil crisis is ONLY receiving attention because it could possibly swing around to the Eastern Seaboard and because there are at least a few people who give a damn. 

I honestly think the best option is for the state to cut off the oil from the rest of the country in response to the lack of real, substantive aid it's gotten and because of the moratorium that has been placed on drilling (6 months of no jobs for those workers, for the record). Louisiana is getting little to none of the aid it needs due to its being part of a country of 50 states, none of which are willing to budge and give some money. The cut off of oil would force the government to finally sit down and maybe even reach some sort of middle ground with the state rather than giving lofty speeches (that barely relate to the issue) and, as cliche as this may sound, empty promises 

The federal governments ""assistance"" is ostensible at best, BP's complete and utter failure needs no explanation, and frankly it's getting ridiculous. Katrina (for those who say ""get over it"" about Katrina, trust me it's far from fixed here) wrecked the south of LA and the gulf coast, oil is now flooding what little protection the state has from hurricanes, and the country just watches with glazed eyes unwilling to save its own people.

worldnews,NATO Membership for the Republic of Georgia: US should stay the course.,"Providing a Membership Action Plan to the Republic of Georgia would not serve the alliance’s best interests because of current Georgian instability, Russian protest, and Western European apprehension. Two strategic options remain available to the United States and NATO.  NATO can drop Georgia and quit any aid to the country or extend the process of membership candidacy indefinitely. 
Georgia has some strategic interest to NATO. However, this strategic interest is not worth a potential war with Russia.  Robert E. Hunter, former US ambassador to NATO said in his interview with the RAND Corporation that, “Georgia is an out-of-the-way part of the world, which no one in the alliance, we discovered last summer, is prepared to defend.” (Gwartzman 1). Georgia’s strategic worth is not worth the collective security of the alliance. Dropping Georgia’s candidacy would certainly help with NATO- Russian relations and an agreeable Russian Federation is better than a disappointed Georgia. However, American and NATO legitimacy is necessary for hegemony. Other countries may feel the cold shoulder to the region and radically change their alignment due to Western abandonment. Countries such as Ukraine or Croatia may choose to create closer ties to Russia if the United States allows NATO to completely drop Georgia. 
The second option is to follow the current strategic position of NATO and extend the process of candidacy indefinitely. According to Zbigniew Brzezinski, “In steering a prudentially balanced course, NATO should maintain its formal position that eventual membership in NATO is open to (Georgia and Ukraine) but at the same time continue to expand its collaborative relationship with Russia itself” (Brzezinski 11). This is to say that the current course is ideal. It allows NATO to approach Russia and does not apply further pressure on the already tenuous article 5 agreement. The current policy doesn’t call for abandoning current commitments to the Georgian government. Therefore, aid given by the United States should continue. This will continue the development process in Georgia and the funds utilized are affordable at the current rate.   Also the promise of membership will remain an enticement for better a democracy and more transparency. 
Maintaining ties to Georgia also allows the alliance to place a diplomatic check on Russia. The Federation should not gain any leverage from the 2008 invasion. Hunter said in his interview, “Russia’s behavior was unacceptable and Russia needs to move from the nineteenth-century Russian way of doing business, to the twenty-first century way of doing business with the rest of the world. So the first thing NATO has to do is to continue its reassurance to Georgia that it is not alone” (Gwartzeman 2).  It is important for NATO to make a statement against Russia’s invasion. Dropping Georgia’s candidacy completely would embolden Russia to do something similar in the future. Russia must understand that aggressive acts endanger fundamental agreements made since the end of the Cold War. 
The maintenance of the current policy is in the best interest of NATO and the United States. Elongating the process of Georgian membership without denying it maintains diplomatic ties with both belligerents in the 2008 war and does not further complicate NATO’s strategic aims or challenges. This policy will not spread the alliance any thinner and NATO will continue to stay unified while Georgia still reaps the benefits of foreign assistance regardless of its formal NATO status.",finance,2010-06-23,0.0852916087927681

Economics,Sobering thoughts about the price level,"Money's key function is means of exchange (beats bartering). Most money is created by the financial system. When it creates a loan, 'new' money is created. (A new entry is created in the asset ledger of the financial institution, which is the loan that you need to repay. A similar entry is created on the liability side. This is the money, drawn against the financial institution, that you are enabled to spend. Because of fractional-reserve banking, this is 'new' money, it doesn't come from the financial institution's existing money holdings e.g. deposits.) OK. Now run that process in reverse. In other words, the balance sheet of the financial institution shrinks, i.e. there is net loan repayment, whether because people are trying to reduce their debts or because the financial institution itself needs for prudential or regulatory reasons to increase its capital/asset ratio. Money is destroyed. 

All else being equal, this would be deflationary. Why hasn't it been? Many people are tempted to look at the foundational component of money in the economy, which is 'base money', 'central bank money', 'high-powered money', m0, they're all synonyms. This is the money created by the Fed. And **yes** the Fed has created legions of this money in the wake of the aforementioned financial institution balance sheet shrinkage a.k.a. de-leveraging. But this has not been effective (at least so far -- that expansion of m0 is a huge source of worry for some). There is no appetite to 'pyramid' new money (loans) on top of this base money, resulting in this money just accumulating in the banks' own balances. To see this, it is imperative to look at measures of money supply which include such bank-created money. 

So why no deflation? The reason is that government EDIT: *over*spending has created new money. The financial system writes it the loans and thus the new spending power, which is injected into the economy. *Fiscal deficits have propped up the price level.* Which brings me to the ""sobering thoughts"". If this process is now likely to go into reverse or at least to abate, it is hard to believe that the price level will not fall. (This is an ideologically gleeful outcome for some redditors, but do not be fooled. Deflation in the presence of nominally contracted debt is a nightmare scenario. And no person of the pro-deflation school has yet bothered to explain away that particular dilemma.)

Quick addendum: This is not a post about 'fractional reserve banking'. And it is not meant to be particularly normative in any respect. Just a chance to discuss the outlook for the price level.",finance,2010-06-23,-0.0463158547348899

politics,Hey Reddit. When I go to vote in the next general election I am voting out every single person currently in office. What about you?,"Yeah. So party goes right out the window for me next election. This has been the most useless and disgustingly partisan Federal, State, and local government I have seen in my 35 years. I am making a list of those on the ballot that are running for reelection, and then voting them out, regardless of the oppositions party and agenda because I have come to learn that agenda for the most part is just partisan bullshit to get you elected. We as a nation could do little worse than we are already doing with our current leadership. Economy in the toilet. Infrastructure is falling apart. The war is a complete clusterfuck. 10% of the nation is out of work. States cant pass a damn budget. Deficit is skyrocketing. The earth is fucking bleeding. etc..etc...

What do you think reddit? Are you going to vote along party lines or are you like me and are ready to send a message to our leaders that WE put them in office and this is OUR country and we are taking it back.

Disclaimer: I am a moderate, registered [MWP](http://www.modernwhig.org/), that voted Obama last general election. The rest of my votes were spread across both primary and a couple secondary parties. I greatly dislike fundamentalism from both ends of the spectrum. 

Edit: Wow, I expected this debate to turn really ugly, but the debate so far has remained pretty on track and civil. Good job Reddit! There is hope for us yet.",finance,2010-06-24,-0.4273095109915097

business,"Help, Bizreddit! Can you recommend any software/widget to help manage a large daycare center's students &amp; wait list?","The daycare center I'm probably going to start work in in a couple of weeks has a huge problem.

We have between 100-180 children enrolled depending on season (summers = more kids), and about 400 (!!) children waitlisted.

We already have software to manage payroll, food and supplies ordering etc. But we desperately need an automated way to do the following:

   1.

      When a child reaches a certain age, s/he needs to be moved up to a new classroom as per federal &amp; state guidelines (e.g. we can only wait a maximum of one month after a child's 1st birthday to move him/her from the infant room to the 1-2yr room).
   2.

      Each room has a maximum capacity, and we need to be warned a month or two in advance if any room is heading towards over-capacity (e.g. all ten slots of the 1-2yr room are filled, but three infants are going to turn one next month).
   3.

      And lastly we need a way to manage our giant wait list. As it stands, our Excel files simply register kids into the waitlist as they come in, and the kids' ages are never updated, leading to massive confusion when we call up a supposedly 6-month-old on our waitlist when a space opens up in the infant room, only to find out that the child is now 3 years old!

So we need software or a widget or something that helps us manage this. BONUS points if it's free or open source, but I think the center may be willing to pay up to a few hundred dollars flat fee for something like this.

The thing is, they won't buy any software package that does payroll and scheduling and billing etc in addition to this. They don't want to mess with what they already have in place. We just need something very specific and small.

Can anybody point me in the right direction? Thanks!",finance,2010-06-24,-0.1631122188154153

politics,"The truth about the ""Free"" Market","The same way a marriage will only last if transparency exists for both spouse, our capitalist system will only last if true transparency exists for all parties. It only works if citizens have the ability to know what it is they are buying and what is in those products and the condition of the labor that creates them. When consumers are allowed to know what it is that goes into products only then can they make informed decisions on whether they truly want to make that purchase.

 The problem, however, is that the same politicians who say they are fighting for our interests as individuals are really fighting for the rights of these companies to hide what is in their products and the condition of how they are made.

I think it is laughable when both republicans and democrats use the pretext of individual rights and the free market to argue against labeling products/disclosing information about their business. These are rights those ""evil socialist"" nations of Europe have gotten for their citizens years ago.

Not being able to know what's in your burger (i.e what you are buying) is not compatible with true free-market capitalism but rather this symptom of crony capitalism and is anything but ""free"". What it really is is corporate favoritism, it is a pay-to-play system that has engulfed our nation, made a few people extremely wealthy and hung the poor out to dry.  The country's makeup as it is now is the consequence of allowing corporations to get too powerful and too friendly to elected officials, officials who reap the benefit of these companies through campaign contributions and kickbacks. Our government is slowly being bought by corporate America.  It has gotten so bad that now it seems parts of our government have actually been completely co-opted by corporate America. Look at the members of the EPA it looks like the board of directors for Monsanto for christ's sakes.

Now with campaign finance law repeal in 2010 we can pretty much assume without a shred of uncertainty that this trend of corporate bought law-makers will only worsen. Who knows maybe someday we will be known as the United States of Halliburton! In all seriousness though, the most important thing we can do now to fix this country is to fight for regulatory oversight and campaign finance reform. This is not anti-free-market it is pro-democracy, it is pro-individual-rights and it is the true pro-American thing to do!

From looking back at Enron to Goldman Sachs to BP it is now clear that we can't just sit back and continue to let these companies underhandedly defraud our nation. We can no longer rely on some magical unproven Darwinian property of the ""free-market"" that says everything will work out in the end if we leave them alone.  Now we must demand real regulatory oversight to ensure that what they are selling truly does pass muster, and we the consumer, the American public, are truly getting what we pay for.",finance,2010-07-01,-0.0088809202780873

http://hayekcenter.org/?p=3045


Here's another interesting tidbit. 

http://mises.org/journals/qjae/pdf/qjae6_4_3.pdf
&gt;In other lectures that same year, Hayek makes more interesting comments about his new attitude towards deflation (Hayek 1979). There he explicitly confesses that he has changed his opinion about it. A threatening deflation must be stopped because due to the disappointment of expectations, it tends to induce a “secondary deflation,” that “performs no steering function” (p. 15). Hayek states that were he responsible for
monetary policy, he would prevent deflation by announcing that he would fight deflation
with all means. This very announcement, he believes, would help to stave off a
deflation. And he again shows his new inflationary bias by pointing out that “monetary
policy must prevent wide fluctuations in the quantity of money or in the income
stream”

Jut thought it was interesting after  reading the the comments on that deflation article. It's a weird disconnected from modern Austrians and what Hayek thought.",finance,2010-07-07,-0.1277352319418959

politics,A message from Ron Paul may be of interest to the Americans on Reddit.,"Dear Friend of Liberty,

The best way to know you are succeeding in changing Washington is when you get attacked by the FEC.

And attack us they have!

I'm writing you this letter today not to scare you or to cry wolf.  I'm writing to let you know that our success has its price, and that price right now is the wrath of the Obama Administration and its attack dogs at the Federal Election Commission.

I urge you to read this message and then sign the Declaration of Support (in which I ask for your advice on a critical legal and moral question), as we are forced into battle with federal agencies and courts.

You see, this isn't theoretical.  They've already come after us in multiple cases, alleging that Campaign for Liberty has acted illegally merely by putting the candidates on the record and reporting their positions.

My attorneys tell me we are under a gag rule and cannot go in to too many details or even tell you with what we have been charged and where the charges originated.

But I can say there have been at least two complaints filed in two different states against our issue discussion activities.

They claim we are in violation of various FEC rules and laws.

Their allegations are completely false.  And we must fight back now, or they will win and be able to silence our movement.

You see, the Washington, D.C. establishment doesn't like to be challenged.  They hate it when we fight back.

They are absolutely BESIDE themselves when we are winning.

In less than 2 years, your Campaign for Liberty has become a major force on the American political landscape.

I can give you a list of our accomplishments, talk about our growth (we are approaching half a million members), and show you press coverage from across the nation on our efforts.

But nothing shows our success more than how our enemies react when challenged.

When that happens, they do what they do best: use the power of the federal government to attack us.

They want to do one of two things: shut us up, or shut us down.

This battle is over a very fundamental idea - that Campaign for Liberty and our members should have a voice in lobbying their legislators and exposing the radical views of candidates for office.

Exposing what they're up to - that's what the powers that be can't stand.  That's because they don't want Americans to know:

** Congress is spending at a record pace and has now left us over 13 TRILLION dollars in debt, with no end in sight.

** The out of control FED has not accounted for nearly 2 trillion dollars and has doubled our monetary base, risking our entire economy.

** The federal government has imposed a mandate that every American either purchase a health care product the Feds approve of, costing tens of thousands of dollars, or risk fines and jail time.

** The federal government has attempted to take away your 1st, 2nd and 4th Amendment rights, all in the past year, with more certainly to come.

We're exposing them - and holding them accountable as they come back home to seek reelection.

Of course, this may not sound like the end of the world.  But just think: the FEC has an ARMY of lawyers and a budget of nearly $70 MILLION dollars.

That's a lot of lawyers.

And add to it the fact that this group of people is adamantly against free speech under the First Amendment, and well, you have a recipe for trouble.

Subpeonas.  Depositions.  Fishing expeditions that cover tens of thousands of documents.

Legal fees just to defend our right to free speech.

Thousands of hours of staff time to comply with their demands.

You can see where this is going.

If FEC radicals succeed, I will not even be allowed to tell you and your neighbors how candidates for the House and Senate (or for President in the future) have voted on Liberty issues, so you can put the heat on them when they are most likely to listen.

Let me explain that a bit more.

For the first time ever, there is a nationwide group that is dedicated to holding politicians accountable for their votes on Liberty issues. 

It's Campaign for Liberty, and our over 450,000 members are doing battle across the country to hold the politicians' feet to the fire.

Whether it is getting more than 300 sponsors for Audit the Fed, or lobbying to stop Cap and Tax and Real ID schemes, Campaign for Liberty is making a difference.

And we're prepared to make an even bigger difference this fall, as the time comes to inform the people where their candidates stand.

So the statists in Washington are out to make sure that doesn't happen.

Their main weapon is the Federal Election Commission.

The FEC has always been against free speech and a tool of the powerful elite in Washington, who desperately seek to hang on to power.

But as bad as the FEC has been since its inception, with the Obama Administration in power, you and I face even more aggressive assaults on our free speech.

My attorneys have warned me that the puppets at the Federal Election Commission are ordering me to stop mobilizing hundreds of thousands of Americans against power grabs in Congress.

In doing so, they are trying to cripple our ability to stop dangerous legislation in Congress.  If we continue to oppose these Liberty-stealing bills as we have in the past, I face the danger of multimillion-dollar fines and even a jail term!

In fact, I may even be questioned in court for writing this letter tonight.

I must make a decision soon.  Should I allow the Federal Election Commission to tie my hands during this crucial election year? 

Or should I defy their gag-rule regulations . . . and face prosecution from the out of control federal authorities for exercising our right to political speech?

Please give me your answer by filling out the Declaration of Support.

If you and other members want me to proceed with our efforts to inform the public of the positions of your candidates on Liberty issues, and to oppose legislation in the Congress (and I hope you do), I will also need your financial help. 

So please consider making a generous contribution - even if you can only afford to chip in $10 - to help Campaign for Liberty continue this fight.

The fact is the enemies of Liberty are preparing for a political attack far more serious than their election power grab of 2008, in which they put in power some of the biggest enemies of freedom and promoters of Big Government in a generation. 

Our program to stop more statist takeovers in Congress is simple.  By mobilizing our grassroots army, we can put a lot of heat on individual Congressmen and Senators.

The FEC insists we can't do that during election years. 

They say by telling you where your Congressman and Senators stand, I may influence your vote.  The FEC election regulators contend that's illegal electioneering.

Basically, government bureaucrats and their out of control regulations insist I dismantle our lobbying operation during election years -- precisely at the time it would have its greatest impact.

Top legal experts tell me that this harassment by the FEC and any attempts to shut down our program violate several decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and are flatly unconstitutional.

But they also warn me that if I challenge the FEC ruling, I may face a huge, tax-funded lawsuit which could stretch on for decades and cost us as much as a million dollars.

In addition to potential million-dollar fines and legal penalties, I also face an enormous funding challenge. 

Our program to fight back in Congress will require at least $3.2 million.

So there are a lot of decisions to make, and I wanted to be sure I have your support as we move forward.

If I am to proceed with this effort (which I am hoping you will allow), I will need more than just your authorization.  I will need your financial support as well.

I'm hoping you will be able to help with a special contribution - even if you can only afford to chip in $10 - to help Campaign for Liberty continue this fight.

Every dollar, every quarter, every dime will be used to defeat dangerous Liberty-stealing schemes in Congress and in all 50 states.

This is one of the most far-reaching questions I have ever had to pose to you.  The future of Campaign for Liberty is at stake.

If our people are heard, I am sure Liberty will once again thrive in our country.  And we are making great strides in even just the past year.

So please, act today.  If you believe our voices should be heard, and that the federal government CANNOT be allowed to silence them, it's vital you answer today.

Please fill out your Declaration of Support, and consider making a generous contribution - even if you can only afford to chip in $10 - to help Campaign for Liberty continue this fight.

Thank you for all you do for Liberty.

In Liberty,

John Tate

President

PS: Your Declaration of Support and your maximum possible contribution today will ensure Campaign for Liberty will be able to keep fighting this election year.

Just like in 2008, the establishment and statists are desperate to shut us up or shut us down.  They don't want to have their records exposed.

I know a lot of you bitch out what you think is a true free market on reddit, but we've not had a free-market in America for over 100+ years. 
My friend argues a lot that the founding fathers never foresaw the massive corporations that we have these days, and thus didn't know that they should have regulated them. This is quite a bunch of BS because during the founding fathers existence, one of the largest corporations in existence was alive and well, and in-fact, was part of the reasoning that sparked the Boston Tea Party. 
As stated here ( http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/related/teaact.htm ), The Tea Act of 1773 was written almost entirely by the British government to help prop up the floundering East India Company, who had such a large overstock of tea, that they attempted to force it onto the American Colonies. So, to say that the Founding Fathers had no idea what massive corporations were capable of is ridiculous. 
My friend also argues that the founding fathers should have written a bill of right to protect against corporations, but he only believes this because he doesn't understand what the founding fathers were attempting to do. 
Our founding fathers understood at the time that the best way to prevent corrupt businesses, was to prevent corrupt government. If you give the government to ability to regulate business, they will undoubtedly be bribed by businesses to write laws in that businesses own favor. After all, governments are people, and people are fallible. Simply TELLING businesses what they can't do with a law, gives government a foothold into telling them what they can do. The founding fathers DID understand this, and that was why we had the original bill of rights. Many founding members were afraid that by not telling the government what they couldn't do, they would automatically assume that they could do it. Unfortunately, because no one wrote an amendment that said ""Congress, and the various branches, shall have NO power to regulate private businesses and interrupt the natural laws that govern them"", congress decided this meant they should regulate them.
Because congress feels it can grant businesses special privileges, congressmen get bribed and it often completely defeats the purpose of regulating the business in the first place. This is why the federal government should have (followed the constitution and) completely stayed out of business. There is my rant, I expect many flames and probably no up-votes.

Economics,Unemployment compensation in the US -- a discussion of typical eligibility requirements and how they work in practice,"The lack of further extension of federal unemployment benefits in the US is a bit disconcerting against the backdrop of [charts like the one shown in this article, recently posted in the subreddit.](http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2010/07/unemployment?page=1)

I gather the general wisdom underlying the lack of political will to push something like this through is as follows: paying the unemployed gives them less incentive to look for work, and thus hampers economic recovery while adding to the budget deficit.

However, I've come across something curious in my nascent investigation of unemployment policy in the US -- perhaps you can all help me dig into this further, either by referring me to better educational resources or even talking about personal experiences in the collection of unemployment benefits.

The idea that's sparked my curiosity is this, [quoted from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_insurance#Application_process): ""To begin a claim, the unemployed worker must apply for benefits through a state unemployment agency...Generally, the certification includes affected person affirming that they are ""able and available for work"", the amount of any part-time earnings they may have had, **and whether they are actively seeking work.**""

I can see why many would have qualms with giving people money when they aren't working, but if that's directly attached to an incentive to keep looking for work, it seems as if it should be much more palatable politically. What I'm wondering is, how does this work in practice? How do State/the federal governments go about verifying that the unemployment benefit recipient is looking for work?

If government offices are actually helping unemployed individuals formulate resumes and target companies to send them to, that would be fantastic -- even if there aren't many unfilled jobs out there, the point is to maximize the number of people who can possibly be employed, and at least allow those who cannot be employed to participate in the economy on the demand side. Given that such a provision isn't raised very often in our discourse on unemployment in the US, is it broken somehow, causing everyone to sweep its importance under the rug? Some States requiring it, others not?",finance,2010-07-15,-0.0190988559819502

Economics,The Last World War Helped the Economy: Why Not Another One?,"There is overwhelming agreement among economists that the Second World War was responsible for decisively ending the Great Depression. When asked why the wars in Iran and Afghanistan are failing to make the same impact today, they often claim that the current conflicts are simply too small to be economically significant.

There is, of course, much irony here. No one argues that World War II, with its genocide, tens of millions of combatant casualties, and wholesale destruction of cities and regions, was good for humanity. But the improved American economy of the late 1940s seems to illustrate the benefits of large-scale government stimulus. This conundrum may be causing some to wonder how we could capture the good without the bad.

If one believes that government spending can create economic growth, then the answer should be simple: let's have a huge pretend war that rivals the Second World War in size. However, this time, let's not kill anyone.

Most economists believe that massive federal government spending on tanks, uniforms, bullets, and battleships used in World War II, as well the jobs created to actually wage the War, finally put to an end the paralyzing ""deflationary trap"" that had existed since the Crash of 1929. Many further argue that war spending succeeded where the much smaller New Deal programs of the 1930s had fallen short.

The numbers were indeed staggering. From 1940 to 1944, federal spending shot up more than six times from just $9.5 billion to $72 billion. This increase led to a corresponding $75 billion expansion of US nominal GDP, from $101 billion in 1940 to $175 billion by 1944. In other words, the war effort caused US GDP to increase close to 75% in just four years!

The War also wiped out the country's chronic unemployment problems. In 1940, eleven years after the Crash, unemployment was still at a stubbornly high 8.1%. By 1944, the figure had dropped to less than 1%. The fresh influx of government spending and deployment of working-age men overseas drew women into the workforce in unprecedented numbers, thereby greatly expanding economic output. In addition, government spending on wartime technology produced a great many breakthroughs that impacted consumer goods production for decades.

So, why not have the United States declare a fake war on Russia (a grudge match that is, after all, long overdue)? Both countries could immediately order full employment and revitalize their respective manufacturing sectors. Instead of live munitions, we could build all varieties of paint guns, water balloons, and stink bombs.

Once new armies have been drafted and properly outfitted with harmless weaponry, our two countries could stage exciting war games. Perhaps the US could mount an amphibious invasion of Kamchatka (just like in Risk!). As far as the destruction goes, let's just bring in Pixar and James Cameron. With limitless funds from Washington, these Hollywood magicians could surely produce simulated mayhem more spectacular than Pearl Harbor or D-Day. The spectacle could be televised- with advertising revenue going straight to the government.

The competition could be extended so that the winner of the pseudo-conflict could challenge another country to an all-out fake war. I'm sure France or Italy wouldn't mind putting a few notches in the 'win' column. The stimulus could be never-ending.

If the US can't find any willing international partners, we could always re-create the Civil War. Missed the Monitor vs. the Merrimack the first time? No worries, we'll do it again!

But to repeat the impact of World War II today would require a truly massive effort. Replicating the six-fold increase in the federal budget that was seen in the early 1940s would result in a nearly $20 trillion budget today. That equates to $67,000 for every man, woman, and child in the country. Surely, the tremendous GDP growth created by such spending would make short work of the so-called Great Recession.

The big question is how to pay for it. To a degree that will surprise many, the US funded its World War II effort largely by raising taxes and tapping into Americans' personal savings. Both of those avenues are nowhere near as promising today as they were in 1941.

Current tax burdens are now much higher than they were before the War, so raising taxes today would be much more difficult. The ""Victory Tax"" of 1942 sharply raised income tax rates and allowed, for the first time in our nation's history, taxes to be withheld directly from paychecks. The hikes were originally intended to be temporary but have, of course, far outlasted their purpose. It would be unlikely that Americans would accept higher taxes today to fund a real war, let alone a pretend one.

That leaves savings, which was the War's primary source of funding. During the War, Americans purchased approximately $186 billion worth of war bonds, accounting for nearly three quarters of total federal spending from 1941-1945. Today, we don't have the savings to pay for our current spending, let alone any significant expansions. Even if we could convince the Chinese to loan us a large chunk of the $20 trillion (on top of the $1 trillion we already owe them), how could we ever pay them back?

If all of this seems absurd, that's because it is. War is a great way to destroy things, but it's a terrible way to grow an economy.

What is often overlooked is that war creates hardship, and not just for those who endure the violence. Yes, US production increased during the Second World War, but very little of that was of use to anyone but soldiers. Consumers can't use a bomber to take a family vacation.

The goal of an economy is to raise living standards. During the War, as productive output was diverted to the front, consumer goods were rationed back home and living standards fell. While it's easy to see the numerical results of wartime spending, it is much harder to see the civilian cutbacks that enabled it.

The truth is that we cannot spend our way out of our current crisis, no matter how great a spectacle we create. Even if we spent on infrastructure rather than war, we would still have no means to fund it, and there would still be no guarantee that the economy would grow as a result.


What we need is more savings, more free enterprise, more production, and a return of American competitiveness in the global economy. Yes, we need Rosie the Riveter - but this time she has to work in the private sector making things that don't explode. To do this, we need less government spending, not more.",finance,2010-07-20,-0.0567391745341218

READ TO THE VERY END!   VERY ENLIGHTENING!
AND VERY DISTURBING!!!


By Dewie Whetsell,  Alaskan Fisherman. 
As posted in comments on Greta's article referencing the MOVEON ad about Sarah Palin.

The last 45 of my 66 years I've spent in a commercial fishing town in Alaska.  I understand Alaska politics but never understood national politics well until this last year.  Here's the breaking point: Neither side of the Palin controversy gets it.  It's not about persona, style, rhetoric, it's about doing things.  Even Palin supporters never mention the things that I'm about to mention here.
 
1. Democrats forget when Palin was the Darling of the Democrats, because as soon as Palin took the Governor's office away from a fellow Republican and tough SOB, Frank Murkowski, she tore into the Republican's ""Corrupt Bastards Club"" (CBC) and sent them packing. Many of them are now residing in State housing and wearing orange jump suits The Democrats reacted by skipping around the yard, throwing confetti and singing, ""la la la la"" (well, you know how they are). Name another governor in this country that has ever done anything similar. 

2. Now with the CBC gone, there were fewer Alaskan politicians to protect the huge, giant oil companies here. So she constructed and enacted a new system of splitting the oil profits called ""ACES."" Exxon (the biggest corporation in the world) protested and Sarah told them, ""don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out."" They stayed, and Alaska residents went from being merely wealthy to being filthy rich. Of course, the other huge international oil companies meekly fell in line. Again, give me the name of any other governor in the country that has done anything similar.

3. The other thing she did when she walked into the governor's office is she got the list of State requests for federal funding for projects, known as ""pork."" She went through the list, took 85% of them and placed them in the ""when-hell-freezes-over"" stack. She let locals know that if we need something built, we'll pay for it ourselves. Maybe she figured she could use the money she got from selling the previous governor's jet because it was extravagant.

Maybe she could use the money she saved by dismissing the governor's cook (remarking that she could cook for her own family), giving back the State vehicle issued to her, maintaining that she already had a car, and dismissing her State- provided security force (never mentioning - I imagine - that she's packing heat herself). I'm still waiting to hear the names of those other governors.

4. Now, even with her much-ridiculed ""gosh and golly"" mannerism, she also managed to put together a totally new approach to getting a natural gas pipeline built 
that will be the biggest private construction project in the history of North America. No one else could do it, although they tried. If that doesn't impress you, then you're trying too hard to be unimpressed watching her do things like this while baking up a batch of brownies with her other hand.
 
5. For 30 years, Exxon held a lease to do exploratory drilling at a place called Point Thompson. They made excuses the entire time why they couldn't start drilling. In truth, they were holding it like an investment. No governor for 30 years could make them get started. Then, she told them she was revoking their lease and kicking them out. They protested and threatened court action. She shrugged and reminded them that she knew the way to the court house.  Alaska won again.
 
6. President Obama wants the nation to be on 25% renewable resources for electricity by 2025. Sarah went to the legislature and submitted her plan for Alaska to be at 50% renewable by 2025. We are already at 25%. I can give you more specifics about things done, as opposed to style and persona. Everybody wants to be cool, sound cool, look cool. But that's just a cover-up. I'm still waiting to hear from liberals the names of other governors who can match what mine has done in two and a half years. I won't be holding my breath.
 
By the way, she was content to return to AK after the national election and go to work, but the haters wouldn't let her. Now these adolescent screechers are obviously not scuba divers. And no one ever told them what happens when you continually jab and pester a barracuda. Without warning, it will spin around and tear your face off. Shoulda known better.

You have just read the truth about Sarah Palin that sends the media, along with the Democrat party, into a wild uncontrolled frenzy to discredit her. I guess they are only interested in skirt chasers, dishonesty, immoral people, liars, womanizers, murderers, and bitter ex-presidents' wives.
 
So, ""You go, Girl."" I only wish the men in Washington had your guts, determination, honesty, and morals.     
I rest my case. Only FOOLS listen to the biased media.  

 If you've read this far  ...............................   Now,
open your eyes!!

#17 wasn't doing a good enough job???)
(This is community organizing at it's finest.)
There has NEVER been anyone in the White House at any time who has created such an army of staffers whose sole duties are the facilitation of the First Lady's social life. One wonders why she needs so much help,at taxpayer expense, when even Hillary, only had three; Jackie Kennedy one; Laura Bush one; 
and prior to Mamie Eisenhower, social help 
came from the President's own pocket.
Note: This does not include makeup artist Ingrid Grimes-Miles, 49, and ""First Hairstylist"" Johnny Wright, 31, both of whom traveled aboard Air Force One to  Europe  .

After fellow minimal government proponent (and US Senate candidate in my home state of CT) Peter Schiff gained notoriety for his accurate 2008 economic predictions by advocating the same positions, I thought that the mainstream's propulsion of minimal government ideas couldn't get any better.

Apparently, I was right.

The Tea Party movement is an utter disgrace. It is a group of activists who were not raising a single finger when Republicans were engaging in the same out of control spending as the Democrats are now. They take no meaningful stance on foreign policy, and every rally I've seen has been filled with hateful, immoral home-made signs espousing racism, religion, and non-objective intolerance.

Believe me: I'm all about small government and laissez-faire capitalism, but the Tea Party movement is an utter bastardization of these ideas. Anybody who cannot understand why racism and religion are incompatible with capitalism is not only a fool, but a danger to the very legitimate quest many Americans have for a separation of state and economy.",finance,2010-07-28,-0.430084520209004

politics,"In light of the recent actions of the Federal judge striking down many portions of the  Arizona Immigration Law, I would like to share a story...","From my point of view, it seems that there are some who are having a difficult time understanding the central point of the Arizona Immigration Law debate.  Here's a different way to re-frame this discussion and put it into the context of the now controversial Arizona immigration law that is partially blocked:

Let us suppose that a family of five is living and working near Phoenix, Arizona. This family of five is of Mexican descent--Juan is 40 his wife Maria is 35; they have three children aged 10, 8 and 6. Juan works as an accountant for a local tax-preparation company and Maria works as a local elementary school teacher. Essentially, they are living the American dream.

One late night, Maria asks Juan to go to the gas station a few blocks over and pickup a gallon of milk. Juan grabs his keys and drives to the nearest Mobil, purchases a gallon of milk and drives home. Less than two blocks from his home, he is pulled over. Juan's pickup truck does not appear to have any problems nor was he speeding. The police begin to question him and asks him for his driver's license. Being 40 years old, a bit forgetful, and having a long day at work, Juan happened to forget his driver's license at his home.

Juan is now being handcuffed and arrested on suspicion that he is here in the United States illegally. Juan and Maria are actually third generation Mexicans, both of their grandparents immigrated legally near the turn of the twentieth century.

Juan is now in jail. Due to the bureaucratic process, Juan is livid, embarrassed and praying that his employer doesn't find out what has happened. He makes his phone call to his wife who hurries to the police station to display proper identification. The police officers are skeptical that this document has been produced so readily and because it is late at night, they suggest she come back in the morning when they can call other offices to ensure that Juan is who he says he is.

As the bureaucratic storm settles, Juan is who he says he is, is released from prison nearly 24 hours later, humiliated, disgusted and bitter about the whole process, as is his family and friends. Unfortunately, this fiasco has made its way to the local newspaper and Juan has to clear his name with the members of his church and his boss.

Why did Juan get pulled over in the first place? Because he ""looked like"" an illegal immigrant.
No one is arguing that there is a problem with illegal immigration my friends.

The central concern for many who are opposed to this legislation is the methods in which to reinforce this law. Under this legislation, having random stops to ensure persons had their papers IS racial profiling; though the Arizona officials insist that racial profiling would not happen.

Judging someone on the basis of the color of their skin is a despicable act that is utterly reprehensible. I cannot begin to understand how this was nearly a law in 2010.

I don't know what the issue is, it has gotten to the point where I just blatantly refuse to buy SC2 now. I don't know if this has happened to any of you and I'd like to hear about your SC2 experiences. The thing that was great about SC1 was that races where pretty much balanced. Meaning that if you where good you couldn't get killed by any cheap tactics. Below is my argument for the boycott.

**1.** Terran Mech... really I just don't see why this hasn't been nerfed yet...  
**2.** If you are playing a good Terran player they can mass up a pretty big force of marrine/marrauders in the time a pretty good Protoss player can get about 1 immortal, a few stalkers, and maybe a zealot or two.  
**3.** I don't understand how that if siege tanks are outnumbered about 2:1 vs. immortals how the tanks will just completely demolish the immortals.

I did some math on my own income, and compared it to my weekly pay stub. My 2010 taxable income is $40,000. I will actually end up paying $6,181.25 calculated as follows:
1) My first $8,375 of taxable income is taxed at 10%. ($837.50 in tax)
2) From $8,375 to $34,000 is taxed at 15%. ($3,843.75 in tax)
3) From $34,000 to $40,000 I am taxed at 25%. ($1,500 in tax)
4) $837.50 + $3,843.75 + $1,500 = $6,181.25

So far $6,181.25 in taxes for the year, but what about sales taxes? 

I'm going to use a crude model on this one. Lets say that I spend all my money I earn buying things during the year. This example is going to leave out such things as gas tax, which is higher than my states sales tax at 6%, but rolled into the price of gasoline. As stated crude example.

So, $40,000 - $6,181.25 = $33,818.38 

Taxed Income* 6% = $33,818.38 - $2029.13= $31,789.25

$31,789.25/$40,000 = 79% of income kept.

21% goes to the state and federal government, or $8210.38.

Not taking into account tax breaks, credits, or deductions meaning I'll most likely get a refund no matter how small. 

Is $8210.38, or 21% worth paying to live in this country? If not, how much or what percentile do you think is?",energy,2010-07-30,-0.0471601370754136

***

I don't mean to bring up a political argument or anything of the sort; our values are our own.

I do, however, hope that we can all agree to contain the spread of any misinformation as much as it is in our power.  If you feel that the first significant response to the oil crisis was Obama's third trip to the gulf (~57 days after the blowout) that is indeed your prerogative.  But if you're going to bring it up, I am very interested to hear you back it up, and thereby drive closer to truth and fact.

I've included below timeline of the Deepwater Horizon Spill, found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Deepwater_Horizon_oil_spill

Some bullet points I think are valid:

* April 21 (1 day after) Coast Guard (federal government) rear admiral Mary Landry named Federal On Scene Coordinator.

* April 30  (10 days after) - President Barack Obama halts new offshore drilling unless safeguards are in place. – Coast Guard issues subpoena to Transocean ""to maintain the blowout preventer and to not allow anyone or anything to tamper with it"" without the Guard's permission.[44] EPA establishes its website epa.gov/bpspill for its responseOn April 30, the United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce asked Halliburton to brief it as well as provide any documents it might have related to its work on the Macondo well.[48]

I don't mean at all to offer or debate here any opinion on the efficacy or merit of anyone's response to the spill, only to show that it is demonstrably untrue that neither Obama nor the Administration responded to the situation for 57 days.

I hope this information is helpful and that you receive it kindly.

politics,r/Politics: I present to you the speech that brought forth tears of mirth from my teacher's atrophied saline glands...,"My fellow Americans… dark forces gather in our midst. White fog, thick and befuddling, creeps across the political landscape, ensnaring our greatest minds in its malevolent embrace. The streets and corridors of Washington, D.C. are lined with a treacherous, invisible ice. The country sits upon the crest of a slippery slope.

God only knows what lies at the bottom.

Progressivism, liberalism, socialism… Call it what you will. I have another name for it.

Cancer.

My fellow Americans, hear me. Liberals are rotting away the very core of American life. They undermine everything you and I stand for, and seek to destroy the lifestyle that we cherish so dearly. Simply put, liberal thought is the enemy of freedom. 

From whence hath this dark beast cometh? What despicable warren sheltered this awful rodent before it came forth and unleashed its blight upon the world? The American Progressive movement originated during the Industrial Revolution or as I like to call it, The Blissful, Heavenly Golden Rapture of American Society. At any rate, as honest, hardworking folks like John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan were controlling American economy and politics with their rightfully earned monopolies, liberals, or as I like to think of them, sore losers, grew jealous. You see, they didn’t like the fact that American corporations grew rich through unethical business practices such as preferential rebates and predatory pricing. They didn’t like the fact that corporations were powerful enough to treat their workers like slaves. So they began a sickening, underhanded process known as lawful reform. 

Yes that’s right. The Progressives began the tradition of shoving radical changes down the American people’s throats through a democratic majority over one hundred years ago. Disgusting, I know. Liberal reforms of the past have included such travesties as the 40 hour work week, anti-trust and monopoly laws, FDIC insured savings-bank deposits of up to $5,000, the National Parks and Preserves system, and the modernization of impoverished areas through the use of hydroelectric dams. Yes, you heard correctly, my fellow Americans. Liberals gave poor people electricity. What’s next? Giving animals drivers’ licenses?  

As I said before, we stand upon the crest of a slippery slope. And on March 22nd, 2010, a salacious socialist scandal made the slope significantly slipperierer. Slipperier. More slippery.

I speak, of course of health care reform.

Once again, the Progressives, led by a man with a Muslim name, force fed a socialist plot to the American people. With only a 49% approval rating for the measure, and a devious, democratically obtained majority in both the House and Senate, the liberals hammered another government-funded nail into America’s coffin. And know this: More rests upon this issue than fiscal responsibility and the fundamental human right to live healthily. 

My fellow Americans, this is about Freedom, with a capital F.
On March 22nd, 2010, liberals took away my freedom, your freedom… our freedom, to be deprived of health care due to a preexisting condition. Does it not offend your good senses that in America, “The Land of the Free”, you can no longer be kicked off your insurance policy days before a lifesaving operation because you failed to report a case of acne from 11 years ago? 

It hurts me, my fellow Americans, to see what we have become. How many of you have read the book 1984? Ha. Well so have the liberals. Liberals use this book as a sort of road map, a holy text, a bible, if you will, to plot the downfall of American society. And look what they’ve done to us! We no longer have the highest standard of living in the world thanks to liberals! We rank 13th! Have you looked outside lately? Our country is a cultural and economic wasteland! Widespread civil unrest! Martial law!  It’s practically the apocalypse out there! All thanks to SOCIALISM! SOCIALISM I TELL YOU!

And yes, it’s all done in the name of equality… Well, let me tell you, equality isn’t that great. In Kurt Vonnegut’s short story “Harrison Bergeron”, a totalitarian government places artificial handicaps upon all of its people in order to ensure that no one has an unfair advantage over another. Well as soon as the Progressives got a whiff of this scheme, they started cooking up their own recipe for equality soup. According to my favorite news source, www.realconspiracytheories.com, the U.S. Government is currently developing RFID chips so small that they can be dispersed into the water supply and absorbed into your bloodstream every time you drink a glass of water. Soon, these devices will be activated in order to scramble the brainwaves of honest, hardworking Americans until they become dependent on social welfare programs. 

My fellow Americans, I beseech you. Don’t swallow the sugarcoated, silver-tongued sophisms of suspicious charlatans. My fellow Americans, we are on a dark path, and our course must be diverted.  So join me. Fight the ignorance. Strike back. Write a letter to your congressman. Join your local anti-Tax Tea Party. Watch FOX News. Become a fan of Sarah Palin on Facebook. Get your friends together and wave American flags at traffic. But whatever you do don’t vote because that’s another socialist plot. My fellow Americans, this is not about simple freedom. It is about you and I, coming together as fellow Americans, uniting under this beautiful flag, and awaiting the return of Ronald Reagan and Barry Goldwater on a cloud of conservative fire to restore this country to a pristine waterfall of trickle-down economics and old-fashioned family values.

EDIT: Wow, did not think this would get big. Okay, changed a few of the lines to be more clear/accurate including Cuba travel and f-22.

Also, to clarify, this isn't a list of what I think are good things, but rather just a listing of what has been done. I do think it is a bit unfair to put all of this as Obama's doing as congress had a huge role in most of these, however it is how the public generally treats the government. On the other hand, Obama wrote many of these as executive orders and for others spent time with members of congress to shape the legislation. If anyone finds a case of Obama speaking out against one of the events listed, I'll take it off.

Finally, since there seems to be a bit of interest, I may do a GWB version. Although it will probably be harder to wrangle all of the information as the last administration wasn't as tech-oriented.


EDIT2: Just to make it clear, I wouldn't be what most of you would think of as an Obama supporter. I didn't vote for him in 2008 as I didn't believe that he would be able to accomplish much of what he promised, and as well I continue to have disagreements with many of his policies. Despite this, I have went from skeptic to being genuinely surprised at many of the steps he's taken after many years of things being swept under the rug (republican and democrat alike).

business,"The US economy shed 131,000 jobs in July","The US economy shed 131,000 jobs in July, as weaker-than-expected private sector hiring cast doubt over the recovery.

Official figures showed job losses mounting for the second month running, following five consecutive months of gains from the start of the year. Wall Street analysts had predicted that payrolls would fall by 65,000 in July, leaving the month’s losses twice as severe as feared.

EDITOR’S CHOICE
New claims for US jobless benefits jump - Aug-05.ADP says US companies add 42,000 jobs - Aug-04.Faltering US recovery trips dollar - Aug-03.Reportage: US middle-class crisis - Jul-30.Lex: US public sector layoffs - Aug-02..Meanwhile, a separate survey showed that the unemployment rate held steady at 9.5 per cent, as discouraged workers who gave up on their job searches left the labour force smaller. 

The jobless rate remains the most closely watched measure of the economy’s health and the biggest political liability for Barack Obama, president. With pressure mounting ahead of midterm elections, the Obama administration has argued that without its policies, job losses would have been more severe.

Investors were rattled by the disappointing data. S&amp;P 500 futures, which were edging higher before the report, fell 0.5 per cent to 1,117.6 and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were down 0.5 per cent to 10,579. The yield on US Treasuries fell, with two-year bonds down by 2 basis points to yield 0.514 per cent, and 10-year bonds falling 4 basis points to 2.86 per cent. 

The US lost more than 8m jobs during the recession and 14.6m Americans remain jobless. The private sector has added 630,000 workers so far this year, but the majority of that hiring took place in March and April. 

The dismissal of 143,000 census workers was a drag on payrolls in July, while private sector employment rose by just 71,000. That was weaker than the previous month and trailed economists’ expectations.

There were some bright notes within the report. Economists keep a close watch on wages and hours worked as a gauge of future hiring, and last month the length of the average work week inched up while hourly earnings rose by 4 cents to $22.59.

The manufacturing sector added 36,000 jobs during the month and hiring grew in the education and healthcare sectors. However, financial services, construction and government work declined

In a speech earlier this week, Ben Bernanke, chairman of the Federal Reserve, fretted that the recent rate of job creation was “insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially” and that the swelling ranks of the long-term unemployed could have “long-lasting” effects on the labour force.

Economists at Goldman Sachs contend that fears about an increase in “structural” unemployment could be premature. Since the job vacancy rate still remains depressed, they argue, unemployment is largely a product of a lack of available jobs rather than the inability to match workers with openings. 

David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said before the report that he expected the pace of payroll gains to average 200,000 during the second half of the year. He argues that the recent uptick in hiring of temporary workers, which fell in July, along with fewer job cut announcements, means that the labour market could be set to slowly improve.

Economics,What would be problems with nominal GDP targeting?,"Economists like Krugman keep repeating that current economic troubles are caused by liquidity trap and related zero interest rate bound. But everybody knows how to escape deflation - just print more money. Or in a more civilized and controlled way commit central bank to nominal GDP targeting. [Scott Sumner put a good FAQ about it](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?page_id=3447).

Nobody explicitly targeted NGDP before, but [US and nearly all OECD countries were doing de facto just that for the last three decades](http://macromarketmusings.blogspot.com/2009/11/global-nominal-spending-history.html) - except [Japan](http://www.eurekareport.com.au/iis/iis.nsf/6D922FAAD61C43F9CA257638008371A8/$file/090921%20graph%201.PNG), and except now. What's monetary authorities are doing looks too much like [repeat of Great Depression instead](http://www.debtdeflation.com/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/IMG0005_70301897.PNG).

Perhaps purely monetary stimulus from NGDP targeting won't be enough and we'll still need fiscal stimulus on top of that. But why aren't we even trying? I couldn't find any good arguments for downsides of that, from Krugman, Fed, or anyone else.

Are there good reasons not to do so, or is Fed just acting stupid?

A lot of background is in [Sumner's FAQ](http://www.themoneyillusion.com/?page_id=3447) so I won't be repeating it here, but feel free to ask.

EDIT: There's an extra bonus. Currently low real growth and low inflation go together so creditor nations (assuming long term credit) like China don't have any interest in helping debtor nations like US. With NGDP targeting every extra 1% of US growth automatically increases value of Chinese dollars by 1% (about $25bln at the moment), giving China extra incentive to be helpful, at no cost.",finance,2010-08-08,-0.0701894184019219

**tl;dr**: Obama's ""internet kill switch"" bill is back on the table, except this time with his official endorsement, and with the added benefit that ISPs would be totally controlled by federal officials whether or not we're in a time of ""emergency.""

~~~~~~~

Dear Patriot:

Please take your time and read this email carefully.

Because if a bill quietly sneaking its way through Congress passes, an email like this could be the last non-government message to ever hit your inbox.

In fact, someday you may even find yourself unable to log in to your email in the first place!

I know what you're thinking: Maybe this is just another Internet hoax.

I wish it was.

But Barack Obama and Senator Jay Rockefeller (D-WV) want to make this nightmare a reality.  That's why Rockefeller introduced S. 773, ""The Cybersecurity Act of 2009.""

Cosponsors include Senators Evan Bayh (D-IN), Bill Nelson (D-FL) and Olympia Snowe (R-ME).

You see, Barack Obama is seeking sweeping new powers to ""shut down"" all private internet in the event of a ""cybersecurity emergency"" — a vague term that the President can define at his discretion.

And Rockefeller's bill gives Barack Obama just what he wants.

That's why this expansive new power grab should really be called ""The Internet Takeover Bill.""

As you know, the Internet has developed into an independent sphere where 1st Amendment Rights can still be (fairly) freely exercised.

It's also become an important outlet for liberty-minded speech, cutting around the Obama-worship and corporate censorship of the mainstream media.

And we've already seen the Obama Administration's reaction to any online speech they deem ""fishy.""

Last July, the Administration called upon Americans to report their friends' and neighbors' emails to help Barack Obama silence the ""disinformation"" about the Obamacare bills in Congress.

Well now Barack Obama wants to cut out the middle man.

If the Internet Takeover Bill passes, Barack Obama can silence his dissenters directly — by ordering a shutdown of the U.S. Internet.

That's right, under this bill Barack Obama can order all non-government U.S. networks to shutdown from the Internet.

But that's not all.

Even outside of periods of White House-declared ""emergency,"" this bill mandates that private-sector networks only be managed by government-licensed ""cybersecurity professionals.""

If you think dealing with your office IT department is bad now, just wait until they're federally-licensed bureaucrats.

Well I know I like writing to you, and I hope you like hearing from me.

Or if not me, at least you probably like staying in touch with your family and friends, and having access to uncensored news and current events.

And that's why I hope you'll help Campaign for Liberty stop the Internet Takeover Bill by signing our Internet User's Mandate to Congress.

Today, legislation like this — built on the same statist principles as the infamous Patriot Act — must sneak through Congress quietly.

They know Americans are no longer willing to swallow this swill ""for our own good.""

And it's especially critical that Campaign for Liberty and other fellow R3volutionaries fight this power grab.

Can you imagine how easily those in power could fabricate an ""emergency"" on a big money bomb day for a strong liberty candidate threatening the establishment?

Or how about message boards vital to planning and freedom rallies and protests of socialized medicine?

With ""right-wing extremists"" freely and visibly exercising their 2nd Amendment rights at such events, no doubt the White House could declare ""emergency"" and shut down all online planning.

I don't want to see good politicians lose potential millions or demonstrations of liberty extinguished. I hope you don't either.

That's why I hope you'll sign your Internet User's Mandate and make a donation right now to Campaign for Liberty to make sure that never happens.

We're going to fight this bill hard, because it's clear that the Internet is the next frontier for liberty politics, and Campaign for Liberty is right on the forefront.

So please click here to sign your Internet User's Mandate to Congress in opposition to Barack Obama's Internet Takeover and Shutdown Bill.

And in addition to signing your mandate, please make a generous contribution of $100, $50 or $25 so we can fight this Internet takeover.

We need to fight to make sure Barack Obama doesn't disconnect your computer, shut down your favorite websites, or block all your emails.

And frankly with Audit the Fed, Cap and Tax and socialized healthcare debates, Campaign for Liberty is stretched pretty thin.

And unlike the government we don't print, borrow or take money by force (taxes).  Our only revenue comes from voluntary contributions from liberty activists like you.

We need you to stay educated and active.

We've put too much time into building our pro-liberty online networks, websites and email lists.  We simply cannot afford to give Barack Obama the power to dismantle all that at the drop of a hat.

So please, click here to sign your Internet User's Mandate and if you can make a contribution of $100, $50 or $25 or whatever you want to Campaign for Liberty to stop this power grab...

...to defend our rights...

...and most importantly, to protect this movement.

I trust you'll join this fight to protect all the progress we've made.

In Liberty,


John Tate
President

P.S. The Internet Takeover Bill (S. 773) is threatening to ""unplug"" private networks from the Internet on the order of the President and dismantle the online army we've worked so hard to build.

Click here to sign your Internet User's Mandate to Congress, and please make a generous contribution of $100, $50 or $25 to Campaign for Liberty so we can lead the fight against this Obama power grab.

Economics,"Are we approaching a recipe for disaster in the housing market this fall that will lead us into a US ""Lost Decade""?","If, on August 17th, the Treasury suggests that Fannie and Freddie should bail out people who are upside down on their mortgages, how is that not going to be the start of a deeper recession/depression that extends to the end of the decade?

Several articles have mentioned that some 15 million loans [1] may be affected. That's 15 million homes that could enter the market at presumably lower prices than the already existing 4 million homes [2] for sale.

Assuming that even a small percentage (like 10%) of the 15 million homes enter the market as ""for sale"" going into Fall and Winter, historically the worst times to be selling a home [3], isn't adding 1.5 million to the existing 4 million homes for sale just a recipe for disaster? Won't prices of homes plummet even more?

Worse, it's been shown that many of the now-just-starting-to-retire baby boomers have been using home equity as their safe harbor [4] financially. If these folks, like my parents, currently, can not sell their homes at or above the price that they bought them, they are actually **losing** their retirement, which will affect spending habits. Using a home as a source of retirement income isn't unique to baby-boomers, either, other demographics do this, but the baby boomers are unique for two reasons: they are a huge demographic with a significant impact on GDP and they are retiring (spending less). [5]

Still worse is the economy itself being dependent on this massive group spending money, which they have done less and less of. If they slow their spending because the price of the homes they are trying to sell falls, and put their current income into safer investments (like US treasuries) that pay very little, the *the economy as a whole* will suffer due to their lack of spending. The #1 and #2 investments for this demographic are, in fact: Treasuries and CDs [6], two of the worst performing investments right now, but easily the most secure. 

We've seen this before, where a country's debt was ultimately changed from being held by foreigners into being held domestically, and what it did to the country [7], but this isn't the only thing we have in common with that case. Japan's ""Lost Decade"" [8] was generally seen as being a result of the following which are now happening in the US:

1. Large aging demographic block. Check.
2. Housing crisis from low interest rates into higher interest rates. Check.
3. Financial institutions failing despite lowered interest rates. Check.
4. Largest financial institutions seen as too-big-to-fail. Check.
5. Bailouts and propping up of ""zombie banks"" [9]. Check.
6. Conspicuous consumption [10] turns into a paradox of thrift [11]. As of this Fall? Perhaps.

While several of the points (#1-5) were readily apparent, I never understood where the last (#6) was going to come from. It always seemed to me that because the interest rates were so low eventually whatever savings existed would go into investments in the market and elsewhere. Plus, we all know that most of us have been ""spoiled"" and we would love to go back to being so.

However, a few weeks back these numbers started coming out that showed with the baby boomers putting all their money into their houses, there really wasn't any savings left. Now, with the almost certainty of a housing glut following the complete bailout of Fannie &amp; Freddie and the underwater mortgages, this is the final nail in the coffin to bring about the last point.

It is important to note that what is going to kill the economy over the next decade isn't retirement alone, here, it's the reduced spending on the market and increased saving in buying US debt by this large demographic (among others). Falling house prices this fall are going to send us into spiral from which it will be increasingly difficult to get out of, and our government seems poised to kick the first domino sometime next week.

Economics,Tax Hikes,"I recently received the following chain e-mail. I know that a lot of it is incorrect and would like to know r/economics feelings on what is stated within.  I am researching some of this myself because I would like to make an educated response to the person who sent it to me.

In just six months, the largest tax hikes in the history of America will
take effect. They will hit families and small businesses in three great
waves on January 1, 2011:
     
First Wave:  Expiration of 2001 and 2003 Tax Relief
     
In 2001 and 2003, the GOP Congress enacted several tax cuts for investors,
small business owners, and families.   

These will all expire on January 1, 2011:

Personal income tax rates will rise.  The top income tax rate will rise from
35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which two-thirds of small
business profits are taxed).  The   lowest rate will rise from 10 to 15
percent.  All the rates in between will also rise.  Itemized deductions and
personal exemptions will again phase out, which has the same mathematical
effect as higher marginal tax rates.  The full list of marginal rate hikes
is below:

      * The 10% bracket rises to an expanded 15%
      * The 25% bracket rises to 28%
      * The 28% bracket rises to 31%
      * The 33% bracket rises to 36%
      * The 35% bracket rises to 39.6%

Higher taxes on marriage and family.  The ""marriage penalty"" (narrower tax
brackets for married  couples) will return from the first dollar of income.
The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child.  The
standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to
the single level.  The dependent care and adoption tax credits will be cut.
     
The return of the Death Tax.   This year, there is no death tax.  For those
dying on or after January 1 2011, there is a 55 percent top death tax rate
on estates over $1 million.  A person leaving behind two homes and a
retirement account could easily pass along a death tax bill to their loved
ones.

Higher tax rates on savers and investors. The capital gains tax will rise
from 15 percent this year to 20 percent in 2011.  The dividends tax will
rise from 15 percent this year to 39.6 percent in 2011.  These rates will
rise another 3.8 percent in 2013.

Second Wave:  Obamacare
     
There are over twenty new or higher taxes in Obamacare.  Several will first
go into effect on January 1, 2011.  They include:
     
The ""Medicine Cabinet Tax""   Thanks to Obamacare, Americans will no longer
be able to use health savings account (HSA),  flexible spending account
(FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase
non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin).

The ""Special Needs Kids Tax""  This provision of Obamacare imposes a cap on
flexible spending accounts (FSAs)  of $2500  (Currently, there is no federal
government limit).  There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap
will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children.
There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United
States,  and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education.
Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs childrenin
Washington , D.C. (National Child Research Center) can easily exceed $14,000
per year.  Under tax rules, FSA dollars can not be used to pay for this type
of special needs education. 

The HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike.   This provision of Obamacare increases the
additional tax on non-medical early withdrawal from an HSA from 10 to 20
percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged
accounts, which remain at 10 percent.



Third Wave:  The Alternative Minimum Tax and Employer Tax Hikes
     
When Americans prepare to file their tax returns in January of 2011,
they'll be in for a nasty surprise-the AMT won't be held harmless, and many
tax relief provisions will have expired.   

The major items include:
     
The AMT  will ensnare over 28 million families, up from 4 million last year.
According to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center, Congress' failure to index
the AMT will lead to an explosion of AMT taxpaying families-rising from 4
million last year to 28.5 million.   



These families will have to calculate their tax burdens twice, and pay taxes
at the higher level. The AMT was created in 1969 to ensnare a handful of
taxpayers. Small business expensing will be slashed and 50% expensing will
disappear.   Small businesses can normally expense (rather than
slowly-deduct, or ""depreciate"") equipment purchases up to $250,000.  This
will be cut all the way down to $25,000.  Larger businesses can expense half
of their purchases of equipment.  In January of 2011, all of it will have to
be ""depreciated.""


Taxes will be raised on all types of businesses.  There are literally scores
of tax hikes on business that will take place.  The biggest is the loss of
the ""research and experimentation tax credit,"" but there are many, many
others.  Combining high marginal tax rates with the loss of this tax relief
will cost jobs.  Tax Benefits for Education and Teaching Reduced.   The
deduction for tuition and fees will not be available.  Tax credits for
education will be limited.  Teachers will no longer be able to deduct
classroom expenses.  Coverdell Education Savings Accounts will be cut.
Employer-provided educational assistance is curtailed.  The student loan
interest deduction will be disallowed for hundreds of thousands of families.

Charitable Contributions from IRAs no longer allowed.  Under current law, a
retired person with an IRA can contribute up to $100,000 per year directly
to a charity from their IRA.  This  contribution also counts toward an
annual ""required minimum distribution.""  This ability will no longer be
there.

Now your insurance is INCOME on your W2's......
                                         
One of the surprises we'll find come next year, is what follows - - a little
""surprise"" that 99% of us had no idea was included in the ""new and improved""
healthcare legislation . . . the dupes, er, dopes, who backed this
administration will be astonished!   
       
Starting in 2011, (next year folks), your W-2 tax form sent by your employer
will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are
given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or
governmental body of some sort.  If you're retired?  So what; your gross
will go up by the amount of insurance you get.
           
You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have
never seen.  Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or
$20,000 additional gross does to your  tax debt.  That's what you'll pay
next year.  For many, it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's
even worse.
           
This is how the government is going to buy insurance for the15% that don't
have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases.
           
Not believing this???  Here is a research of the summaries.....
           
On page 25 of 29: TITLE IX REVENUE PROVISIONS- SUBTITLE A: REVENUE OFFSET
PROVISIONS-(sec. 9001, as modified by sec. 10901) Sec.9002  ""requires
employers to include in the W-2 form of each employee the aggregate cost of
applicable employer sponsored group health coverage that is excludable from
the employees gross income.""

Economics,Hey /r/Economics: I'm having a hard time answering myself this one. What's more likely for the US... Deflation or Hyperinflation?,"Hey everyone, thanks for viewing my post. To nutshell myself, I'm a working class Canadian with a major penchant for investing and building/protecting wealth.

With everything that's been going on in the United States, I think it's safe to say that those people are going to be feeling some economic pain. With all of it's crumbling infrastructure, corrupt politicians, declining morale, increased monetary frivolousness, it paints a pretty grim picture.

Being a Canadian, it's obvious that I should be concerned. As this is going to have some serious ramifications on America's Hat.

But I just can't put my finger on it. Just HOW is America going to be feeling this pain? Hyperinflation(or simple stagflation) or Deflation?

In the case of hyperinflation, much of the signs point to it. This is primarily due to the Federal Reserve having absolute damn domain over the entire money supply. Base money has doubled (Or IIRC, Tripled) in just the span of a couple of years, and Outstanding Revolving Credit has pretty much gone exponential on the charts. Furthermore, the prices of necessities, such as food and real estate, are becoming less and less affordable thanks to wages not keeping up. What has me wondering most about it was how quickly the last stock market crash recovered, hell, even exceeded, value than whence it crashed. Seems like serious intervention. Furthermore, Ben Bernanke is anti-deflation. He's doing everything he can to prevent it from happening again.

On the other hand, there have been free market signs of deflation. No need to point out that recent stock market crash. Where the US dollar was strong and every damned thing collapsed instead. Prices of a lot of other things, such as electronics and non-need items, have been dropping in value as well. Deflation also seems like a possible outcome, especially if the Fed decides to call back all loans and contract all of that standing revolving credit. It would appear that the Fed also contracts a certain amount to prevent too much inflation. But because of monetary policies after the market crash, too little effort on the Fed's part might bring about this deflation at it's fullest.

It's almost like a clash between government intervention and free markets.

I have no clue which of the two could happen. It's overwhelming. With the way I've presented myself, I'm sure as heck no expert. Perhaps to help me decide on how to hedge myself, I humbly come before Reddit to receive some insight, thoughts, analysis and opinions from you all with the following question.

What's more likely: Deflation, or Hyperinflation? And what should I do to prepare for it?

Right now, my only methods of preparation are having food storage and holding equal parts gold and cash in physical form.

If I do seem arrogant on America's decline, I apologize. But you guys are the biggest economic plate. Better to prepare and be wrong than to be caught with my pants down.",finance,2010-08-18,-0.3992356531492847

Looking at Reach, I know that the MLG version will just be DMRs and pistols, with the sprint ability. That's it.

Same goes for Smash Bros Melee/Brawl. Taking out all items doesn't even out the game play. Heck, some characters, (Game and Watch, anyone with a reflect,) are nerfed without items on. It'd be better to just let each player turn off the 3-4 items they hate.",technology,2010-08-18,-0.0686838140015162

politics,How bad are American labor practices?  This bad.,"After reading the ""why don't employers have to give you two weeks' notice"" post, which consisted of replies from American redditors madly trying to defend the lopsided practice while those from other nations said ""uh, you DO have to do that as an employer here,"" it got me thinking. How many American redditors actually know what labor laws are like in the rest of the developed world, and how many non-American redditors know how bad it is here?

Here's some details of the rampant unfairness in the American system:

1) Nope, your employer is NOT required to give you any notice, or any severance pay. Some do provide severance, but that is purely at their discretion and often accompanied with ""sign or you don't get your money"" waivers of corporate liability for your termination. So if you suspect you've been fired for an illegal reason, too bad, if you want to make your rent and car payments you'd better sign on the dotted line.

2) Employers in the U.S. are not required to provide ANY paid time off. No paid sick days, no paid vacation time, no paid maternity leave, no paid federal holidays. Many employers, even most, provide one or more of these things as a courtesy, but the number of employers offering none of them is rising as the unemployment rate rises and people become willing to take any job at all, even one that views its employees as chattel who don't deserve a paid day off once in a while.

3) Do you work for a company with fewer than 15 employees? Your company is allowed (in most states) to discriminate against employees on the basis of race, sex, national origin, pregnancy, et cetera. Title VII of the civil rights act, which prohibits such discrimination, exempts private businesses with fewer than 15 employees. In other words, if you employ only 14 total people, you can simply say ""only white people allowed."" By the way, that 15 number doesn't include independent contractors or partners, so you can have a fairly large employer that is still allowed to discriminate as long as most of the people working there are independent contractors. What's more, no one's agitating to change this.

4) If you receive tips as part of your normal employment, your direct wage is generally $2.13 per hour. Yes, $2.13 an hour. Hope your tips are real nice.

5) Many, MANY jobs are not required to pay any overtime wage regardless of how many hours you work. This doesn't just apply to executives and managers and creative types. Projectionists, carnies, cab drivers, and a host of other occupations are also exempted and require no overtime wage whatsoever.

6) Youth under age 20 in their first 90 days of employment are allowed to make $4.25 an hour.

7) Only 21 of 50 states require ANY meal or rest break time for adult employees (including both paid and unpaid breaks). Four more require breaks for minors but not adults. There is also no federal restriction on how long employers may keep employees at work or how many hours an employer can require of an employee per week. In other words, while most employers do not do this, it is 100% legal in many states to employ someone for a 16 hour shift with no breaks allowed.

In other words: if you're not from the U.S., however bad you thought U.S. labor protections were, they're worse. If you're an American and used to employers who voluntarily provide one or more non-required things, look at the trend in employer/employee relations over the last 10 years: more independent contractors and temps, fewer full time employees with benefits. If you don't think your company will ever stop giving breaks or vacation time, just wait -- after another few years of high unemployment, non-required perquisites will dry up even worse than they already have.

The worst part of this: if this post gets replies, I guarantee a number of them will be from people hastening to tell us why these policies are perfectly okay and how the right of employers to exploit workers in any way is just fine, because employees ""chose"" to work in such a place. We'll hear that if employers were required to provide such things, they would all go out of business and employ fewer people. Nations offering substantially more protection to employees do not seem to have these problems, but that won't stop people from making the argument (or bringing up a single example of a country with good labor laws and high unemployment as PROOF POSITIVE that such a system is non-viable).

People have become so attached to their own oppression that they view it as a badge of honor. They will show up to fight for their employers' right to exploit them. And they will convince themselves that standing up for big companies instead of individual employees is patriotic. They will ask for a little sick leave as supplicants, grateful for the crumbs cast off by an employer who views them as numbers on a ledger.

It doesn't have to be this way. Non-American redditors: what are employment laws like in your country? How much of what I've posted above strikes you as downright awful?",cryptocurrency,2010-08-20,-0.5388564660417829

&gt;The Roads to Fiscal Ruin

&gt; Decline? Or Fall? If the U.S. stays on its present course to fiscal  insolvency, what exactly are we to expect? We should know that a profligate America is an enfeebled America, that if the spending continues, if the debt climbs and the iron laws of compound interest kick in, we face a period of decline. Like some waning empires of the past–Habsburg, Ottoman, British–we will fight a twilight battle to preserve our comfortable way of life while others gradually fill our shoes.

&gt;There's no shortage of people in the world hoping for this outcome; there are plenty in the U.S. who wouldn't be all that upset. It's not the only possibility, however. The exit of other bankrupt regimes from the stage has been a lot bumpier.

&gt;When Louis XVI summoned the Estates-General to Versailles in May of 1789, he did so because the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution had effectively bankrupted him. He was deep in debt and couldn't dig out because the richest estates, the clergy and the nobility, paid little or no tax. When assembled, they remained inflexible, the Third Estate (everyone else) took over, and the French Revolution was under way.

&gt;Exactly 200 years later, another seemingly unshakable regime also collapsed quite suddenly of its own weight. No extreme of brutality could make the Soviet system of collectivized agriculture productive enough to feed its people. A spike in oil prices in the 1970s provided the temporary means to buy foreign grain, but as prices fell, the Soviets became heavy borrowers.

&gt;The jig was up in 1989, when Solidarity took control in Poland and the Soviets failed to intervene. They had no choice. More loans were needed from the West, and borrowing would be impossible if the tanks rolled. Two years later, in December of 1991, after violent internal struggle but without a foreign shot being fired at it, the Supreme Soviet voted to dissolve itself, a month after being informed by the state bank that its foreign reserve balance was exactly zero.

&gt;These were despotic governments that had it coming to them. But Weimar Germany, with its progressive constitution, was the darling of democrats. It had many problems–including war damage, reparations, deep disunity–but the direct agents of its failure were fiscal. The rampant printing of money was the least-resistance way to meet huge budget deficits. The resulting hyperinflation destroyed the foundations of democracy.

&gt;There followed a bitter struggle over German social-welfare policies. To pay for them, German taxes had risen sharply from their prewar levels. The beginning of the end of democracy came in 1930. The last coalition government failed over the issue of tax increases to save the state's unemployment fund, buckling under the 1929-30 economic collapse. Power was thereafter exercised by presidential decree, and passed from hand to hand in the back room to its final destination in the hands of Adolf Hitler.

&gt;History is littered with bad ends to fiscal irresponsibility. Juan Peron in Argentina, Salvador Allende in Chile and Robert Mugabe in Zimbabwe are among the most familiar names who brought their countries to ruin.

&gt;The Qing dynasty of China ended its days in chronic destitution. Two years after its fall, in 1913, the ruling family offered the entire imperial art collection to J.P. Morgan for only $4 million. (He died before he could consider the offer.) Uncountable tens of millions died in the decades of chaos that followed the collapse of that giant empire.

&gt;Bankrupt Europe presents a current spectacle. The street barricade and storming of the palace turn out not to be entirely passé in the digital age. Just as destructive, though, is the rot–the sweeping, visceral revulsion against over-promising government, most complete among those most dependent.

&gt;Can we pride ourselves on the resilience of our democracy? Isn't it true that in our case, unlike those others, when the chips are down and our backs are to the wall, the necessary compromises will be made? Really?

&gt;Actuarially, existing entitlements have already bankrupted us. Mighty and exceptional as we think we are, demography and arithmetic are mightier still. Everyone knows it. They have known it for some time. Yet none of these programs has ever been cut back in a material way, so powerful and tenacious are the attending lobbies.

&gt;We are just where those others were: captive to entrenched special interests that will brook no change to their positions, whatever the long-term danger.

&gt;We may lack others' deep social divisions, but we have our own fissures. The U.S. is a large and diverse country in which the government is mistrusted, consensus is elusive and the political ground, once taken, is defended with the spirit of the pioneer. For sheer intransigence, we can stack the AARP or the trial lawyers up against the most intractable guild or elite of the Old World.

&gt;Before his health-care bill passed, the president said he would turn to the deficit next, that if it passed he would ""own"" it and personally undertake to fix any problem it created. History buffs will be forgiven for a little head-scratching over that one. There's a striking image in Tolstoy's War and Peace of Napoleon aboard the coach of history drawn forward by its racing steeds. The great man imagines himself in control, when in fact he is like a child hanging helplessly to the straps.

&gt;With large new entitlements like Obamacare, the decisive damage is done at the giddy moment when the signing pens are passed around, and the new special interests ""vest."" The rest, as they say, is history.

&gt;It does not promise us a stately and peaceful decline. We will have what others have had: at the very least a divisive and even violent struggle as the crisis mounts. The longer we dither, the worse it will be, fed by the uniquely bitter passions that men have always reserved for governments that betray them, and being bankrupt, are too weak to help themselves.

gaming,"Hey /r/gaming, what do you think of this MMO4X idea I've just had?","I've started playing GalCiv2 lately and this idea just popped into my mind just now. How come we haven't had a proper MMO4X game yet? It seems that the genre is built for it. I did a quick googling and found the now defunct [Celetania](http://www.celetania.com/) (which I've never heard before now) which I'm still not sure how it worked but seemed rather limited if I'm to judge by its techtree and number of races. I'm also aware of many browser based games which offer something similar, but I do not like the way they are done since there doesn't seem to be any meaning of space (anyone can attack whoever)

Anyway, my ideas were mostly influenced by the 4X games I liked most, MOO2 and GalCiv2 as well as [Ian M. Banks'](http://www.iain-banks.net/science-fiction/) type of universe (The one involving The Culture). OK, Enough prologue, here's the idea.

You have a huge auto-generated galaxy. Players start out as cultures which have just achieved warp-speed/hyper-gate/worm-hole/whatev technology which allow them now to go forth and colonize planets outside their solar system. You get the classic kind of customization like in most 4X games (choose your race-type and traits) and if possible the level of ship customization one sees in GalCiv2 (I guess it would be too much to ask the kind of race customization as one has in Spore, but that would be awesome). 

Player races spawn in a generally not very well known part of the galaxy, which will give them enough time to colonize and expand a bit before finding other players. The thing is, that since this is a MMO, you're very likely to find other empires that are miles above you in technology and power and you're not even going to be a blip in the radar unless you have colonized something more than your home planet. 

So anyway, you progress in a very similar way to most 4X games, slowly researching technology and expanding your borders and influence. Since not all players start at the same time, you will always have some that are more or less powerful than you are. Those most powerful might decide to ignore you, conquer you or help you. Depends on where you had the good or bad fortune to spawn.

""Aha"", you say, ""But why wouldn't any Evil Empires/Griefers simply choose to conquer all the minor players before they grow too strong?"". Well first of all, that should be a definite part of the game as it wouldn't be very realistic if new civilizations were not under threat by the nasty ones. But there are realistic ways to limit this so that new players have a chance. The few I've thought of are these:

* Player utilizes a different type of planet. If for example I'm playing a race of Gas Giant dwellers and I'm next to a Terra-type player, being conquered with planetary invasion (I suggest heavy penalties for trying to do battle in a planetary type you're not natural with) would be very difficult and/or costly. These would mean that such a race would either be ignored, or the imperialist race would attempt to make them a vassal. The first case is the better one for the new race but the latter one could also be challenging for the new player. First of all they can continue playing the game as normal but now ""paying"" for some protection. But also it could lead to interesting scenarios such as a number of vassals conspiring to rebel from within. Stuff that are so common in history and yet we never see in 4X games.

* The more helpful races (Think like The Federation in Star Trek, or The Culture of Banks) would protect such new comers and invite them to join their alliance.

* They just happen to be far away from most other races. It could just happen (or it could be an option one selects) that their civilization spawns in a very remote part of the galaxy, allowing them to expand without issues. By the time they find some of the larger races, they will have enough power to defend themselves.

Now, that's all well and good, but what  would the purpose be. Why would someone want to keep playing this game. Well, the way I've thought about it is oriented to people who already like 4X games, and thus replay single player or simple multi-player games anyway. The objectives one could have for an end-game could be many.

* Achieve ascension. At the end of a particular type of the technology tree, one will unlock a technology which will allow them to ""ascend"" as a race, and disappear from the galaxy. Doing so will ""retire"" the civilization, add them to the hall of fame or somesuch, and the player will be able to start again anew. All the planets they controlled will be reset and races which were counting on them for support might find themselves in deep trouble.

* Help out other races in the galaxy. Try to to fend of the imperialist races from subduing everyone else.

* Try and dominate the rest of the galaxy. This will probably be the most difficult to attain and maintain. Given how much end-game playtime is taken up just by this goal in EvE Online, I think that in a 4X game, this would be even more exciting.

* Take part in events. The DMs of the game could regularly schedule events such as elder races invading from another galaxy. Super powerful artifacts appearing that people try to control etc. 

I've had a few other thoughts on this (such as on how research would work and so on) but I think I've written quite a bit already and I'd like to hear your opinions. What do you think?",technology,2010-08-23,-0.0085103821722766

The email is as follows:

&gt; ""2011 TAXES

&gt; BELIEVE IT OR NOT:  2011 Taxes

&gt; In just six months, the largest tax hikes in the history of America will take effect.  They will hit families and small businesses in three great waves on January 1, 2011:

&gt; **First Wave: Expiration of 2001 and 2003 Tax Relief**
 
&gt; In 2001 and 2003, the GOP Congress enacted several tax cuts for investors, small business owners, and families.
 
&gt; These will all expire on January 1, 2011:
 
&gt; Personal income tax rates will rise.  The top income tax rate will rise from 35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which two-thirds of small business profits are taxed).  The lowest rate will rise from 10 to 15 percent.  All the rates in between will also rise.  Itemized deductions and personal exemptions will again phase out, which has the same mathematical effect as higher marginal tax rates.  The full list of marginal rate hikes is below:
 
&gt; - The 10% bracket rises to an expanded 15%
&gt; - The 25% bracket rises to 28%
&gt; - The 28% bracket rises to 31%
&gt; - The 33% bracket rises to 36%
&gt; - The 35% bracket rises to 39.6%
 
&gt; Higher taxes on marriage and family.  The ""marriage penalty"" (narrower tax brackets for married couples) will return from the first dollar of income. 

&gt; The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child.  The standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to the single level.  The dependent care and adoption tax credits will be cut.
 
&gt; The return of the Death Tax.  This year, there is no death tax.  For those dying on or after January 1 2011, there is a 55 percent top death tax rate on estates over $1 million.  A person leaving behind two homes and a
 retirement account could easily pass along a death tax bill to their loved ones.
 
&gt; Higher tax rates on savers and investors.  The capital gains tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 20 percent in 2011.  The dividends tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 39.6 percent in 2011.  These rates will rise another 3.8 percent in 2013.
 
&gt; **Second Wave: Obamacare**
 
&gt; There are over twenty new or higher taxes in Obamacare.  Several will first  go into effect on January 1, 2011.  They include:
 
&gt; The ""Medicine Cabinet Tax""  Thanks to Obamacare, Americans will no longer be able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin).
 
&gt; The ""Special Needs Kids Tax""  This provision of Obamacare imposes a cap on flexible spending accounts (FSAs) of $2500 (Currently, there is no federal government limit).  There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children.

&gt; There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United States , and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education. Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs children in
Washington , D.C. ( National Child Research Center ) can easily exceed $14,000 per year.  Under tax rules, FSA dollars can be used to pay for this type of special needs education.
 
&gt; The HSA Withdrawal Tax Hike.  This provision of Obamacare increases the additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.
 
&gt; **Third Wave: The Alternative Minimum Tax and Employer Tax Hikes**
 
&gt; When Americans prepare to file their tax returns in January of 2011, they'll be in for a nasty surprise-the AMT won't be held harmless, and many tax relief provisions will have expired.  The major items include:
 
&gt; The AMT will ensnare over 28 million families, up from 4 million last year. According to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center , Congress' failure to index the AMT will lead to an explosion of AMT taxpaying families-rising from 4 million last year to 28.5 million.  These families will have to calculate their tax burdens twice, and pay taxes at the higher level.  The AMT was created in 1969 to ensnare a handful of taxpayers.
 
&gt; Small business expensing will be slashed and 50% expensing will disappear. Small businesses can normally expense (rather than slowly-deduct, or ""depreciate"") equipment purchases up to $250,000.  This will be cut all the way down to $25,000.  Larger businesses can expense half of their purchases
 of equipment.  In January of 2011, all of it will have to be ""depreciated.""
 
&gt; Taxes will be raised on all types of businesses.  There are literally scores of tax hikes on business that will take place.  The biggest is the loss of the ""research and experimentation tax credit,"" but there are many, many others.  Combining high marginal tax rates with the loss of this tax relief will cost jobs.

&gt; Tax Benefits for Education and Teaching Reduced.  The deduction for tuition and fees will not be available.  Tax credits for education will be limited. Teachers will no longer be able to deduct classroom expenses.  Covered Education Savings Accounts will be cut.  Employer-provided educational assistance is curtailed.  The student loan interest deduction will be disallowed for hundreds of thousands of families.
 
&gt; Charitable Contributions from IRAs no longer allowed.  Under current law, a retired person with an IRA can contribute up to $100,000 per year directly to a charity from their IRA.  This contribution also counts toward an annual ""required minimum distribution.""  This ability will no longer be there.

&gt; Now your insurance is INCOME on your W2's......
  
&gt; One of the surprises we'll find come next year, is what follows - - a little ""surprise"" that 99% of us had no idea was included in the  ""new and improved"" healthcare legislation . . . the dupes, er, dopes, who backed this administration will be astonished!
 
&gt; Starting in 2011, (next year folks), your W-2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or governmental body of some sort.  If you're retired?  So what; your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get.
 
&gt; You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen.  Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or $20,000 additional gross does to your tax debt.  That's what you'll pay next year.  For many, it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's even worse.
 
&gt; This is how the government is going to buy insurance for the15% that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases.

Whenever is that touted?
Why would anyone want a parabolic move to the upside in gov't debt?  NOBODY!  Except the HFT crowd, I can't think of any other ""stakeholder"" that benefits.  Oh, sure........the banks make money on their portfolio.........So the fuck what?  Capital markets are the only game going!  And financial advisors are making a fucking killing telling people to sell their stocks and buy bonds.  Welcome to Japan motherfuckers! So, the baby boomers, the people with capital in this country, will benefit the most (or should I say, suffer the least - think of that on a purchasing power perspective) from an L shaped recovery that could take as long it takes for them to die.  Will that be the only way we restructure?  Of course it is.  When you do that way, you go through the tax code.  
But, I digress............My main point is you NEVER hear for outrageous prices for gov't debt.  And, why the HELL NOW!  It makes no sense.  And in these situations...........you do NOT FUCK with shit that has no basis in reason - except that every single bank in America is trying to front-run the Federal Reserve.  Thats why the rate doesn't fucking matter.  As long as they can sell them to the fed at a higher price who the fuck cares!  And they most certainly can.  That's why the fed should just end it and bid bats shit crazy for debt.  That's what scares me about gold.  How the fuck is debt AND gold catchin bids?  Its a hedge. Think of the leverage that Lehman had when it went down.  Factor that up one and you got the amount of gold backing debt.  Its probably less.  Still, with that much deeper market.........bonds are rippin.    
The banks gig is up.  The rally in bonds is all they have left.  Christ almighty............how levered are the U.S. debt positions?  
I guess Tiny Krugs would argue.........apparently, not enough.

The second model is community based.  Countless individuals will volunteer their time and create their ""work"" for fun.  No oversight.  

Any sober economist 15 years ago would have scoffed at the absurdity of questioning which model would be more successful.

politics,The tax timebomb,"OP note: This is a PARTIAL listing due to space reasons.

In just six months, the crippled economy is going to get kneecapped by waves of new taxes.

In 2001 and 2003, Congress enacted tax cuts for investors, small business owners, and families. These will all expire on January 1, 2011.

Personal income tax rates will rise. The top income tax rate will rise from 35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which two-thirds of small business profits are taxed).

The ""marriage penalty"" (narrower tax brackets for married couples) will return from the first dollar of income.

The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child.

The standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to the single level.

The dependent care and adoption tax credits will be cut.

The return of the Death Tax.

Higher tax rates on savers and investors - the capital gains tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 20 percent in 2011.

The dividends tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 39.6 percent in 2011. These rates will also rise another 3.8 percent in 2013.

When you and I prepare to file their tax returns in January of 2011, we'll be in for a nasty surprise-the AMT won't be held harmless, and many tax relief provisions will have expired.

The AMT will ensnare over *28 million* families, *up from 4 million last year*. According to the Tax Policy Center, Congress' failure to index the AMT will lead to an explosion of AMT taxpaying families-rising from 4 million last year to 28.5 million. These families will have to calculate their tax burdens twice, and pay taxes at the higher level. 

Small business expensing will be slashed and 50% expensing will disappear. Small businesses can normally expense (rather than slowly-deduct, or ""depreciate"") equipment purchases up to $250,000.

This will be cut all the way down to $25,000. Larger businesses can currently expense half of their purchases of equipment. In January of 2011, ALL of it will have to be ""depreciated"".

Also - there are over *twenty* new or higher taxes in Obamacare alone. Several will first go into effect on January 1, 2011. They include:

The ""Medicine Cabinet Tax""

Americans will no longer be able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin).

The ""Special Needs Kids Tax""

This provision imposes a cap on flexible spending accounts (FSAs) of $2500 (right now there is no federal government limit). There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children. Many use FSAs to pay for special needs education. 

The ""HSA"" (""Health Savings Account"") Withdrawal Tax Hike.

This will jack up the additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.",finance,2010-08-27,-0.1304167897812967

However, there doesn't seem to be such phenomenon in the US. between states even though there is a federal and a state government.

Obviously it has nothing to do with size or geographical factors since US is bigger than the whole euro-zone.

Here's his email:


In just four months, on January 1, 2011, the largest tax hikes in the history of America will take effect.

They will hit families and small businesses in three great waves.

On January 1, 2011, here's what happens... (read it to the end, so you see all three waves)...


     
First Wave:


Expiration of 2001 and 2003 Tax Relief

In 2001 and 2003, the GOP Congress enacted several tax cuts for investors, small business owners, and families.

These will all expire on January 1, 2011.



Personal income tax rates will rise. 

The top income tax rate will rise from 35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which two-thirds of small business profits are taxed).  
     
The lowest rate will rise from 10 to 15 percent.  
     
All the rates in between will also rise.  
     

Itemized deductions and personal exemptions will again phase out, which has the same mathematical effect as higher marginal tax rates.  


The full list of marginal rate hikes is below:

The 10% bracket rises to an expanded 15%
The 25% bracket rises to 28%
The 28% bracket rises to 31%
The 33% bracket rises to 36%
The 35% bracket rises to 39.6%


 
Higher taxes on marriage and family.  

The ""marriage penalty"" (narrower tax brackets for married couples) will return from the first dollar of income.  


The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child.  


The standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to the single level.  


The dependent care and adoption tax credits will be cut.


The return of the Death Tax.

This year only, there is no death tax.  (It's a quirk!) For those dying on or after January 1, 2011, there is a 55 percent
top death tax rate on estates over $1 million.  A person leaving behind two homes, a business, a retirement account, could easily pass along a death tax bill to their loved ones.  Think of the farmers who don't make much money, but their land, which they purchased years ago with after-tax dollars, is now worth a lot of money.  Their children will have to sell the farm, which may be their livelihood, just to pay the estate tax if they don't have the cash sitting around to pay the tax.  Think about your own family's assets.  Maybe your family owns real estate, or a business that doesn't make much money, but the building and equipment are worth $1 million.  Upon their death, you can inherit the $1 million business tax free, but if they own a home, stock, cash worth $500K on top of the $1 million business, then you will owe the government $275,000 cash! That's 55% of the value of the assets over $1 million!  Do you have that kind of cash sitting around waiting to pay the estate tax?



Higher tax rates on savers and investors.

The capital gains tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 20 percent in 2011.  

The dividends tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 39.6 percent in 2011.  

These rates will rise another 3.8 percent in 2013.



Second Wave:

Obamacare


There are over twenty new or higher taxes in Obamacare. Several will first go into effect on January 1, 2011.  They include:



The ""Medicine Cabinet Tax""

Thanks to Obamacare, Americans will no longer be able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin).


The ""Special Needs Kids Tax""

This provision of Obamacare imposes a cap on flexible spending accounts (FSAs) of $2500 (Currently, there is no federal government limit). There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children.  

There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United States , and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education.

Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs children in Washington , D.C. ( National Child Research Center ) can easily exceed $14,000 per year.

Under tax rules, FSA dollars can not be used to pay for this type of special needs education.


The HSA (Health Savings Account) Withdrawal Tax Hike.

This provision of Obamacare increases the additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAs and other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.




Third Wave:

The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and Employer Tax Hikes

When Americans prepare to file their tax returns in January of 2011, they'll be in for a nasty surprise-the AMT won't be held harmless, and many tax relief provisions will have expired.

The major items include:


The AMT will ensnare over 28 million families, up from 4 million last year.

According to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center , Congress' failure to index the AMT will lead to an explosion of AMT taxpaying families-rising from 4 million last year to 28.5 million.  These families will have to calculate their tax burdens twice, and pay taxes at the higher level.  The AMT was created in 1969 to ensnare a handful of taxpayers.


Small business expensing will be slashed and 50% expensing will disappear.

Small businesses can normally expense (rather than slowly-deduct, or ""depreciate"") equipment purchases up to $250,000.  

This will be cut all the way down to $25,000.  Larger businesses can currently expense half of their purchases of equipment.  

In January of 2011, all of it will have to be ""depreciated.""


Taxes will be raised on all types of businesses.

There are literally scores of tax hikes on business that will take place.  The biggest is the loss of the ""research and experimentation tax credit,"" but there are many, many others. Combining high marginal tax rates with the loss of this tax relief will cost jobs.


Tax Benefits for Education and Teaching Reduced.

The deduction for tuition and fees will not be available. 

Tax credits for education will be limited.  

Teachers will no longer be able to deduct classroom expenses. 

Coverdell Education Savings Accounts will be cut. 

Employer-provided educational assistance is curtailed.  

The student loan interest deduction will be disallowed for hundreds of thousands of families.


Charitable Contributions from IRAs no longer allowed.

Under current law, a retired person with an IRA can contribute up to $100,000 per year directly to a charity from their IRA.  

This contribution also counts toward an annual ""required minimum distribution.""  This ability will no longer be there.

And worse yet?


Now, your insurance will be INCOME on your W2's!

One of the surprises we'll find come next year, is what follows - - a little ""surprise"" that 99% of us had no idea was included in the ""new and improved"" healthcare legislation . . . the dupes, er, dopes, who backed this administration will be astonished!

Starting in 2011, (next year folks), your W-2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or governmental body of some sort.  

If you're retired?  So what... your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get.

You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen.  Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or $20,000 additional gross does to your tax debt.  That's what you'll pay next year.  

For many, it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's even worse.



This is how the government is going to buy insurance for the15% that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases.

Not believing this???  Here is a research of the summaries.....

On page 25 of 29: TITLE IX REVENUE PROVISIONS- SUBTITLE A: REVENUE OFFSET PROVISIONS-(sec. 9001,
as modified by sec. 10901) Sec.9002  ""requires employers to include in the W-2 form of each employee the aggregate cost of applicable employer sponsored group health coverage that is excludable from the employees gross income.""

politics,Fuck banks ...,"Seriously, we all knew this was going to happen when the government tried to regulate their already snake-like behavior ... but Banks are taking what we've all come to expect and turning it against us.

Today I deposited a check which typically credits my bank account, allowing me to debit funds from that balance provided that I do the transfer as a ""credit transaction"" rather than a ""debit transaction"". Then using what little cash I had to go to the next town over I was going to buy something and when I tried to buy it using a credit transaction my debit card was declined. This wasn't only humiliating and a complete waste of my time ... but I was expecting it.

After this federal legislation went through banks have been pulling these kinds of tricks. Had I agreed to enable their new ""overdraft protection"" which incurs a monthly fee the transaction might have gone through but not only do the terms state that they can deny a transaction they also state that I can incur a $34 overdraft fee. So basically all I'd be paying for is the added risk of getting my card declined at a restaurant and having to talk to the police after I couldn't pay for my meal OR everything appearing to have gone smoothly only to find out that $15 plate of curried vegetables actually cost me $50. It's asinine ...

So what do we do? I'm sick of dealing with banks, just sick of it. I have bills that I'm literally not allowed to pay with cash. Doesn't the law explicitly state that my currency is good for something? Shouldn't making me pay my rent with a check or money order and refusing my cash be illegal? I know what places charge to do money orders and it's a total ball-kick. The public should have the right to live a normal life without being lashed down to some blood-sucking financial institution just to pay their freaking rent.

Am I missing something here? Is it just me or has this country exchanged ""common courtesy"" for ""a hyper-inflated sense of entitlement"" virtually overnight. I miss common courtesy ...

And seriously, it's the freaking information age for christ sake. Isn't this ""series of tubes"" supposed to be able to clear my damn check in a fraction of a second? No wonder the banks need bailing out all the time; it's like someone has to send someone else an Excel spreadsheet just for me to get my damn money. I'm sick of it.

I just knew that Reddit might respond with something besides another ""form letter"" noting my complaints and explaining to me that I should just pay for overdraft protection for the privilege of being fined for using my own funds.

Fuck banks ...

Edit: My bank charges $20 (domestic), $40 (foreign) to wire funds using their web site or $25 (domestic), $45 (foreign) to wire fund from one of their branch locations. Aka: wiring funds = serious ball-kick.

They are the less extreme roots of the policies and arguments we see from the Republican Party, talk-radio, and FOX News. These are the ones I have noticed (large themes in bullets, explanation following when needed:)

* Small Government: Federal gov. should defer to States' Rights, limited budget 

* Anti-socialist: egalitarianism is impossible, destroys incentive for innovation/success, equality of opportunity not equality of outcome, welfare state siphons money from hard-working americans

* Trickle-down Economics: pro-Big Business, tax cuts for the rich

* Strong Military 

* A good vs. evil, black and white worldview: what's right is right, what's wrong is wrong, etc

* Personal Responsibility: especially in context of finances, social class, success

* Importance of Faith, Morality: almost exclusively Christian values, or ""small town""

Another idea I'd like to see discussed-
* Democrats fund entitlement programs to ensure the votes of the poor with no intent of actually helping anyone

Please comment with any themes I missed.

Let's take a critical eye to the conservative hivemind; defend the valid ideals, critique the invalid/disproven ones, point out successes AND hypocrisies/inconsistancies. Keep it reasonable, and *cite sources whenever possible*

If this goes well, we'll tackle the liberal hivemind next :-) I'm counting on you guys. If all I get is trolls and downvotes, I might cry.

politics,Would you vote for me for president?,"I think I could gain some momentum for being the first anonymous presidential candidate, and this is a purely internet run campaign to see how far I can get.  I hope this doesn't fall flat, but I know it probably won't amount to much.  No matter how much support I end up getting, I probably don't intend to run for president because let's face it, it would never happen.  However if I get a little support, I'd be willing to put that to use for another candidate.

I think the '12 election could be crucial.  Either we continue to support the lesser of two evils, or we demand actual change.  This is an amazing opportunity for a third party to gain real support because many people are fed up with both the Democrats and Republicans.

Here are my ideas:

* Reduce military spending by an order of magnitude.  This could be achieved by eliminating the hundreds of foreign military bases, reducing the number of active soldiers because so many soldiers aren't needed for defense (various methods such as giving soldiers a chance to voluntarily leave), drastically reducing the money spent on military production while maintaining the money spent on military research (minus weapons of mass destruction), eliminating military advertising, etc.

* Single payer health care.  I like to think that with enough funds diverted from the military that we could have the far and away best health care system in the world.  doctors would probably love single payer+free college.  

* All education free (even trade schools and private universities).  Possibly start programs to raise graduation rates at all levels.  Increase teacher's wages to start attracting better minds (50% or so increase for k-12 and public university teachers).  

As you can tell, I don't think Socialism is a dirty word, but I still want a primarily Capitalistic economy.

* Declare a foreign policy that is simple: no foreign meddling (even covert stuff).  This would hopefully open up relations with Cuba, Venezuela, North Korea, etc.  I'd be willing to bet that this would reduce terrorism as well.

* I am an open and honest atheist who strongly believes in the first amendment.

* Raise minimum wage to ~$10 an hour, but simultaneously and proportionally raise taxes.  This would be designed to allow the lower class to make the same net amount of money, except raise the poor's standard of living because health care and college are paid for.  This is a ploy to tax corporations basically (sorry Conde), so maybe we could give subsidies to small business who have fewer than 30 workers.  Anyone who is considered a dependent would still have the $7.25 minimum (not sure on this and it would need work to prevent loopholes).

* Create a new tax class that will affect millionaires.  It is a progressive tax, so the first $999,999 will still be taxed the same rate.  I don't feel comfortable making up a % off the top of my head here, so I'm all ears.

* End corporate person hood.  This is an area that I know very little about, but it seems to just make sense.  If someone writes a good summary for or against corporate person hood, I'll paste it here.

* I'd run a fully transparent government that is run much more candidly.  Not just transparency, but no obfuscating the truth.

* I'm in favor of exploring ways to encourage something different to the current two party system.

* I'd make a Department of Science, and I would defer to them on most science issues.  I'd also like to increase scientific literacy and increase funding in research especially on the physical sciences.  I'd merge the Department of Homeland Security with the Department of Defense (seems redundant).  This is consistent with my trying not necessarily to reduce government for the sake of reducing, but to make it more efficient.

* Environmental awareness and global warming would be a good issue to frame.  I'd really like to heed the scientific consensus and do something about global warming and even encourage a new international pact that requires action instead of just suggesting it. 

* I would amend the constitution for animal rights.  I am not a vegetarian, but I'd like to end stuff like deplorable factory farming and animal suffering that could easily be stopped.  This would be agreeable to everyone who is not a psychopath, literally.

* Make a plan to decelerate the national deficit and set tangible and realistic goals to hypothetically eliminate it (even if it's 100 years from now).  This hopefully could be reconciled with all of the other ideas.

* I think that public education needs an overhaul, and I'd like to hear what you think.

* Abolish state sponsored lottery.

* Drug decriminalization for certain drugs and possibly legalization as well, and I'd defer to the experts on this.

* I'm willing to work with people on my policy, and I'd be willing to flip flop on issues if I think that I'm wrong (admitting you are wrong is good).  I'd also like to hear suggestions on other issues.

I voted for Ralph Nader in '08, and I am a supporter of his.  I like the way Ron Paul runs his politics, but I don't know if I'd ever vote for him.  I don't know who I'll support in '12, but I doubt it'll be Obama or the Republican candidate.

Economics,This question is never answered around here: What happens when interest rates are raised (in this economy)?,"I'm sure that we're all quite aware of the constant battle between New-Keynesian &amp; Austrian 'economists' on here. Frankly, it speaks volumes for the failures of both schools of thought, and leaves the objective individual with a deep impression of just where each set of arguments fail.

You New-Keynesians have made your point about the lack of mathematics in Austrian economics, and I think that all rhetoric aside, there is something to be said about it.--But I do not see one debate being answered honestly by the New-Keynesians: What in the world will happen to prices when interest rates are raised?

It seems that there is a disconnect between those who deal with the real business world, and those who are isolated to academia. You 'academics' always insist that money printing and security purchasing can go on forever. You 'real-world' men seem hell bent on prophesying complete collapse. 

It troubles me that these two very useful schools of thought must exist in such extremes. Can we perhaps focus on finding a relationship between interest rates and the business cycle? I, even after abandoning Austrian economics, cannot convince myself that there is no relationship. Paul Volcker's term at the Federal Reserve seems to almost prove outright that there must be a link. I think that he averted serious disaster, and that the lessons of his term have never really been learned by anyone in a position to do anything. Volckers term aside, our latest lesson in low-interest rates and their consequences seems to have been the housing collapse and the following credit contraction. How long can the New-Keynesians honestly ignore this relationship?

The only thing that I want to add is that the Austrians predictions of hyperinflation might only be seen when such radical monetary policy is not being imposed on the world economy. The government hasn't even let _housing_ or the _auto industry_ walk on their own feet yet. I  can only say that Krugman indeed might have his day in the sun, but my god, isnt it premature to call victory already?

politics,Would you vote for a president who promised to do the following?,"Because Harry Browne did in 2000, and no candidate since has been bold enough to repeat them...

On that first day in office, by executive order I would:

* Pardon everyone who had been convicted on a federal, non-violent drug charge, order their immediate release, reunite them with their families, and restore all their civil rights. (Anyone convicted of using violence against someone else in a drug case would not qualify as ""non-violent."")

* I would pardon everyone who had been convicted on any federal gun-control charge, tax-evasion charge, or any other victimless crime, order their immediate release, and restore all their civil rights.

* I would empty the prisons of those who haven't harmed anyone else and make room for the violent criminals who are currently getting out on plea bargains and early release.

Following the issuance of the pardons:

* I would announce a policy to penalize, dismiss, or even prosecute any federal employee who violated the Bill of Rights by treating you as guilty until proven innocent, by searching or seizing your property without due process of law, by treating you as a servant, or in any other way violating your rights as a sovereign American citizen.

* I would immediately order that no federal asset forfeiture could occur unless the property's owner had been convicted by full due process.

* I would initiate steps to make restitution to anyone whose property had been impounded, frozen, or seized by the federal government without a legal conviction. (Over 80 percent of such seizures occur when no one has even been charged with a crime.)

* I would immediately remove all American troops from foreign soil. Europe and Asia can pay for their own defense, and they can risk their own lives in their eternal squabbles. This would save billions of dollars a year in taxes, but -- more important -- it would make sure your sons and daughters never fight or die in someone else's war.

* I would order everyone in the executive branch to stop harassing smokers, tobacco companies, successful computer companies, gun owners, gun manufacturers, alternative medicine suppliers, religious groups (whether respected or labeled as ""cults""), investment companies, health-care providers, businessmen, or anyone else who's conducting his affairs peaceably.

* I would end federal affirmative action, federal quotas, set-asides, preferential treatments, and other discriminatory practices of the federal government. Any previous president could have done this with a stroke of the pen. Do you wonder why none of them did?

**And then I would break for lunch.**

* After lunch, I would begin the process of removing from the Federal Register the thousands and thousands of regulations and executive orders inserted there by previous presidents. In most cases these regulations give federal employees powers for which there is no constitutional authority.

* I would call Office Depot and order a carload of pens -- to use to veto congressional bills that violate the Constitution or that spend more money than necessary for the constitutional functions of government.

* I would send to Congress a budget that immediately cuts federal spending in half -- on its way to reducing the government to no larger than its constitutional size.

* Congress would undoubtedly pass a larger budget and expect me to sign it. I wouldn't. I'd veto it.

Would Congress override my veto?

Maybe it would and maybe it wouldn't.

Even if Congress succeeded in passing bills over my veto, the battle finally would be joined. We finally would have something we haven't had in my lifetime -- a president standing up to Congress.

At long last, there would be two sides arguing in Washington -- one to increase government and one to cut it sharply -- instead of the current trivial debate over whether government should grow 5 percent a year or ""only"" 3 percent.

No president in the past several decades has had the will, the determination, the courage to ""just say no"" to Congress.

No president in the past several decades has even tried to reduce the size of government. Any president who wanted to do so could have managed it -- even in the face of a hostile Congress.

No president since the 1950s has proposed a single budget that would reduce the size of the federal government. And when Congress has come back with even larger budgets, no president has vetoed them.

Every president who claimed to be against big government has had that veto at his disposal, but none thought enough of your freedom to use it.

As president, I would -- for the first time -- use that office on your behalf. I would say no to Congress. Whatever new program it wanted to spend money on, I would veto. Whatever new tax it wanted to impose, I would veto. Whatever new intrusion it wanted to make in your life, I would veto.

No deals. No excuses. No apologies. No regrets.

But I would do more than just defend what little freedom you have left today. I would go on the offensive. **I wouldn't rest until the income tax was repealed**, the federal government was so small you wouldn't worry about who was elected president, and you had control over your own money, your own freedom, your own life.

**And when we achieved this, we'd have a celebration. Do you remember the German youths who tore down the Berlin Wall and sold pieces of it to us?**

**Well, we would tear down the IRS building and sell the pieces -- and use the proceeds to help IRS agents find honest work. **",finance,2010-09-06,-0.0968466509251048

politics,Some points about voting third party that everyone in /r/politics should be familiar with.,"&gt; *I'm fed up with this two party duopoly and I'm voting third party this election!!*

Do you know what your district demographics are? Voting third party is feasible in an already-liberal area, but in a swing area this may not be a good idea.

&gt; *Why? We need to send a message to the democrats that we're not taking their BS anymore.*

Because of our plurality voting system. Consider this: depending on the way in which the votes are split, it's usually advantageous to move to the position with the smallest gap from theirs. Example: in an already-liberal area where the green party gets 20% of the vote and the republicans get 10%, it's advantageous to move to the green side. But if the republicans get 51% and the greens get 1%, being green may hurt your cause more than help.

&gt; *That's selling out. You should vote for someone who best represents your views.*

When the person has a chance of getting those views actualized, yes. If you are voting for someone who you know represents your views well but only has 0.1% of the vote then you might as well write a letter to congress saying ""here are my views, now take them seriously."" At that point it's just an intellectual exercise and you're doing a real disservice to your ideas. The best way to get your views put into action is to find the person who matches most closely with your views among those who have a reasonable chance at getting elected. This is very possible if you start at the local level, and can even be done up to the senate level if you work hard enough.

&gt; *This lesser-of-two-evils reasoning isn't helping our democracy.*

Actually, the [plurality system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plurality_voting_system) isn't helping our democracy. Any plurality system necessitates lesser-of-two-evils voting styles. There's a law in Political Science named [Duverger's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) that describes this phenomenon.

&gt; *So then why can so many countries have working third parties?*

They use a system of proportional representation, where the percentage of seats won is the percentage of seats allocated to that party.

&gt; *But what about the UK? Don't they have a third-party system?*

redditor ""vintermann"" has a great answer to this question: constituency sizes are smaller. Because of the way party machines work, you can usually have some kind of third-party representation with a small constituency, which is why *some* Greens have been able to get elected. In the US, the senate and presidency have enormous constituency sizes, which makes a third-party victory practically impossible at that level. (he gives more reasons, but I think this is the most pressing one.)

&gt; *Then how can people like Bernie Sanders get elected?*

As a rule, if the area is liberal enough, a green or libertarian might be viable. Or, if an area is conservative enough, the alternative might happen: a third-party ultraconservative might be viable.  If it's a swing area like most places, it's very unlikely.

But an independent victory is not a third-party victory. Remember that Sanders has to caucus with the democrats.

&gt; *So why can't we have proportional representation?*

Rational-self interest applied to groups, not to mention that [American conservatives hate the idea of proportional representation.](http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/jun/06/00026/) There's an article about how [PR is very difficult to obtain in the US.](http://rangevoting.org/PropRep.html) 

&gt; *What the hell. That's the opposite of helping me. So then what can we do?*

Support candidates at the local level. The DailyKos's [Orange to Blue](http://www.actblue.com/page/orangetoblue) campaign was all about electing real progressives from the ground-up. The unfortunate reality is that the US is going to be a duopoly for a very long time because of [Duverger's law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duverger%27s_law) and the difficulty of changing our voting system; supporting local candidates is the best way to make the best of our flawed US system.

&gt; *Fuck you and your status quo bullshit.*

If you work at the local level to elect candidates who best represent you, that is the opposite of voting for the status quo.

&gt; *I'm still not changing my views.*

If you're not reasonable enough to be open for critical discussion about your voting decision then you're doing a disservice to the democratic ideals you're trying to uphold.",technology,2010-09-07,-0.0205710985390982

Economics,In fact for a capitalistic economy like the USA to work you must always make sure the huge majority of the population has a huge amount of money in their hands. ... the population not having cash in hand to spend is like having a democracy where no one gets to vote. The cash is their vote.,"Money isn't a zero sum game. Neither is wealth and there is not a limited supply of money because money is a printed (now also computer generated) exchange medium.

Money distributed to the population through high minimum wages and social giveaways creates a middle class which spurs consumption which makes profits for manufacturing in a circular process. You get profits and manufacturing by ensuring money remains in circulation throughout the population.

When money is distributed throughout the population it creates dynamic capitalism and profits. When money is locked up among a small percentage of the population it makes the economy stagnate.

Tomorrow the USA could expand it 's economy dramatically by literally giving $5000 in printed money to every individual.

Overnight demand would increase (especially if import quotas were in place) and jobs would be created from manufacturing demand. Wealth would increase as would living standards because goods will be produced immediately that would not be produced otherwise and those goods would increase the living standards of the nation - hence wealth would be increased.

All you are doing is restarting a broken economic exchange medium. money is not wealth. It has no intrinsic value. it is simply the populations exchange medium. it doesn't do what it is supposed to do if it isn't in the populations hands.

and inflation doesn't matter as long as the money is being circulated back into the population's hands faster than it inflates.

The fallacy today is people think we must create jobs before circulating money. That comes from a misunderstanding of the connection between money and work. Money is ONLY an exchange medium - not a moral reward for work. Relative wealth advancement is the reward for work by an individual and that happens regardless of the nature of money because wealth advancement is an increase in leisure, living standards, possessions etc all of which again are completely independent of money (If you own your home with no debt and payments and have a garden you have no need for money but have wealth. you no longer need the exchange medium to transact with others because you have achieved self sufficient wealth).

Think about it.

Why do people talk about creating jobs? to put MONEY in those job holder's pockets. YOU DON'T NEED THE JOBS FIRST TO DO THAT. Inflation isn't a problem and actually helps the us relative to other countries.

The reason deciders are against inflation is that inflation decreases the relative wealth of those who already have it compared to those contributing to the economy now (who are earning in higher dollars due to inflation).

It isn't a radical notion to simply give people money. In fact that is exactly why the European economies are rebounding so much faster than the USA. They literally give people money every month whether they work or not and they make sure when they work they make a LOT of money so they have enough each month to spend on things other than food and shelter. their system ensure money always stays in circulation (even when there are no ""jobs"") and the population always has a means to express their demand for new goods through purchasing so manufacturing does not stagnant even in times of recession. This lets them reallocate manufacturing quickly and keep the economy going away from failed enterprises and bubbles like housing and on to new things quickly.

And don't equate giving money to people with socialism because it is monetary policy not socialism. In fact it is the heart of capitalism to give people money which is after all only government issued script to lubricate a capitalist market. Saying you are for capitalism but not doing things to ensure the circulation of capital into the hands of the people is like saying you love cats and you want to kill them all to protect the one you own. If you believe in capitalism you must make sure capital always is int he hands of the population so the market can work to adjust itself to their demands. if you don't do that your only choices are to have a government decide what the people want more of which is communism not capitalism or socialism.

in the 1930's one of the huge reasons we got out of the depression (the GNP was back to pre depression levels 2 years BEFORE PEARL HARBOR which the linked article glosses over) was there were multiple ways people were GIVEN MORE MONEY by the government. IT WAS STUFFED IN THEIR HANDS AS FAST AS LEGALLY AND POLITICALLY POSSIBLE. They were given money through new welfare programs. they were given money by a statutory increase in minimum wage. they were given money by increased wages caused by legal rights given to unions to get those wage increases for the same work done before for less money (no increase in productivity). They were given money later in the forties simply for signing on the dotted line and going to war. (those going to war contributed nothing to the wealth of the nation but the SPENDING OF THE MONEY THEY WERE GIVEN prompted capital exchange and goods consumption and production which didn't exist before.

In fact soldiers are TAKEN OUT OF THE ECONOMY not put into it and are the perfect valid proof of this concept of GIVING money to the population regardless of their contribution to the economy.

Giving money to soldiers is literally like locking them in a prison where they cannot contribute to manufacturing and giving them money which their relatives spend. Soldier's wages boosting an economy back home is the ultimate proof that simply giving people money when they are not contributing to the economy in the form of a production job actually works to stimulate the economy and wealth of a nation.

There is a false religious based concept that in this nation people should not ""get something for nothing"" which unfortunately distorts economic policy.

In fact for a capitalistic economy like the USA to work you must always make sure the huge majority of the population has a huge amount of money in their hands. that' s because in capitalism you have agreed that the best economic determination for a country comes from it's people voting individually to spend on things they not the government decides are good for them and what they want. then the economy produces that. the population not having cash in hand to spend is like having a democracy where no one gets to vote. The cash is their vote. It is important that it is constantly given to them and constantly being spent for it to matter.

the reason the us had such a huge expansion in the past decades was people were given money in the form of easy credit and false valuation of their real estate.

The problem wasn't that they were given that money. After all it created a boom in home building and electronic production and consumption which did increase the living standards of the nation. (the population has bigger homes inside the borders of the nation and more products than they would have if not given that money ten years ago.) The problem was they were given that money based on the valuation of only real estate which caused it to be distorted in value compared to other things in the economy creating a bubble.

The other problem was interest rates weren't controlled which means debts eventually reached a choking point so the cost of the debt is higher than the growth of the wealth of the nation so the money circulation by the population stops. (this was simply  a matter of the elimination fo the usury laws in the 1980's which allowed this to happen and could be corrected by their reinstatement just as easily.)

We need to grant debt free Money to people. It should be done as welfare or workfare or fake soldier enlistment as the article writer proposes. It doesn't matter.

We just need to stuff money in the consumers hands as fast as possible and tomorrow the economy will be off and running again and new jobs will be created base don what the people buy.


Edit: one last thing. It's important for all you conservative capitalists doubting the truth of this to realize the government already gives free money away in huge amounts to a segment of our society - the Federal reserve and bankers through fractional lending. The problem is the government just prints money and is giving it to the very people (the bankers and federal reserve) who won't spur consumer demand because they don't give it to consumer who don't have it to spend now.

If the government simply stopped giving the same amounts to bankers and the federal reserve and simply shifted it directly to consumers inflation effect would be the same yet the economy would be immediately stimulated right out of the depression.

By the way none of this is new.

This has been figured out over and over by westernized banking economic cultures and it always works. The Dutch did it after their famous tulip speculation depression, Germany did it to get out of their depression and briefly be the strongest nation in the world in the 30's. Eurpoe has universally done it since WW2 to become the strongest economy in the world (The EU is bigger than the US economy) and America did it in the 30's and we should do it again.

Government script not in the hands of its citizens is not doing what it is printed and exists for  - being an means of exchange.

Give it away!
Tomorrow!

Only the bankers who make a living giving you the government money for a fee who aren't doing their jobs now will be detrimently affected.

politics,An Idea: Improve unemployment via the Tea Party's pseudo patriotism.,"Alt account for obvious reasons which are to follow.

Since this is Reddit, I know many of you are in the IT field or will be once school is complete. We all know the IT job market is brutal at the moment and I've been trying to figure out what to make of the future.

Quick background: I was working for an amazing US based IT company that was contracted by a very well known software giant based in the Seattle area. The large company decided to drop any vendors that were US based and thus my first foray into the woes of outsourcing began. I was picked up by the overseas company that was awarded the previously awesome US IT company’s contract. It was then I realized how the management at giant company are completely out of touch with reality.

My job consisted of essentially mitigating incidents within the entire organizations internal and major revenue external network structure. This is kind of important and requires a great deal of due diligence and common sense; both which are gone with the outflux of key personnel and myself preoccupied with training the extremely overstaffed newbie’s. The international company in question is based in India and we all know they are not known for quality, dependability and basic understanding of troubleshooting (I tried to word this differently but after training dozens of employees I can attest that even if I stapled the steps for a simple troubleshooting issue on their chest, I would still have to explain it over and over).

Rant over. Now onto the topic of this post..

It's obvious that the concern for these large IT firms is hitting the numbers and not about quality or patriotism. To me what they did and are doing is treasonous and not a single fuck is given to the US IT worker as long as the managers have a job. How do you change something like this?

I purpose that company image is the second most valued asset these companies have. If they were to be labeled as unpatriotic, foreign controlled and a catalyst for American job loss I would hedge my bets these companies would quickly rethink their policies. Who else better to spread fear, panic, and distrust of foreign entities than the Tea Party?

Using this extremist/racist group doesn’t sit well morally for me as it perpetuates racism of other cultures but they seem to have the ear of many high profile people, especially MSM. The bottom line is a drastic action needs to take place and I think this is the most feasible option for actual results. In other words, ""The enemy of my enemy is my friend"".

I understand that forcing companies to ban outsourcing may seem almost unconstitutional, but what good is the constitution if we chop off the driving force of progress (technology) and become a husk of our former selves? I understand that people are buying less and therefore companies need to use cheaper products and labor, but it’s going to harm the company tenfold in the end and it perpetuates the vicious cycle of the poor becoming poorer and the rich becoming richer.

**TLDR:** They took our jerbs, we use the Tea Party to pressure companies to use US workers and stop outsourcing by exposing these corporations for what they really are.

Its immune from any kind of Profit/Loss or Free Market mechanism. The military funded by redistributing the wealth of taxpayers to the military industrial complex by force of federal law. And – It’s owned &amp; operated, exclusively by the government. 

Everything is socialized in the military. Everyone gets all kinds of government funded entitlements and benefits like medical care, food, clothing, shelter, day care, transportation, pensions, and even access to technical training and higher education (G.I. Bill.) 

The military is almost like a parallel, socialist state or society that even has its set of laws regarding the limitation personal freedoms and its own justice and prison system.

The military is easily the most socialist institution we have. I don’t see how it could be any more obvious.

I’ve had this conversation a few times and the counter argument typically works like one of these:

A) ""The Military = Good"" and ""Socialism = Bad"" 
Therefore, the military isn't a socialist institution.

B) We ""need"" the military but we don't ""need"" [Whatever government funded program] that is wasting the taxpayers money on the poor.
Therefore, the military isn't a socialist institution.

Maintaining a military is a requirement for the security of our nation, and we need to take care of our troops, etc… But that doesn’t change the fact that the military is a gigantic socialist institution.",finance,2010-09-09,-0.0419164618064422

gaming,"/r/gaming, I need a new RTS :)","So I've finally got fed up of C&amp;C 3 and C&amp;C 4 is apparently ass so I'm going to avoid it.  I'm a stickler for RTSs that require a spot of skill and fair play instead of just whoever can click the fastest and rock-paper-scissors.

All the EA C&amp;C games seem to revolve around rushing, spam, bullshit and are balanced like Dawn French and an anorexic sitting on a seesaw together.  C&amp;C 3 in particular was released in 2007 (2008 for Kane's Wrath) and two tanks still struggle to kill one machine gunner?  That's fine, I'll just watch ten rocketeers and one cheap helicopter wipe out my $5000 unique unit in 30s flat even if I provide heavy backup, and don't get me started on the Scrin - what were EA thinking?  They're overpowered and annoying.  I wish Westwood were still around because Red Alert 2 online was sublime, played fairly and neatly balanced in my experience - if you lost, it's because you got outwitted and slowly worn down instead of getting spammed with 10gazlllion of the cheapest infantry within 1 minute of starting.

So, as I say, I'd like some kind of RTS that doesn't feature this nonsense and actually provides a nice, rounded, balanced and skilled experience.  I was wondering about Starcraft 2, but as I've never actually played the original I don't know what to expect.  Do people online play in a similar manner to C&amp;C or is it more skilled and slower paced?

I'm also thinking Company of Heroes because it's really cheap on Steam right now and I enjoyed the demo all that time ago, and I also really enjoyed Rome Total War but I've lost the disc.  I liked it because you started with what you had and finished with what you had; no resource gathering, no spam, no flooding the map with endless cheap units and no cheap tricks to rack up endless easy wins.

Or, I could stick to what I know - is Red Alert 3 laden with bullshit in the same way Tiberium Wars is?  I've only played the demo and have never played online, is it just rushing and spamming with the cheapest unit or is it more accessible and friendly?

Economics,Debunking Dana Milbank's attempt to make Keynes appear uncontroversial and demonize the non-Keynesians,"This is the epitome of a ruling class view of Keynes:

http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/10/AR2010091003754.html

And now I will show why Dana Milbank is an establishment hack:

**Myth #1: The republicans hate Keynes.**

&gt; *""With so much of Keynesian theory universally embraced, Republican denunciation of him has a flat-earth feel to it""*

Truth: Republicans have often implemented Keynesian policy, including George Bush's forgotten early-2008 stimulus and the barrage of bailouts in late 2008. Keynesianism has been the dominant economic ideology by both parties since the 1930s. Also, Keynesian policy, especially in the monetary realm, in response to the 2001-2002 tech-boom downturn set the stage for the larger business cycle downturn in 2008.  See Austrian Business Cycle Theory - low interest rates send false signals regarding the amount of resources that are available to be consumed in projects.  Hence, this causes malinvestment and causes entrepreneurs and consumers to make choices they otherwise wouldn't have.  Even for people who don't like ABCT, you have acknowledge that Keynesianism - and not any type of free-marketism - has been the dominant macroeconomic philosophy in Washington.

**Myth #2: If somebody is for a policy which could be described as ""Keynesian"" (for example: tax cuts in a recession), then they are for Keynesianism.**

&gt; *""Perhaps these Republicans don't realize that some of their tax-cut proposals are as ""Keynesian"" as Obama's program. ""*

Truth:  Simply because a policy exists in the shared Venn Diagram area between Keynesian and free-market, does not mean that implementation of that policy validates the Keynesian view.  Using that logic, it would also validate the free-market view.

**Myth #3:  The monetarists and mathematical-model wielding economists are the only economists opposing Keynes.  There are no others.**

&gt; *""Economists offering alternatives to Keynes devised mathematical models showing how markets would behave efficiently. But those ideas collapsed along with everything else in 2008.""*

Truth: The Austrians exist!  No, seriously. Hayek, Keynes main intellectual adversary, won a Nobel Prize for his explication of business cycle theory.  However, his views were not included in the column.  

Also, this should blow peoples' minds.  Larry Kudlow - monetarist icon - supports the uber-Keynesianism Cash for Clunkers.  Milbank's attempt to portray monetarism and Keynesianism as opposites, *and the only possible macro philosophies*, is simply wrong.  Plus, monetarism and Keynesianism share a mathematical affinity - which Milbank lambasts the Chicago School for, but leaves Keynesianism untouched.  Confusing?  Not when you realize that Milbank isn't a Keynesian, he's just using it.  If he really were concerned about too much math in macro, he'd have to go Austrian or some other heterodox school.

**Myth #4: Keynes is a god.**

&gt;  *""Keynes's place in economics is similarly unassailable""*

&gt;  *""With so much of Keynesian theory universally embraced, denunciation of him has a flat-earth feel to it.""*

Truth: He's just a man.  Saying that Keynesian theory is largely embraced is to ignore the 70s experience of stagflation that refuted it, and it is to ignore that even academia, which leans left, moved away from Keynes in recent years as research emerged and real-world experience (like the 70s, and Japan stimulus failures) made Keynesianism look unattractive.

**Myth #5: If one realizes that downturns are followed by a reduction in demand, then you a Keynesian!**

&gt;  *""The uncertainty of the financial crisis caused a spiral of falling demand, investments and employment -- just as Keynes had said would happen. A sudden rise in savings among anxious consumers accelerated the decline -- the ""paradox of thrift"" that Keynes had warned about.""*

**Truth: No, all economists, even non-Keynesians, realize that a reduction in demand accompanies the recession.  The question is not whether this happens or not, but rather why it happens, along with whether it's a necessary readjustment or something to be fought against.  Keynesians such as Milbank simply assume for no reason that falling demand is a bad thing.  Of course, this is silly, it's the same Keynesians complaining about lack of savings other times.**

**Myth #6: The opponents of Keynesianism are trying to kill people**

&gt; *""There is an alternative to such ""Keynesian experiments,"" however. The government could do nothing, and let the human misery continue. By rejecting the ""Keynesian playbook,"" this is what Republicans are really proposing.""*

We've already gone over the myth that Republicans hate Keynesianism.  They don't, and they never have, and specifically their use of Keynesianism (in monetary realm, especially) in response to the 2001-2002 recession inflated the bubble more and pushed the business cycle down the road.  But if you don't take the hangover now, you'll get it worse later...

As for his claim that republicans are trying to kill people, if that has been their goal historically, it would have to be by embracing Keynesianism rather than fighting against it.  Milbank incorrectly assumes their rhetoric matches their policy.

**Myth #7: If you can cite a couple of ""conservative"" people who like Keynes, then it shows how idiotic non-Keynesians are.**

&gt; *""Writing last year in the New Republic, Richard Posner of the conservative Chicago school of economic thought argued that Keynes's 1936 General Theory ""is the best guide we have to the crisis. . . . Economists may have forgotten The General Theory and moved on, but economics has not outgrown it.""*

&gt; *""Here's what Mankiw wrote about Keynes in November 2008 in the New York Times: ""If you were going to turn to only one economist to understand the problems facing the economy, there is little doubt that the economist would be John Maynard Keynes. Although Keynes died more than a half-century ago, his diagnosis of recessions and depressions remains the foundation of modern macroeconomics.""""*

Truth: Keynesians backing Keynes.  This says nothing.

**Myth #8:  There is a cause-and-effect relationship between rising savings and economic recessions.  Also, the paradox of thrift is obvious.**

&gt;  *""A sudden rise in savings among anxious consumers accelerated the decline -- the ""paradox of thrift"" that Keynes had warned about.""*

Truth: the effect is correlative, not causative.  The reason for the change in peoples' subjective value preferences that causes them to seek increased savings is the real cause of the downturn.  Rising savings are simply an effect.  Milbanks' statement is disingenuous because he doesn't acknowledge that the non-Keynesians will allow that rising savings will *accompany* downturns, but are a symptom, not a cause.  Non-keynesians thus do not want to fight against the rising savings.  It is the antidote.  Milbank portrays the paradox of thrift as uncontroversial because he hides the opposing view.

**Myth #9: Opposing Keynesianism is the same thing as opposing Keynes.**

&gt; *John Maynard Keynes, the GOP's latest whipping boy  [title]*

Truth: Modern Keynesians have deviated from Keynes' ""pragmatism"" and warnings against a central planning state.  Keynes was somewhat alarmed by the implications of his philosophy.

In conclusion, Dana Milbank is a political hack because he bends truths into falsehoods to support his big-government ideology.  I will continue to have this view until Mlibank starts advocating for extending the Bush tax rate cuts for all.  He would have to do that to show that he is the Keynesian true-believer that he poses as.  He's not a true-believer. He's just using Keynes as a political ploy, the same way Obama uses Keynes, and then dumps him the second that his theories get in the way of raising taxes on the high earners.",finance,2010-09-12,-0.0836496663637409

politics,"This is what everyone's predicting will happen in the midterm 2010 election.  If so, my fellow Americans, we're a group of crazy idiots.","Voters are angry that the economy is not better, and joblessness remains high.   A simple [Keynsian analysis](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/05/the-story-of-the-stimulus/) done both by Christine Roemer and, separately, Paul Krugman showed an output gap due to the sudden collapse of the economy to be $2 Trillion dollars.  The federal government is the only insitution capable of addressing such a gap by increased spending.  If one spends money in such a way as to maximize the mulitplier effect (at best: $1.6 of increased output for every $1 borrowed and spent by the Federal Government), then a stimulus spending plan of $1.2 Trillion would make up for it. 

The Republicans would have none of it.  You only get a multiplier of 1.6 by giving money to the unemployed, the poor, the working class and the lower middle class -- and those people don't vote Republican.  The GOP wanted more tax cuts for the rich.  Problem is, the rich's multplier is close to 1 -- they tend to save it, rather than spend it.  And because the GOP votes as a block in the Senate, and they had the votes to filibuster a $1.2 Trillion Spending plan, the Republicans decided to condemn the unemployed to remain unemployed, by blocking it.   The only plan acceptable GOP senators: an $800B plan, and $200B had to be in tax breaks for the rich. So, really, only $600B in actual stimulating spending.  At best,  the GOP would allow making up $1T of the $2T shortfall -- half -- and so you're still going to have a contracting economy, and serious unemployment.  The Republican obstructionism guaranteed further unemployment. 

And now voters are angry at Democrats for not improving the economy, and are going to throw the House and maybe the Senate to the Republicans -- the people who are responsible for keeping them unemployed and in a contracting economy.",finance,2010-09-12,-0.1980955243678234

Economics,Can we blame France for the Great Depression?,"The gold standard was a key factor behind the Great Depression, but why did it produce such an intense worldwide deflation and associated economic contraction? While the tightening of U.S. monetary policy in 1928 is often blamed for having initiated the downturn, France increased its share of world gold reserves from 7 percent to 27 percent between 1927 and 1932 and effectively sterilized most of this accumulation. This “gold hoarding” created an artificial shortage of reserves and put other countries under enormous deflationary pressure. Counterfactual simulations indicate that world prices would have increased slightly between 1929 and 1933, instead of declining calamitously, if the historical relationship between world gold reserves and world prices had continued. The results indicate that France was somewhat more to blame than the United States for the worldwide deflation of 1929-33. The deflation could have been avoided if central banks had simply maintained their 1928 cover ratios.

Economics,Why won't the fed release the bailout information?,"A couple of years ago, the U.S. Federal Reserve loaned some money to some banks. In fact, they loaned the money to a lot of banks, and they loaned a lot of money to them.

Now Bloomberg and some other news companies would like some details on these transactions, such as the bank, the amount loaned, and the collateral used to back the loan. I would like to see those details, too, but not many people care about that.

Bloomberg filed some Freedom of Information forms, and the Federal Reserve refused to fork over the information at all, let alone freely. 

So Bloomberg sued. And won. And won on appeal. Now the Federal Reserve has 60 days to decide whether to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. They say they can't give out that information because it will damage the banks' competitiveness.

That's a pretty lame argument, considering that these loans happened two years ago. Even if those banks were close to collapse then, they're not now. I doubt if anything too shady was going on, but all this makes me wonder why the Fed is so adamant about not releasing information. They are spending all kinds of money on legal fees to avoid releasing this information that should be public to begin with.

So this morning I jumped on their website eager to purchase a pair of headphones and a couple of color options had, in fact, been added: blue and red!

I was a bit miffed at this point and sent an email back to John and asked him what was going on. He extended his apologies and said that the Black and White are currently out of stock and that he did not realize that when I sent my first email. He did, however, offer to ship me out a pair of the same model headphones that comes with a Virtual 7.1 soundcard and they would comp the cost of shipping as this bundle was available in black. Well the gesture was totally awesome on their part I couldn't justify the $109.99 purchase since I have a 7.1 soundcard in my box thus I would never use said USB adapter. I told him thanks for the offer but I just couldn't justify the purchase because of the aforementioned reasons.
He sends me back another message that the gist of was ""You have been patient with us through this process and it is obvious you want the headset so I am going to send you the [more expensive unit] for what you would of spent on the cheaper unit with shipping"" This worked out to be about a $20.00 credit!

Sooner or later it will all come to light!

This could be a scandal of epic proportions and one that makes Nixon's Watergate or   Clinton  's Monica Lewinsky affair pale by comparison. Why was there neither rhyme nor reason as to which dealerships of the Chrysler Corporation were to be closed?

Roll the clock back to the weeks just before Chrysler declared bankruptcy. Chrysler, like GM, was in dire financial straits and federal government ""graciously"" offered to ""buy the company"" and keep them out of bankruptcy and ""save jobs.""

Chrysler was, in the words of Obama and his administration,  ""Too big to fail,"" same story with GM.

The feds organized their ""Automotive Task Force"" to fix Chrysler and GM. Obama, in an act that is 100% unconstitutional, appointed a guy named Steve Rattner to be the White House's official Car Czar - literally, that's what his title is.

Rattner is the liaison between Obama, Chrysler, and GM.

Initially, the national media reported that Chrysler 'had made this list of dealerships'. Not true!

The   Washington  Examiner, Newsmax, Fox News and a host of other news agencies discovered that the list of dealerships was put together by the ""Automotive Task Force"" headed by no one other than Mr. Steve Rattner.

Now the plot thickens.

Remember earlier we said that there was neither rhyme nor reason why certain dealerships were closed?

Actually there's a very interesting pattern as to who was closed down. Again, on May 27, 2009, The   Washington  Examiner and Newsmax exposed the connection.

Amazingly, of the 789 dealerships closed by the federal government, 788 had donated money, exclusively to Republican political causes, while contributing nothing to Democratic political causes. The only ""Democratic"" dealership on the list was found to have donated $7,700 to Hillary's campaign, and a bit over $2,000 to John Edwards. This same dealership, reportedly, also gave $200.00 to Obama's campaign.

Does that seem a little odd to you?

Steve Rattner is the guy who put the list together. Well, he happens
to be married to a Maureen White. Maureen happens to be the former
national finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee. As
such, she has access to campaign donation records from everyone in the
nation- Republican or Democrat. But of course, this is just a wacky
""coincidence,"" we're certain.

Then comes another really wacky ""coincidence.""

On that list of dealerships being closed down, a weird thing happened
in   Arkansas  , North Louisiana, and   Southern Missouri  . It seems that
Bill Clinton's former White House Chief of Staff, Mack McClarty, owns
a chain of dealership in that region, partnered with a fellow by the
name of Robert Johnson.

Johnson happens to be founder of Black Entertainment Television and
was a huge Obama supporter and financier.

These guys own a half dozen Chrysler stores under the company title of
RLJ-McClarty-Landers. Interestingly, none of their dealerships were
ordered closed - not one!

While all of their competing Chrysler/Dodge and Jeep dealership were!

Eight dealerships located near the dealerships owned by McClarty and
Johnson were ordered shut down. Thus by pure luck, these two major
Obama supporters now have virtual monopoly on Chrysler sales in their
zone.

Isn't that amazing?

Go look in The   Washington  Examiner, the story's there, and it's in a
dozen or so other web-based news organizations; this isn't being made
up.


Now if you thought Chrysler was owned by Fiat, you are mistaken. Under
the federal court ruling, 65% of Chrysler is now owned by the federal
government and the United Auto Workers union!

Fiat owns 20%.

The other 15% is still privately owned and presumably will be traded
on the stock market. Obama smiles and says he doesn't want to run the
auto industry.

As horrifying as this is to comprehend, and being as how this used to
be the   United States of America  , it would appear that the president has
the power to destroy private businesses and eliminate upwards of
100,000 jobs just because they don't agree with his political agenda.

This is Nazi   Germany  stuff, and it's happening right here, right now,
in our back yard.

There are voices in   Washington  demanding an explanation, but the
""Automotive Task Force"" has released no information to the public or
to any of the senators demanding answers for what has been done.

Keep your ear to the ground for more on this story. If you've ever
wanted to make a difference about anything in your life, get on the
phone to your national senator or representative in the House and
demand an investigation into this.

Benjamin Franklin had it right when he said, "" Al l that's necessary for
evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.""

Car Czar No More

An amazing thing happened as this story was going to press. Obama's
Car Czar, Steve Rattner, resigned on July 13 and was promptly replaced
by former steel workers union boss Ron Bloom.
According to CBS News, Rattner left ""to return to private life and
spend time with his family.""

Treasury Secretary  Tim Geithner said, ""I hope that he takes another
opportunity to bring his unique skills to government service in the
future.""

By the way, Rattner is under investigation for a multi-million dollar
pay-to-play investment bank scandal in   New York  ....

Uh-oh!

But, we're certain that had nothing to do with his resignation.

And, according to several news sources out there, there are rumors
he's being investigated for what could be pay-to-play scandal
involving the closing of Chrysler and GM dealerships. Really? Again,
that couldn't have anything to with his resignation-that's ridiculous!
Like CBS said, this guy just wants to ""spend more quality time with
his family.""

Obama has 32 personally appointed ""czars"" who answer to no one but
him, all of whom are acting without any Constitutional authority.

But hey, we're sure they all have ""unique skills,"".....as  Tim
Geithner likes to say!

Economics,The Buying Power of Debt,"Let me preface this by saying I'm an economic neophyte. In this recession, I understand the following to be true (if these are incorrect, please let me know):

1) People are paying back debts and banks are not loaning out as often, therefore destroying wealth-in-play due to the asymmetric nature of loans and debt.

2) With an influx of people, any closed system will experience deflation as there is less wealth per person unless the base money supply is increased. This assume no factor increases the momentum of money.

3) If imports are greater than exports, then money is flowing out of the system, reducing the wealth per person.

That being said, a few questions:

A) Does the government have the ability to just add money to the money supply (without taking on additional debt)? If so, which organization is responsible for this (The Treasury, The Fed?) and do they need any kind of approval to do so?

B) Is there an economic system that can automatically adjust to growth/loss of population without resulting in inflation/deflation?

C) Is there a way to limit the elasticity of wealth in play by some method, maybe ""Debt credits"" rather than limiting a certain reserve holding amount? The 10% reserve required now still allows for massive elasticity (anywhere from 1x to 10x the money supply) which can be problematic if sentiment changes for businesses, as we've seen.

Since the DREAM Act was recently put in the spotlight, I figured it might get a few more responses this time. tl;dr at bottom*

Here's the bill as it exists in the Senate: [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.729:](http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:S.729:).

* The alien is not deportable under certain smuggling, criminal, or terrorist grounds
* The alien has earned a high school diploma or GED, or has been admitted to an institution of higher learning
* The alien has never had a judicial deportation order, unless the alien either stayed in the US under the color of law after the order was issued; or received the order before turning 16
* The alien is 34 or younger at the date of enactment of the Act

**Benefits:**

* The Attorney General shall stay the deportation of any aliens who qualify under (most of) the eligibility requirements above, are at least 12 years old, and are a full time student in primary or secondary school
* These students will be eligible to work, consistent with labor laws and minimum employment ages
* The stay shall be lifted once the alien is no longer enrolled in a primary or secondary school, or no longer meets the eligibility requirements above

It's a lot to take in, but that's the main summary. Hopefully I didn't leave too much out.

Many consumers have given up on their credit scores (mostly Baby Boomers). The ones who aren't maxing their cards out just to live due to unemployment or increases in cost of living have decided to just max their cards out with vacations and consumer goods. I was talking to someone last night (Baby Boomer from an uppermiddle class neighborhood) that said the mentality now in that social group is  ""debt is just the American way. Look at how much debt the federal government is in!"". Seems like many recent economic reports are showing that consumers aren't de-leveraging voluntarily, it's mostly through forced bankruptcy.

Student loan debt surpassed consumer debt last month for the first time...ever. Kids are coming out of school with either no job prospects or ridiculously low wages that don't even cover interest payments on the debt. This is clearly not sustainable.

She teaches ""stop forclosure"" classes for free to attorneys and judges and has offered them across the country. She only requires that those attending give a certain number of pro bono hours.

The case that gave GMAC a huge case of the ""Oh Shit"" 's was [decided by a judge](http://www.zerohedge.com/article/jpmorgan-brings-foreclosure-case-mortgage-which-it-was-just-servicer-court-finds-bank-commit) who is also from Jacksonville. I don't know if Judge Jean Johnson has ever been to one of Charney's seminars, but her finding that JP Morgan has no standing in the foreclosure and that it has committed a fraud against the court leading to a dismissing with prejudice seems to me that she is in agreement with Charney that the banks can't prove who owns what.   

And this finding is what caused GMAC to stop all foreclosure proceedings.

I don't agree that people should be able to walk away from their houses and financial obligations, but the financial deck has become so stacked against the consumer with arbitrary interest rate increases, credit line decreases, payment discrepancies etc., all while we the taxpayers are bailing out banks to the tune of billions, that I'm not so against it anymore.",finance,2010-09-22,-0.1844580394114933

gaming,Japanese RPG's Are on the Verge of Extinction. The Square-Enix we knew is gone.,"A little dramatic? Absolutely. Far from the truth? Not as much as you may think.

Hello fellow redditors, this is one of my novelty accounts. I do quite a bit of writing on the side and I wanted to share some of my viewpoints with you on how I see the gaming world. I hope we can share some opinions. I also really appreciate honest criticism of my writing style. If you don’t like something let me know.



I have been a gamer as far back as I can remember and RPG's were amongst the first games that exposed me to the hobby I love so much. A demo I received from the Playstation Underground (Remember that?) threw me headlong into my first *3D* JRPG (and exposed me to the Japan where I saw things I could not unsee). That game was Final Fantasy VII (FFVII).


It is no secret that Square had something great on their hands with FFVII. It helped pave the way for 3D console RPGs and set the bar in terms of quality. It was an excellent game, but was it the OMFG BEST GAME EVAR!!1@!! as so many fanboys (and girls) claim it to be? Simply put, no. However, if it wasn't for Square's efforts and the high quality game they produced we wouldn't have some of the classics we have today.


The Playstation and Playstation 2 era absolutely capitalized on the success of FFVII. The JRPG triumphed for years and there were very few other genres that could even scratch the surface of their popularity. They were so successful because they implemented gameplay elements that other game genres could only dream of emulating. They were the pinnacle of storytelling, character development, sense of spectacle, and implementing the ""suspension of disbelief""* which drew players into their fantasies and allowed them to utilize their imaginations.


Unfortunately, with this current generation of consoles and gamers, these same defining characteristics are also proving to be their downfall. With that being said, this is where I begin to tear down the genre I so dearly love.


I'm just going to come out and say it; JRPGs are intolerable nowadays. I can't think of a JRPG in this current console generation being the Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 (this does not include handhelds) that displays or invokes the same quality of the previous generations. I believe that this stems from an unwillingness to change certain conventions of these games. This also doesn’t necessarily mean these conventions are bad (I enjoy the character depth, actual gameplay and level of intricate detail) they have just become stale or downright inappropriate or misplaced.


The first thing that has me up in arms is the plot lines and characters in JRPGs. I can think of an innumerable amount of JRPG's that use the same formula. ""Angst filled teenagers save the world."" Think about it, that is literally the central theme of every major JRPG out there. Is it too much to ask for some adults? Final Fantasy XIII just so happens to be the latest culprit associated with this plot travesty and also the inspiration for this note. Take James Cameron's Avatar as an example, despite a plot that has been done in hundreds of other movies, books and games it was still able to keep the viewer engaged and leave a lasting impression. This was due to the beauty of the directing, set pieces, writing and the viewer’s emotional involvement or ability to empathize with the characters.

 
Many of these JRPGs can get some, but not all of these characteristics to mesh well. This causes detachment in the overall enjoyment of the game. Take FFXIII for example. The directing and set pieces are practically breathtaking, but the characters and writing are totally convoluted and ridiculous. This destroys the suspension of disbelief and any immersion** that may come with it. This also removes the ability of the player to empathize and relate with the characters in the game.

 
Along those same lines, voice acting and dialog have not stood up to quality control. Great voice actors are easy to come by, but it seems JRPGs challenge themselves to stay as far away from these talented individuals as possible. Take the game ""Chaos Wars,"" it has some of the worst voice acting you may ever hear. Be forewarned before clicking this video, if your ears begin to bleed pause the video immediately. I assume no responsibility if you decide to stab your eardrums in a fit of audio rage. I liken the way these voice actors sound to the way a cat may sound when its tail gets caught in an automatic can opener (Karol from Tales of Vesperia comes to mind-shudders). It is really too bad because scores of translators do an excellent job of localizing the dialog for English speaking gamers. This does not, however, mean it is good.

[50 Worst Video Game Lines](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulbotKa5LnM&amp;feature=related)


Another major issue that affects many JRPGs is an inconsistent conveyance of emotion. It seems to be a trend in anime, Japanese movies and games to inject misplaced comedy in dramatic scenes and situations. This causes a major rupture in the enjoyment of the game. Using FFXIII as an example once more, during the first 20 minutes of the game it committed this faux pa twice. During a battle sequence where people were literally being gunned down a young character was complaining about having to fight and save lives. A joke was made about taking a nap in the battlefield. At this point I actually scoffed. It's annoying and completely destroys any immersion that was previously built. Examples of this can be found in almost every JRPG out there. Sometimes it really does work, but the vast majority of the time it is a complete hindrance. I could also go into the extremely annoying character sounds effects such as cooing, grunting and exasperation that are totally overused, but I feel I got my point across.


In the same vein of emotion, many JRPGs also suffer from awkward displays of affection. Character interactions become out of place or just downright uncomfortable. This is especially prevalent in games that are very realistic like FFXIII or Heavy Rain (I’m aware it isn't an RPG). The more realistic the game the closer it comes to the ""uncanny valley""***. This causes repulsion from the player attempting to enjoy the emotional scene. Scenes between a male and female character that are supposed to convey affection become extremely awkward and uncomfortable to watch. Secretly it makes you think ""I really hope no one is watching what I am playing right now."" You feel almost embarrassed. I'm sure you know the feeling. This isn't something that doesn't exclusively affect JRPGs, but it definitely rears its ugly head far more often in them.


When these are presented by themselves they can be worked around without too much issue. However, most JRPGs suffer simultaneously from almost everyone one of these characteristics. These characteristics were very present towards the end of the PS2 era and in almost EVERY JRPG this generation. I honestly cannot think of an exception to this trend. Games like Tales of Vesperia, Lost Odyssey and Valkyria Chronicles which are good, still suffer from a number of the issues I brought up. It is obvious that Japanese game makers heed the cries from their fans because they are constantly improving traditional gameplay mechanics (I love FFXIII's battle system), but they are completely overlooking the simple yet extremely important facets that define the quality of their games.

 
Major changes need to be made in these fields before JRPGs can once again be embraced by Western audiences who have become accustomed to extremely top tier games that developers like Bethesda, Bioware and Blizzard can consistently produce (All B names... coincidence?). If not, I am afraid that the JRPG will soon be a dying breed left to stagnate on the shelves Otaku's**** worldwide. 
For now I will still rally my support behind companies like Atlus and Level 5 who consistently look to challenge the conventions of JRPG’s and game culture as a whole.


**Explanation of Terms:**

*Suspension of disbelief or ""willing suspension of disbelief"" is a formula named as such in English by the poet and aesthetic philosopher Samuel Taylor Coleridge to justify the use of fantastic or non-realistic elements in literature. Coleridge suggested that if a writer could infuse a ""human interest and a semblance of truth"" into a fantastic tale, the reader would suspend judgment concerning the implausibility of the narrative.

**Immersion: This is a term in gaming used to define the ability of the player to become completely engrossed in the game they are playing. They, in a sense, feel the reality of the game is their own reality. It is very difficult to truly emulate this.

***Uncanny Valley: is a hypothesis regarding the field of robotics generally. The theory holds that when robots and other facsimiles of humans (3D Humans) look and act almost like actual humans, it causes a response of revulsion among human observers. The ""valley"" in question is a dip in a proposed graph of the positivity of human reaction as a function of a robot's lifelikeness.

****Otaku: An Otaku is someone who is obsessed with primarily, anime, manga and video games. They can also have unorthodox sexual attraction to these same things primarily in relation to anime.

**tl;dr** Top Tier “blockbuster” Japanese RPG’s need a major overhaul outside of Japan if they are going to continue to compete with the Western RPG giants like Bioware and Bethesda. They no longer appeal to the adapting audiences found in the U.S. and Europe. This is due to the lack of willingness to change certain conventions of their games, most notably plot characteristics and the injection of sub cultures/interests relevant specifically to Japan.

The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.

Come winter, the ant is warm and well fed.

The grasshopper has no food or shelter, so he dies out in the cold.

MORAL OF THE OLD STORY:

Be responsible for yourself!

MODERN VERSION

The ant works hard in the withering heat and the rain all summer long, building his house and laying up supplies for the winter.
 
The grasshopper thinks the ant is a fool and laughs and dances and plays the summer away.

Come winter, the shivering grasshopper calls a press conference and demands to know why the ant should be allowed to be warm and well fed while he is cold and starving.

CBS, NBC , PBS, CNN, and ABC show up to provide pictures of the shivering grasshopper next to a video of the ant in his comfortable home with a table filled with food.  America is stunned by the sharp contrast.

How can this be, that in a country of such wealth, this poor grasshopper is allowed to suffer so?

Kermit the Frog appears on Oprah with the grasshopper and everybody cries when they sing, 'It's Not Easy Being Green ...' ACORN stages a demonstration in front of the ant's house where the news stations film the group singing, “We shall overcome.” 

Then Rev. Jeremiah Wright has the group kneel down to pray for the grasshopper's sake. 

President Obama condemns the ant and blames President Bush, President Reagan, Christopher Columbus, and the Pope for the grasshopper's plight.
 
Nancy Pelosi &amp; Harry Reid exclaim in an interview with Larry King that the ant has gotten rich off the back of the grasshopper, and both call for an immediate tax hike on the ant to make him pay his fair share.

Finally, the EEOC drafts the Economic Equity &amp; Anti-Grasshopper Act retroactive to the beginning of the summer.

The ant is fined for failing to hire a proportionate number of green bugs and, having nothing left to pay his retroactive taxes, his home is confiscated by the Government Green Czar and given to the grasshopper. 

The story ends as we see the grasshopper and his free-loading friends finishing up the last bits of the ant’s food while the government house he is in, which, as you recall, just happens to be the ant's old house, crumbles around them because the grasshopper doesn't maintain it.

The ant has disappeared in the snow, never to be seen again.  The grasshopper is found dead in a drug related incident, and the house, now abandoned, is taken over by a gang of spiders who terrorize the ramshackle, once prosperous and peaceful, neighborhood.

The entire Nation collapses bringing the rest of the free world with it.

MORAL OF THE STORY:

Be careful how you vote in 2010.  I've sent this to you because I believe that you are an ant – not a grasshopper !
 

Make sure that you pass this on to other ants. Don't bother sending it on to any grasshoppers because they wouldn't understand it, anyway

Do you know who the real grasshopper is?  The banks.

Do you remember how President BUSH came on national TV reprising his 9/11-nation-is-under-attack performance to urge everyone to give the banks free money?  PRESIDENT BUSH BAILED OUT THE BANKS!

In an economy where there is 1 job for every 5 applicants I find the moral of this story, where it references working-class people not working, incredibly out of touch.

The grasshopper hasn't been ""out enjoying the summer"".  He's been sweating it out b/c he can't afford the electricity bill since the financial crisis destroyed the economy.

There have been many points made on Reddit, and I think we need to pick the 10 most important and use the rally in DC to demand these changes of our leaders. Here are some that resonate in this community:


1- **Eliminate lobbyists and reform campaign finance** - our lawmakers are literally bought and sold, legally, by corporations and the rich.

2- **No more corporate bailouts** - Capitalism tends to work itself out.

3- **Reduce federal spending** - favorite targets of Reddit are undocumented foreign aid, reducing high tech military spending and tax breaks to profitable companies (such as oil subsidies).

4- **Tax reform** - Warren Buffet says he pays half the tax rate that his secretary does. We need to modernize the tax code and tax fairly across financial classes.

5- **Election reform** - a significant percent of votes nationwide are placed electronically without paper backup or any way to audit. A voter’s holiday and fines for not voting are also popular ideas.

6- **Audit the federal reserve** - the private company that controls our currency has not been audited in modern history.

7- **Bring back constitutional rights** - net neutrality, free speech zones, warrant-less wiretaps and searches, restrictions on photography and videography in public places and the Patriot Act are all un-American and unconstitutional. Let bring back the “Land of the Free and the Home of the Brave”.

8- **Respect international law** - torture, assassination, extraordinary rendition and other violations of US and international law weaken us.

9- **Green Energy** - There was once something called American Ingenuity: can you imagine if they told Edison that candles were good enough, or told Ford the horse and buggy was the only answer, or Bell that no one wanted the telephone? We can invest in the future now, or we can continue to export our money to foreign lands for oil.

10- **Greater state’s rights and freedoms** - issues like drug reform, education, death penalty, euthanasia and possibly even abortion are too controversial to be handled at a federal level. Back off and let the states decide.


Other popular targets are prison/justice system reform, further health care reform, elimination of “Corporate Personhood/Citizenship”, ending the prohibition on drugs, reforming the FDA, and even the reforming political system to eliminate the two party system.


Please let us know your thoughts and suggestions! Many thanks for your time and patience in reading this long post.

READ TO THE VERY END!   VERY ENLIGHTENING!!! AND VERY DISTURBING!!!


By Dewie Whetsell,  Alaskan Fisherman. 
As posted in comments on Greta's article referencing the MOVEON ad about Sarah Palin.

The last 45 of my 66 years I've spent in a commercial fishing town in Alaska.  I understand Alaska politics but never understood national politics well until this last year.  Here's the breaking point: Neither side of the Palin controversy gets it.  It's not about persona, style, rhetoric, it's about doing things.  Even Palin supporters never mention the things that I'm about to mention here.
 
1. Democrats forget when Palin was the Darling of the Democrats, because as soon as Palin took the Governor's office away from a fellow Republican and tough SOB, Frank Murkowski, she tore into the Republican's ""Corrupt Bastards Club"" (CBC) and sent them packing. Many of them are now residing in State housing and wearing orange jump suits The Democrats reacted by skipping around the yard, throwing confetti and singing, ""la la la la"" (well, you know how they are). Name another governor in this country that has ever done anything similar. 

2. Now with the CBC gone, there were fewer Alaskan politicians to protect the huge, giant oil companies here. So she constructed and enacted a new system of splitting the oil profits called ""ACES."" Exxon (the biggest corporation in the world) protested and Sarah told them, ""don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out."" They stayed, and Alaska residents went from being merely wealthy to being filthy rich. Of course, the other huge international oil companies meekly fell in line. Again, give me the name of any other governor in the country that has done anything similar.

3. The other thing she did when she walked into the governor's office is she got the list of State requests for federal funding for projects, known as ""pork."" She went through the list, took 85% of them and placed them in the ""when-hell-freezes-over"" stack. She let locals know that if we need something built, we'll pay for it ourselves. Maybe she figured she could use the money she got from selling the previous governor's jet because it was extravagant.
Maybe she could use the money she saved by dismissing the governor's cook (remarking that she could cook for her own family), giving back the State vehicle issued to her, maintaining that she already had a car, and dismissing her State provided security force (never mentioning - I imagine - that she's packing heat herself). I'm still waiting to hear the names of those other governors.

4. Now, even with her much-ridiculed ""gosh and golly"" mannerism, she also managed to put together a totally new approach to getting a natural gas pipeline built which will be the biggest private construction project in the history of North America. No one else could do it although they tried. If that doesn't impress you, then you're trying too hard to be unimpressed while watching her do things like this while baking up a batch of brownies with her other hand.
 
5. For 30 years, Exxon held a lease to do exploratory drilling at a place called Point Thompson. They made excuses the entire time why they couldn't start drilling. In truth they were holding it like an investment. No governor for 30 years could make them get started. Then, she told them she was revoking their lease and kicking them out. They protested and threatened court action. She shrugged and reminded them that she knew the way to the court house. Alaska won again.
 
6. President Obama wants the nation to be on 25% renewable resources for electricity by 2025. Sarah went to the legislature and submitted her plan for Alaska to be at 50% renewable by 2025. We are already at 25%. I can give you more specifics about things done, as opposed to style and persona. Everybody wants to be cool, sound cool, look cool. But that's just a cover-up. I'm still waiting to hear from liberals the names of other governors who can match what mine has done in two and a half years. I won't be holding my breath.
 
By the way, she was content to return to AK after the national election and go to work, but the haters wouldn't let her. Now these adolescent screechers are obviously not scuba divers. And no one ever told them what happens when you continually jab and pester a barracuda. Without warning, it will spin around and tear your face off. Shoulda known better.

You have just read the truth about Sarah Palin that sends the media, along with the democrat party, into a wild uncontrolled frenzy to discredit her. I guess they are only interested in skirt chasers, dishonesty, immoral people, liars, womanizers, murderers, and bitter ex-presidents' wives.
 
So ""You go, Girl."" I only wish the men in Washington had your guts, determination, honesty, and morals.     
I rest my case. Only FOOLS listen to the biased media.

There has NEVER been anyone in the White House at any time who has created such an army of staffers whosesole duties are the facilitation of the First Lady's social life. One wonders why she needs so much help,at taxpayer expense, when even Hillary, only had three; Jackie Kennedy one; Laura Bush one; and prior to Mamie Eisenhower social help came from the President's own pocket.
Note: This does not include makeup artist Ingrid Grimes-Miles, 49, and ""First Hairstylist"" Johnny Wright, 31, both of whom traveled aboard Air Force One to  Europe  .

I worked for a Democratic grassroots organization - the California branch of PIRG - during the summer last year when all the healthcare reform shit was about to hit the fan. I quit after three days because everyone there was just a nonsensical drone repeating the message their droning overlords decided on that day.
I spent the first day shadowing someone else and went door to door to fundraise for healthcare reform. To my surprise, we actively mislead people with false information, heavily inflated numbers, and a fear-based approach which demonized the insurance companies to get money from perspective donors. You want to call the insurance companies greedy? Anyone with half a fucking brain and an internet connection can look at this:
http://biz.yahoo.com/p/industries.html

Insurance as an industry has $40 billion in market cap, with 7.5% profit margins. Drug manufacturing, on the other hand, has a $999 billion market cap with 22% profit margins. Which industry do you think is profiting the most from this current healthcare system? Most people (read:fucking idiots who don't actually think about their own shit and just go one step at a time) see the company they hand their money to and blame them. It's easy. But that's not where the money ends up.

Hey, shortsighted reasoning without actually examining the complex issue behind the damn thing, isn't that a Republican thing to do? Blame so boogey man who doesn't actually cause all the problems, isn't that a conservative tactic?

When one of the people actually asked a very informed question about healthcare reform - ""Didn't Obama agree to a deal with the pharmaceutical companies to not use federal negotiating power to lower drug prices"" (The administration did make a deal to push for a 2% discount on future medicare prescription costs when realistically he could have pushed for 30%, this was because he did not want $300-500 million worth of ads running in each state to oppose healthcare reform)
Do you know what happened when an intelligent person asked that? The person I was shadowing just repeated his same fucking speech, 
used the same fucking catch words like this Republican douchebag on Chris Matthews: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YK0d8ENS__c

Before you get back on your high horse, just know that Democrats are fucking idiots, Republicans are fucking idiots, most people are fucking idiots. Chris Rock can explain it better than I can:

TL;DR - If you really just skipped all that text then: Fuck you, you lazy fuck. The idea that something complicated and long-winded can be compacted is the entire reason politics is just a giant clusterfuck. Take the time to do your own research before deciding on policy - never blindly follow a party.

When interest rates rise, (and eventually they must) it will crash the US economy.  Math doesn't lie, doesn't care what party you trust, or how much money you have.

Exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely.  We have to cut government spending by 40-50% or the US will die.  

Please, if there is something I am missing, explain it to me.  I'm not an economist, investor, or even someone who claims to understand macro-economics.

But I can read the graph of an exponential function, and understand what that means.

And what I see is a government that is blissfully going to drive itself off a cliff, leaving chaos, destruction and death in it's wake.

gaming,Open letter to Valve &amp; the TF2 team about the Mann Co. / Polycount patch,"Hello,

I regret to inform you that I believe you done goofed.

Let me first say that I have a vast amount of respect for the Team Fortress 2 development team, and for Valve as a corporation. When I would get into discussions (or arguments) about the PC gaming scene (and its oft-predicted demise), I would point to the TF2 team in particular, and Valve in general, as exemplars. These people are doing it right, I’d say, when so many studios were not. I bought TF2 four times - twice for myself (Xbox 360 and PC), and twice for friends.

This is why the latest patch has hit me so hard. It’s not just wrecking a game I had previously loved, it’s also destroying the image of a development team I had respected.

There still is a little of the familiar TF2 vibe alive in this patch. The graphics and item descriptions are as stylized and funny as ever. The development team is still as responsive as ever - I was particularly impressed with the promise to re-implement the item swap taunt bug (nom’ing the KGB was my favorite way to waste the setup phase).

But I was less impressed with the promise to implement Mann Co. hat recipes; in many ways, the Mann Co. hats represent everything that I hate about the new TF2. The fact that they aren’t craftable seems indicative of a lack of forethought evident elsewhere. Another example is the Holy Mackerel’s surprising spy-checking ability. The Mann Co. hats are - presently - proof of the violation of Robin’s promise (“Our goal is absolutely to try and avoid any distinction between ""free"" players and ""premium"" players”) that purchasable items would not impact gameplay. Two scouts running the same Mann Co. patch item set sans the hat are at a distinct, 25 HP difference. In addition to this distinct difference between paying and non-paying players, Valve is also sending the wrong message to the community. Even as game design elements, the Mann Co. hats are lackluster. The lack of a visual cue for the set bonuses is horrible game design, particularly in the case of the sniper. The hats’ design also pigeon-hole players into ‘sets’ for arbitrary bonuses; unfortunately, the most varied and interesting game is produced by a large number of viable loadouts, and set bonuses are a technique for reducing loadout diversity. The fact that the Mann Co. hats are twice the price of the “other” hats is indicative of a theme underlying this entire patch - system design to nickle and dime the player-base.

I will pay for games and expansions. Really. Especially when the prices are low enough (and this is a particular part of Steam’s business model I have routinely praised). However, this whole patch was designed to exact money - and this, too feels like a betrayal (“We never really think about the money TF2 makes when we’re thinking about what to do”). Every bit of the interaction design is geared towards profit. For example, crafting Polycount/Mann Co. pack items is intentionally material intensive. Instead of requiring ‘2 items’ like the old craftables, they require 1 specific item and 1 refined metal (representing 3 reclaimed metal representing 9 scrap metal or 9 items). This is particularly deceptive when one reads the FAQ: “Yes, they're craftable. They have the same recipe style (combine two items) as the other community-contributed items. “ Yes, the Polycount items are crafted from 2 items, but it really consumes 10 item drops to craft it. This change will make it significantly harder to earn all the items in a set - apparently with the intent of incentivizing purchasing the set. But what about the items we already have? Instead of forcing new nomenclature on the purchased items, the TF2 team re-named every existing item. This seems disrespectful to the players who earned (or lucked into) items in the past, and seems to be a convention merely to avoid lowering the perceived worth of the items being sold in the store.

And then there are the crates. The crates are a huge breach of etiquette purely by nature of their design. They force themselves into the player’s environment and promise a chance at a displayed list of items (always including some desirable items), if the player will only shell out a little bit of money to see what’s inside. And this is bad. The whole crate interface is designed to extort the player (and to provide a way to let them down, as the player only cares about a small subset of the game items, and if you sell them an uninteresting item, you can still sell the rest of the interesting ones later). The crates even contain unique items, only available to the micro-transaction-paying players - yet another breach of trust. The lack of a meaningful recipe for their removal is additionally hurtful.

And then there’s the poor quality and balance of the items being added. The update lacks the classic TF2 luster. Too many of the items are outright upgrades (and the hurt I feel at this is compounded by the fact that they can be bought). The sniper unlocks level the playing field between a good and a mediocre sniper. The pyro set is balance-breakingly good, after the TF2 team made a big deal of tweaking pyro balance. The heavy’s new melee weapon is game-changing, in a bad way. It’s poor.

It’s poor and it reflects on both the TF2 team and Valve. It introduces a lot of questions I hadn’t really asked before. I did, at one point, have some question as to how TF2 would support itself in the future, and spent some time imagining how that might be done. I figured that the community image was investment enough; I buy from Valve with some regularity and very, very rarely regret it. But the Mann Co. update is worse than anything I had imagined. But now, I find myself also questioning Valve - and Steam. Can I really trust that this corporate giant is as benevolent as I had (perhaps naively) hoped? I buy almost exclusively through Steam now - is this safe - let alone smart? Can I trust that my content will be accessible to me in 10 years, without additional fees?

politics,I just sent a letter to Candidate Tom Corbett for PA Gov.  Do you think I will get a response?,"I am not sure who, exactly, this will reach; whoever should read this, please understand, I only wish to initiate a civil discourse with the express interest of educating myself on the rational design of one particular element of Mr. Corbett's campaign platform.  

To begin, I would like to simply express my personal confusion with the perennial assertion of the republican political movement: that increases in taxation are undesirable to constituents.  

Certainly, I do not wish to contest that it would take a tremendous effort to locate a group of citizens, of any substantial proportion, in any constituency, that would voluntarily offer a larger chunk of their income as tax revenue.  I think that any person with a bit of common sense and even an elementary understanding of American culture can agree with that.  

However, I believe it would most likely be more difficult to round up a group of well informed individuals, with some education in economics and political science, who could agree, all partisan allegiances aside, that it is not essential that tax revenue should increase if state and federal governments seek to continue offer the American people the services that they have come to depend upon from their governments.  

Certainly, though I occasionally make a conscious attempt to remain well informed of our nation’s political endeavors, I can admit that my knowledge regarding the actions and endeavors of the bureaucracy at any given moment is shamefully incomplete.  

However, I find it difficult to develop a convincing explanation to the ubiquitous sentiment in American politics that taxes, in general, are hurting consumers and entrepreneurs, and cannot be increased, and yet, it is nearly unanimously accepted that social security, medicare, urban housing and development, defense, and many other increasingly expensive programs and services, though perhaps in need of reform, are essential services that American citizens cannot be denied without great hardship.  

Pennsylvania, as a state, if I am not mistaken, ran a multi-billion-dollar deficit last year. 

Obviously, deficit spending can be immensely beneficial.  I am not contesting that.  However, the funds that are borrowed must eventually be repaid by taxpayers.

With a record national debt, record state deficits across the nation, a recovering economy, and the crumbling infrastructure of the nation and, most important to the responsibilities of the position Mr. Corbett is seeking, the deplorable conditions of the PA infrastructure, shouldn’t the prudent course of action involve substantial tax increases?

Americans pay much less tax than almost any other group of citizens with similar economic circumstances and governments that offer comparable social services.  

Why is it the interest of Mr. Corbett to oppose tax increases, if there are substantial debts to be paid, and much expensive work to be done?  

I understand that privatization and contract auctioning can often reduce the cost of state services, though I don’t really know if these are strategies Mr. Corbett seeks to implement, here in Pennsylvania. 

I think that even if Mr. Corbett believed that tax revenue must be increased by raising taxes, he really couldn’t campaign successfully with a promise to make that a reality anyway.  Not successfully. 

No politician can promise higher taxes and expect to win.
It would seem, however, that though it may be unpopular, most likely due to a lack of education regarding economics and the maintenance of this colossal network of bureaucracies that most Americans refer to reverently as “the government”, proper fiscal policy, in this case, would be to increase tax revenue to pay for the debt that the state has accumulated by raising taxes.  
Enlighten me as to your thoughts on the matter.

Thank you,

Economics,"Hello, r/economics.  Can we talk about what a balanced federal budget actually means?","First, I should admit that I know very little about economics.  I've tried to learn some, but really, I'm more concerned than ever.  I'm hoping that maybe you all can clear up what I'm missing.

1&gt;  When we're talking about the federal budget, the difference between expenditures and revenue is different than what it would be for you and I.  For example, if there is a federal budget surplus, it means that the government has basically taken money out of the economy.  Likewise, if there is a federal budget deficit, it means that money has been added to the economy.

I suspect, however, that this is not the only place that money enters or leaves the economy.  So let's talk about money creation.

Obviously my knowledge here is limited, but when listening to interviews by people at the Fed when discussing the TARP, they were asked where that money came from.  They basically said, 'well, we just changed a field on the computer, and we had more money.'  In other words, it was created out of thin air. 

The downside to creating money this way is that it leads to inflation.  So alternatively, if you want more money, you can borrow it from another entity, which is what I assume we do most of the time.  

So my main question is really this.  Why don't we eliminate the ability to add money to economy by borrowing it elsewhere?  This way, politicians would be forced to consider the consequences of inflation when there is a huge budget deficit that requires the creation of money from thin air?  

This would also decrease the power of the Fed (if I understand this correctly), and make the federal budget the main way to control inflation.  I can see how this could be very dangerous, but hopefully the more immediate consequences of irresponsible budget practices by congress would make them think twice.

Anyway, I know this is a complicated topic, and I'm sure I missed quite a bit of nuance, and probably made some factual errors, but that's why I'm posting!  What do you think?  If I'm really far off base, where should I look to correct those problems?",finance,2010-10-05,-0.2050860479284597

politics,"OK... I am biased, I supported health care reform, this memo that went out to my entire Fortune-500 company got me pretty pissed off. How would you react?","Dear Partners:
With the 2010 midterm elections about a month away, I wanted to provide you with an update on a critical policy issue that will impact you and our business.


One of the most contentious issues this fall is the federal health care reform law, signed by President Obama last March. Throughout the country, candidates are learning just how unpopular the law is with the American public, with polls indicating that at least 60 percent of likely voters favor repeal of the law.


While [redacted] support efforts to improve our nation’s health care outcomes, we are very concerned about the costs of the new law, especially considering the economic difficulties already facing families and employers.


The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services estimates that health care costs in America will increase by $310 billion directly due to implementation and compliance with the law. These increases are beginning to be felt now. Although businesses already pay over $500 billion every year for employees' health insurance, they will need to make significant adjustments to afford the cost increases.


On September 23rd the first new provisions of the law took effect, including measures that:

prevent insurance companies from denying coverage to children because of pre-existing conditions; prohibit insurers from setting lifetime limits on coverage and restricting their use of annual limits; ensure patients may choose the primary care doctor or pediatrician they want from their plan’s provider network; and, allow children under 26 to remain on or be added to their parent’s family policy.


While these new provisions add additional benefits, they also add to healthcare plan costs.


With these and other benefits, insurers say they will be forced to raise premiums anywhere from 10 to 25 percent in 2011. This in turn will force businesses to make changes to the medical plans offered to employees and their families. While we at [redacted] will continue to offer excellent coverage to our partners, as a self-insured company, the new law will similarly affect our plans and costs.


There’s still hope for containing these costs, as candidates for elected office across the United States offer substantive alternatives to the present law. Many candidates favor a “repeal and replace” strategy to reduce the law’s burden on working families and their employers. We favor this strategy and encourage you to learn more about the candidates who best understand the challenges confronting [Redacted] and you, our partners.

politics,For Republicans and Democrats alike: 545 People,"545  PEOPLE -- By Charlie Reese

Politicians are the only people in the world who create problems and then campaign against them..

Have you ever wondered, if both the Democrats and the Republicans are against deficits, WHY do we have deficits?

Have you ever wondered, if all the politicians are against inflation and high taxes, WHY do we have inflation and high taxes?

You and I don't propose a federal budget. The President does.

You and I don't have the Constitutional authority to vote on appropriations. The House of Representatives does.

You and I don't write the tax code, Congress does.

You and I don't set fiscal policy, Congress does.

You and I don't control monetary policy, the Federal Reserve Bank does.

One hundred senators, 435 congressmen, one President, and nine Supreme Court justices equates to 545 human beings out of the 300 million are directly, legally, morally, and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.

I excluded the members of the Federal Reserve Board because that problem was created by the Congress. In 1913, Congress delegated its Constitutional duty to provide a sound currency to a federally chartered, but private, central bank.

I excluded all the special interests and lobbyists for a sound reason. They have no legal authority. They have no ability to coerce a senator, a congressman, or a President to do one cotton-picking thing.. I don't care if they offer a politician $1 million dollars in cash. The politician has the power to accept or reject it. No matter what the lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how he votes.

Those 545 human beings spend much of their energy convincing you that what they did is not their fault. They cooperate in this common con regardless of party.

What separates a politician from a normal human being is an excessive amount of gall. No normal human being would have the gall of a Speaker, who stood up and criticized the President for creating  deficits.....   The President can only propose a budget. He cannot force the Congress to accept it..

The Constitution, which is the supreme law of the land, gives sole responsibility to the House of Representatives for originating and approving appropriations and taxes. Who is the speaker of the House? Nancy Pelosi. She is the leader of the majority party. She and fellow House members, not the President, can approve any budget they want.  If the President vetoes it, they can pass it over his veto if they agree to.

It seems inconceivable to me that a nation of 300 million cannot replace 545 people who stand convicted -- by present facts -- of incompetence and irresponsibility. I can't think of a single domestic problem that is not traceable directly to those 545 people. When you fully grasp the plain truth that 545 people exercise the power of the federal  government, then it must follow that what exists is what they want to  exist.

If the tax code is unfair, it's because they want it unfair.

If the budget is in the red, it's because they want it in the red ..

If the Army &amp; Marines are in  Iraq   and Afghanistan  it's because they want them in  Iraq and  Afghanistan ...

If they do not receive social security but are on an elite retirement plan not available to the people, it's because they want it that way.

There are no insoluble government problems.

Do not let these 545 people shift the blame to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish; to lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject; to regulators, to whom they give the power to regulate and from whom they can take this power. Above all, do not let them con you into the belief that there exists disembodied mystical forces like ""the economy,"" ""inflation,"" or ""politics"" that prevent them from doing what they take an oath to do.

Those 545 people, and they  alone, are responsible.

They, and they alone, have the power..

They, and they alone, should be held accountable by the people who are their bosses..

**Provided the voters have the gumption to manage their own employees...**

We should vote all of  them out of office and clean up their mess!

For Violating Tax Laws: See What You Can Do To 
Ensure Rove Is Held Accountable","From Velvet Revolution:

More great news for our [AmericanCrossroadsWatch.org](http://americancrossroadswatch.org/) campaign, and many thanks to all those who helped. As we noted last week, over ten thousand of you have sent letters to Congress and the Department of Justice demanding an investigation of Karl Rove’s American Crossroads group for raising and spending tens of millions in secret corporate donations to support pro-corporate candidates. These letters convinced Senate Finance Committee Chair Max Baucus to ask the Internal Revenue Service to conduct a full investigation into all groups improperly using a tax-exempt status to manipulate elections. And today, a formal complaint was filed with the IRS accusing Rove’s American Crossroads group of illegally doing just that. See the complaint here. 

We have been working closely with the Campaign Legal Center that filed this IRS complaint and we expect to file additional legal complaints in the coming days with the Federal Elections Commission and the Department of Justice. Our campaign has become the go-to resource for the media, politicians and even candidates who want to know about the shadowy groups trying to buy politicians.

politics,"Will a successful, non-partisan third party in America buck the trend of empire death, and in doing so truly show what democracy is?","Let me preface my question by saying I am not in politics proffesionally or academically. Nor am I American or familiar with the specifics of its politics. Most of what I write here is all opinion based.

As per reddit and wider media I have a feeling of increasing dissapointment and hopelessness in a two party political system in America who are two of the same thanks to large lobbying influence and control by the wealthy minority. Much change is token and doesn't fully resolve issues, or ends up being a comprimise that achieves the same thing. This, coupled with a control of Media and information keeps the population misinformed and allows for a wider margin of control.

America has always been the epitome of democratic success from its independence, and many countries have modelled their systems (to various degrees) on it. Despite much of the hideous, hidden tactics used to stay top dog, I believe America owes its dominance and prosperity largely to the security and prosperity given by the ballot and leader accountability.

However, America is not that old, and like empires before it, it is in danger of imploding allowing another to rise in its place. I percieve what is going on as a potential threat to America's prosperity, at home and globally. America has fallen behind as a leader in many fields, compared to 60 or 50 years ago. There are a myriad of factors that need to be considered, and I know I am simplifying this quite a bit but my question is: **Is the formation, election and successful functioning of a third party in American politics the only democratic way out of this situation?** America has always seemingly met and defeated its political challenges with the people and by the people.

I see a successful third party with a ground swell of support WITH NO DOMINATING BACKERS a pure and distilled example of a working democracy. Many people are fed up with the current state of things on either side and all along the spectrum between Democrats and Republicans. I know a third party would not be able to please everyone (who can?) but much of the problems where the hands of the government are tied due to special interests will be easily resolved. I see much economic and technological improvement made, but I don't know about social and cultural issues (such as gay rights and homeland security).

TLDR: Will a successful, impartial third party be the great democratic solution in America that will translate to real action and transparency? Is this even possible?

politics,"In 1945, Harry Truman said to Herbert Hoover, ""Do you want to see the Great Depression return?"" Hoover took on the job of administering the Marshall Plan...","By the mid 1940s, Hoover was fully on board with the New Deal.  He was a good, intelligent, kind man, a far better president than his predecessors Harding and Coolege, but he tried to deal with the depression using classic Republican economic policy, and for 3 years that only made the Great Depression worse.  Republican economic policy then, was essentially the same as Republican economic policy is now.

In 1945, Truman called on Hoover to become the administrator in Europe, in charge of the Marshall Plan.  He remembered that Hoover had saved perhaps a million lives at the end of WWI, when he was in charge of providing food aid to devastated Europe.  He asked Hoover to do the same thing, at the end of WWII.  But this time Hoover was asked to do even more.  He was expected to play the key role, in rebuilding the global economy.

Hoover was grateful, and worked with the utmost energy and skill, applying New Deal policies to the rebuilding of Western Europe.  The result was 3 generations of peace and prosperity in Western Europe, while Eastern Europe and Russia stagnated.  Other Americans helped Japan rebuild, with similar spectacular results.

The economic engine created by the Marshall Plan carried the USA even after our later leaders forgot how the prosperity of the West had been created.  The life-draining waste of the Vietnam war, the little wars of the Reagan era, the nuclear arms race, and the Gulf war couldn't sink the US economy, although each war put us behind, relative to Japan, Korea, and Western Europe.  Our economy was in first place, but the rest of the world was catching up.

Now we live in a world where China has finally emerged as one of the most important economic powers in the world.  The world economy that Harry Truman, John Galbreath, and yes, Herbert Hoover planned at the end of WWII is finally changing in a fundamental way.  The questions at this juncture are:

1. In 2010 will the leaders in the USA reassert the policies that led to the Great Depression? 

2. Will the American electorate choose a Congress dominated by people who have no idea what they are doing? ... and ... 

3. Will the American Congress be able to drag the entire world back into another Great Depression?  Or will the USA become a third world country, impoverished by endless wars, while better-led countries take over as the leaders in a vibrant world economy?

Edit: Sources are Truman's biography and interviews with (I think) David Suskind, which are available both in book form and in video, and John Kenneth Galbreath's historical and autobiographical works.",energy,2010-10-07,0.0346520614331305
Economics,Help! Does this argument on government jobs stand up to scrutiny?,"Can anyone in economics find any holes in these numbers and this argument about how much of the population is supported by the government?

The total workforce in the US is about 150 million.

The total government workforce (state, local, and federal) (minus teachers) is 12 million (8% of the workforce)

There are 6 million public teachers (4% of the workforce)

The government also indirectly employs some 14 million outside contractors to do work. (9% of the workforce)

if these numbers are correct then 32 million workers, or 22% of the workforce are employed by the government through direct or indirect means. nearly 1 in 4.


Also some 41 million Americans are on federal welfare, now i would imagine that if you are on welfare you aren't included in the original 150 million person workforce, so lets include them and say 191 million people are paid in this country (this is excluding retirees obviously).... now let's re-calculate the above numbers to reflect this additional pool of ""workers"" and not over inflate the numbers in the argument.

The total government workforce (state, local, and federal) (minus teachers) is 12 million (6% of the ""workforce"")

There are 6 million public teachers (2% of the ""workforce"")

The government also indirectly employs some 14 million outside contractors to do work. (7% of the ""workforce"")

Welfare recipients 41.8 million (22% of the ""workforce"")

So if those numbers i have are correct that means that means 73 million people or 37% of the ""working"" section of the population are paid to work, or not work, directly, and indirectly by the government(s) of this nation....

And no one can figure out why the nation is broke.....

http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-3808

Here's the text with the problem:

&gt;Each Federal court shall recognize any lawful notarization made by a notary public licensed or commissioned under the laws of a State other than the State where the Federal court is located if--
&gt;(1) such notarization occurs in or affects interstate commerce; and
&gt;(2)(A) a seal of office, as symbol of the notary public’s authority, is used in the notarization; or
&gt;(B) in the case of an electronic record, the seal information is securely attached to, or logically associated with, the electronic record so as to render the record tamper-resistant.

OK, seems innocuous, right? It's just ""Hey, if you get a document with a notary seal, accept it?

Except for this line right here:

&gt;Each Federal court shall recognize *any lawful notarization* made by a notary public licensed 

OK - now, you're a bank, and you just got busted because the state laws state that when you review a foreclosure notification, you have to understand the document details, and when you sign off on it, it means ""I get what's going on here, and agree to foreclose on this house.""

Problem is, recent hearings showed that bank foreclosure personnel were processing *thousands* of such documents a week, so many that they clearly had no more than 30 seconds to read through the documentation before just signing off on it. So now the banks have to go back and start all over again and show in legal detail that yes, they own all of the legal paperwork to foreclose on this home.

However - and please correct me if I'm wrong - this law which was undebated and pushed through without a whisper of controversy says ""OK, if there's a notary seal on it, then the *courts have to accept that when the notary seal is on it, that means they really know what's up. You can't ask them if they really get what's going on, the fact that there's a seal on there means you must simply accept that the document has been properly and legally reviewed*.

It still allows the possibility of the judge saying ""I'm going to check for legal errors"", but they can't question whether the signer of the document legally followed their obligations to review each document and understand what's going on - the notary seal is there, so the judge has to say ""I must accept that the signer from the bank knows about the details of this document, and any errors are just human.""

Am I wrong here, or is there a serious problem that's giving big banks the loophole they want?

tl;dr This law would make courts accept the signatures on legal documents such as foreclosure documents without having to question the reviewing process to make sure it was legally vetted properly, so bank can continue to cram foreclosures through the courts.",cryptocurrency,2010-10-07,-0.1373772453101363

Freedom and innovation are defined by a rebellious nature and the ability to express your ideas without worry that they will be snuffed out by the majority power. This allows a level playing field for ideas to compete and not create a system where outdated ideologies are kept alive through inherited tradition.

With that said...

The holiday's focus would not be throwing a party for America (like we do on its Birthday), it would be auditing America. We need to remember that America is supposed to work for us, so its okay to throw an office party for her once in a while, but it's been many, many years since this country had a legitimate performance evaluation.

Maybe a little social change and embracement of comparing beliefs would help everyone out. Personally, I'm always happy to say why i support something or why I am against something, and I wouldn't mind sharing that once a year and having people who disagree with me help me to fact-check my beliefs.

This is what I came up with: Penfed Visa Platinum Cashback Rewards for 5% back on gas at any gas station, Citi Forward Visa for 3% back (5 TYP = 3% cash back) at all restaurants and at Amazon.com, and finally the Fidelity 2% Amex issued by FIA Card Services for everything else.  This covers all of my major spending categories unless I can find a card that pays more than 2% back for groceries.  I am aware of the offers of 5% rotating categories offered by Chase and Discover, but, in my humble opinion, those are garbage due to caps, having to sign up for rewards, etc.  I am also aware of the Blue Cash by Amex that will give 5% on drugstores and groceries but it requires you to spend $6500 dollars on it at a reduced cash back rate (.5% general purpose/ 1% for gas, groceries, drugstores) before the high rebates kick in.

FULL TEXT OF EMAIL RECEIVED:  

&gt; January 1, 2011, the largest tax hikes in the history of America will take effect.
&gt; 
&gt; They will hit families and small businesses in three great waves.
&gt; 
&gt; On January 1, 2011, here’s what happens... (read it to the end, so you see all three waves)...
&gt; 
&gt; First Wave:
&gt; 
&gt; Expiration of 2001 and 2003 Tax Relief
&gt; 
&gt; In 2001 and 2003, the GOP Congress enacted several tax cuts for investors, small business owners, and families.
&gt; 
&gt; These will all expire on January 1, 2011.
&gt; 
&gt; Personal income tax rates will rise.. 
&gt; 
&gt; The top income tax rate will rise from 35 to 39.6 percent (this is also the rate at which two-thirds of small business profits are taxed). 
&gt; 
&gt; The lowest rate will rise from 10 to 15 percent. 
&gt; 
&gt; All the rates in between will also rise. 
&gt; 
&gt; Itemized deductions and personal exemptions will again phase out, which has the same mathematical effect as highermarginal tax rates. 
&gt; 
&gt; The full list of marginal rate hikes is below: 
&gt; 
&gt; * The 10% bracket rises to an expanded 15% 
&gt; * 
&gt; * The 25% bracket rises to 28% 
&gt; * 
&gt; * The 28% bracket rises to 31% 
&gt; * 
&gt; * The 33% bracket rises to 36% 
&gt; * 
&gt; * The 35% bracket rises to 39.6% 
&gt; 
&gt; Higher taxes on marriage and family. 
&gt; 
&gt; The ""marriage penalty"" (narrower tax brackets for married couples) will return from the first dollar of income. 
&gt; 
&gt; The child tax credit will be cut in half from $1000 to $500 per child. 
&gt; 
&gt; The standard deduction will no longer be doubled for married couples relative to the single level. 
&gt; 
&gt; The dependent care and adoption tax credits will be cut.
&gt; 
&gt; The return of the Death Tax.
&gt; 
&gt; This year only, there is no death tax. (It’s a quirk!) For those dying on or after January 1, 2011, there is a 55 percent
&gt; top death tax rate on estates over $1 million. A person leaving behind two homes, a business, a retirement account, could easily pass along a death tax bill to their loved ones. Think of the farmers who don’t make much money, but their land, which they purchased years ago with after-tax dollars, is now worth a lot of money. Their children will have to sell the farm, which may be their livelihood, just to pay the estate tax if they don’t have the cash sitting around to pay the tax. Think about your own family’s assets. Maybe your family owns real estate, or a business that doesn’t make much money, but the building and equipment are worth $1 million. Upon their death, you can inherit the $1 million business tax free, but if they own a home, stock, cash worth $500K on top of the $1 million business, then you will owe the government $275,000 cash! That’s 55% of the value of the assets over $1 million! Do you have that kind of cash sitting around waiting to pay the estate tax?
&gt; 
&gt; Higher tax rates on savers and investors.
&gt; 
&gt; The capital gains tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 20 percent in 2011. 
&gt; 
&gt; The dividends tax will rise from 15 percent this year to 39..6 percent in 2011. 
&gt; 
&gt; These rates will rise another 3.8 percent in 2013.
&gt; 
&gt; Second Wave:
&gt; 
&gt; Obamacare
&gt; 
&gt; There are over twenty new or higher taxes in Obamacare. Several will first go into effect on January 1, 2011. They include:
&gt; 
&gt; The ""Medicine Cabinet Tax""
&gt; 
&gt; Thanks to Obamacare, Americans will no longer be able to use health savings account (HSA), flexible spending account (FSA), or health reimbursement (HRA) pre-tax dollars to purchase non-prescription, over-the-counter medicines (except insulin).
&gt; 
&gt; The ""Special Needs Kids Tax""
&gt; 
&gt; This provision of Obamacare imposes a cap on flexible spending accounts (FSAs) of $2500 (Currently, there is no federal government limit). There is one group of FSA owners for whom this new cap will be particularly cruel and onerous: parents of special needs children. 
&gt; 
&gt; There are thousands of families with special needs children in the United States , and many of them use FSAs to pay for special needs education.
&gt; 
&gt; Tuition rates at one leading school that teaches special needs children in Washington , D.C. ( National Child Research Center ) can easily exceed $14,000 per year.
&gt; 
&gt; Under tax rules, FSA dollars can not be used to pay for this type of special needs education.
&gt; 
&gt; The HSA (Health Savings Account) Withdrawal Tax Hike.
&gt; 
&gt; This provision of Obamacare increases the additional tax on non-medical early withdrawals from an HSA from 10 to 20 percent, disadvantaging them relative to IRAsand other tax-advantaged accounts, which remain at 10 percent.
&gt; 
&gt; Third Wave:
&gt; 
&gt; The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) and Employer Tax Hikes
&gt; 
&gt; When Americans prepare to file their tax returns in January of 2011, they'll be in for a nasty surprise-the AMT won't be held harmless, and many tax relief provisions will have expired.
&gt; 
&gt; The major items include:
&gt; 
&gt; The AMT will ensnare over 28 million families, up from 4 million last year.
&gt; 
&gt; According to the left-leaning Tax Policy Center , Congress' failure to index the AMT will lead to an explosion of AMT taxpaying families-rising from 4 million last year to 28.5 million. These families will have to calculate their tax burdens twice, and pay taxes at the higher level. The AMT was created in 1969 to ensnare a handful of taxpayers.
&gt; 
&gt; Small business expensing will be slashed and 50% expensing will disappear.
&gt; 
&gt; Small businesses can normally expense (rather than slowly-deduct, or ""depreciate"") equipment purchases up to $250,000. 
&gt; 
&gt; This will be cut all the way down to $25,000. Larger businesses can currently expense half of their purchases of equipment. 
&gt; 
&gt; In January of 2011, all of it will have to be ""depreciated.""
&gt; 
&gt; Taxes will be raised on all types of businesses.
&gt; 
&gt; There are literally scores of tax hikes on business that will take place. The biggest is the loss of the ""research and experimentation tax credit,"" but there are many, many others. Combining high marginal tax rates with the loss of this tax relief will cost jobs.
&gt; 
&gt; Tax Benefits for Education and Teaching Reduced.
&gt; 
&gt; The deduction for tuition and fees will not be available. 
&gt; 
&gt; Tax credits for education will be limited. 
&gt; 
&gt; Teachers will no longer be able to deduct classroom expenses. 
&gt; 
&gt; Coverdell Education Savings Accounts will be cut. 
&gt; 
&gt; Employer-provided educational assistance is curtailed. 
&gt; 
&gt; The student loan interest deduction will be disallowed for hundreds of thousands of families.
&gt; 
&gt; Charitable Contributions from IRAs no longer allowed.
&gt; 
&gt; Under current law, a retired person with an IRA can contribute up to $100,000 per year directly to a charity from their IRA. 
&gt; 
&gt; This contribution also counts toward an annual ""required minimum distribution."" This ability will no longer be there.
&gt; 
&gt; And worse yet?
&gt; 
&gt; Now, your insurance will be INCOME on your W2's!
&gt; 
&gt; One of the surprises we'll find come next year, is what follows - - a little ""surprise"" that 99% of us had no idea was included in the ""new and improved"" healthcare legislation . . . those who backed this administration will be astonished!
&gt; 
&gt; Starting in 2011, (next year folks), your W-2 tax form sent by your employer will be increased to show the value of whatever health insurance you are given by the company. It does not matter if that's a private concern or governmental body of some sort. 
&gt; 
&gt; If you're retired? So what... your gross will go up by the amount of insurance you get.
&gt; 
&gt; You will be required to pay taxes on a large sum of money that you have never seen. Take your tax form you just finished and see what $15,000 or $20,000 additional gross does to your tax debt. That's what you'll pay next year. 
&gt; 
&gt; For many, it also puts you into a new higher bracket so it's even worse.
&gt; 
&gt; This is how the government is going to buy insurance for the15% that don't have insurance and it's only part of the tax increases.
&gt; 
&gt; Not believing this??? Here is a research of the summaries.....
&gt; 
&gt; On page 25 of 29: TITLE IX REVENUE PROVISIONS- SUBTITLE A: REVENUE OFFSET PROVISIONS-(sec. 9001,
&gt; as modified by sec. 10901) Sec.9002 ""requires employers to include in the W-2 form of each employee the aggregate cost of applicable employer sponsored group health coverage that is excludable from the employees gross income.""

Programs like education, housing, small business, labor, transportation (roads), etc. should be handled at the state or local area.

I believe in a flat income tax for any income above poverty. No deductions. 

I believe in state rights for items like drinking age, minimum wage, gay marriage, gambling, pot, speed limits, abortion, etc. If you don't like how your state votes then do something about it or move.

I don't think there should be a goal to get everyone their own house. I also don't think we should bail out homeowners or banks. When you signed the loan papers you and the bank knew that you were entering into a financial transaction that had risk.

I don't know all the answers. I don't know exactly what we should do about health care but in my lifetime nearly everything the federal government touches ends up becoming a train wreck. I think the democrats will do everything to make the insurance companies look bad and then slide full government health care in the the U.S. Anyone that works for a health care company knows the truth about profits and knows that the majority of profits are not made by the health car companies themselves.

Even though Social Security has went way beyond it's original intentions (typical government) I think society is at a point where we can't get rid of it. I think some changes can be made to the retirement age to save it for future generations.

politics,No taxation without representation,"I love this line. Only issue is it doesn't fit in our political system these days. Those with enough money can navigate the system to avoid most taxes. Corporations do this to the extreme. A small portion of the money that would have gone to pay taxes has been funneled into buying political seats and agendas that best suit their needs. The other end of the spectrum is just as bad. The very poor and lower middle class hardly pay anything with child deductions. I'm in this boat. Single dad with two kids making just over 40k. I literally pay no federal tax. Granted it's hard to think of getting by with less money coming out of my pockets, but I'd be more than happy to pay my fair share if I felt I was being represented and obtained some much needed social services. Such as cheaper Healthcare, daycare, utilities, etc. 
Fair Share is such an important ideal I'm trying to teach my children. Why is it so unbalanced in our country. I'm finishing up my Engineering Degree, but seriously think about getting into politics to pursue this agenda. Everyone pays their fair share. No more deductions. No more tax breaks. Flat tax across the board. What that % would be is beyond me, but I'm sure some folks smarter than I in economics could decide that. Sounds pretty reasonable and fair to me. Some of the people I've discussed this with question what the IRS would do. Let me tell you. They would do their job and go find people scamming the system and fine the living crap out of them. 
I'd also like to see campaign finance reformed. Everyday around election time we hear about how much so and so raised. Millions upon millions of dollars coming from who knows and going to who knows. This seems a tad screwed up. Especially given so many of us are living paycheck to paycheck, if we are even lucky enough to have a paycheck. If I did run for office, well local office, I'd accept nor spend one cent. Only relying upon word of mouth, news, and the internet. Maybe it's extremely naive, but I would rather those dollars go to pay taxes or donated to a charity.

He a extremely conservative, liberal, hating, business focused one.  Mine a liberal, everyone should be happy, social security is my retirement one.

I was an Economics major and soon realized the effects of taxes on businesses, and the hoops each business must jump through because of regulations and laws created to ""protect people"" but they were made by people who don't understand the the industry.  Yes, just like everything their are a few bad apples, but isn't that life?  There are literaly tens of thousands of companies that try very hard to do the right thing.  I am not blind, of course some are corrupt, but why do people assume all big companies are bad?  They are like any other entity, some are bad, but for the most part good.

The government should not be trusted with large amount of money.  This is because the people that handle the budget look at what is being taken in, and they look at it as ""free money"".  When someone is in a position where they are presented with lots of money without having to earn it, they spend it recklessly.  This is true for governments, individuals, and businesses.  We should be paying very little into taxes, and the money we do spend it on should go to limited, carefully watched, and every dollar counted and accounted for (like any other successful business).  Which means our government should spend a healthy, competative (in terms of the free market) amount on accountants, this way some of the best ones want to work for the government, and the lower, corruptable, less informed one's either become more educated, or don't get a job.

Why do liberals back tariff's that are presented as ""boosting domestic job growth""?  Tariff's will, in almost every case, hurt the economy of the country that imposes the tariff.

Please take a short break from my rant and look at [this](http://thumbs.dreamstime.com/thumblarge_366/12348521426lco73.jpg). If that didn't make you smile, your a heartless bastard.

Why do liberals hate CEO's?  Of course we are all familiar with [Kenneth Lay](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenneth_Lay), and other CEO's that have taken millions, however, CEO's like Steve Jobs (Love him or hate him, he is still an amazing CEO), Warren Buffett, Fred Smith (FedEx), and (why not, lets through in a bank) John Stumpf (Wells Fargo, one of the few banks doing pretty well) have created thousands (possibly hundreds of thousands) of jobs for people, and made many people multi-millionaires.

Now I pick on liberals in this article, only because that is the majority in reddit.  If I went onto a conservative site (I don't know any, sorry) I would find other things to ask about.  I am not looking to get flamed, I am just curious if anyone else out their thinks along the same lines I do.

Economics,"Does anyone else here also think that what we are going through is not solvable?  That lower taxes and/or stimulus spending is just delaying the inevitable ""new"" economy?","For thirty years we have artificially been propping up the US economy.  Low taxes, massive government spending, for the past 15 years we have had extremely low interest rates, and now we are stimulating the economy with deficits only seen previously in times of war.

We have used every trick in the book.  There's no more credit to spend, taxes are at an all-time low, interest rates are even ZERO in Japan.  And yet we are barely holding it together (if you consider 10%+ real unemployment ""holding it together"").

Am I wrong to think that this is just a long-due *correction"" back to where the economy would have been with out all this ""stimulating"" bullshit and a couple bubbles (tech, housing)?

Isn't asinine to even aim to get back all those jobs and GDP?  Wouldn't we be better off restructuring for the new (old) economy?

EDIT:
I am not a fatalist.

My point is that through the spending/tax imbalance + low interest rates we have essentially enacted a $15T stimulus over the past 30 years (actually bigger, when you adjust for inflation over those years).

We don't have these tools at our disposal at the moment:  We can't lower taxes (deficit Vs cuts to existing services in a weak economy).  We can't spend more (deficit is too high, plus we are in danger of either default OR other nations not buying our debt).  We can't cut interest rates.

I don't believe that the GOP will back off on tax cuts until we see 7%+ GDP for 4 quarters, and then they (and Wall Street) will freak out when we try to adjust them back.

I don't think the Dems will drop stimulus spending until we see 4-6% unemployment.

What if those numbers are not possible without the deficit spending combined with low taxes/interest rates of the past 30 years?

politics,"Okay, this is just getting dumb now. I don't agree with the guy's republican views, but I too am an avid history buff and guess what? War reenactments are FUN, SAFE, and EDUCATIONAL. They have NOTHING to do with political opinion.","It's kind of like reliving a dream. The time in which men and steel fought in a way that will never be the same from this point forward. WWII, WWI, heck even the American Civil War and any war for that matter, garners a large amount of interest from history buffs. There are VOLUMES of books, media, games, collectors items, reproductions, etc. that have a LOT of value in today's economy. Some people just love history. I'm one of these people.

I personally have a variety of artifacts, from model kits to reproductions of medals and hats. Some of them have swashtikas on them.... BUT GUESS WHAT? I'm a liberal leaning person. I'm not a national socialist (and in fact, I hate everything about that political stance).

If wearing a German SS uniform in a reenactment means, automatically, that I'm supporting killing of Jews, then seriously... How do you honestly put that together? A does not equal B in this context. There is a huge difference between a neo-nazi with his head shaved and sporting swashtikas in broad daylight preaching to street goers ""Kill the Jews! Kill the Blacks!"" than a history reenactment made solely for the entertainment of an audience and the love of history. You have to take these people for what they are: __they are actors, acting in a live stage play, with an emphasis on historical accuracy, education, and entertainment__. There is absolutely _nothing_ political about a live action stage play.

Seriously, I can't say it any clearer, ___some people just love history___. That is all there is to it. And guess what? Some people admire certain nations over others. I for one, being of primarily German decent, have had a HUGE interest in WWII Germany. I play many games related to WWII. I usually play Germany (not exclusively, but usually). It's just something I'm interested in.

(edit: And, in fact, from what I've seen, the players playing the ""bad guy"" team sometimes take to a more crazy/involved stance, and I've actually seen it where the ones sporting the Confederate Army, or the Japanese Army, German Army, etc., are just crazy more involved and really add to the entertainment value of the show. They know that people may think ill of them anyways, so what do they have to lose to really get into it and outshine the supposed people playing on the ""good guy"" side? It's kinda like a little battle in and of itself, actor wise, to see who can stay more in character and be more vigorously accurate. It's a really great show to see if you can ever get to one - I highly recommend it. Especially if they have some vehicles, the Hetzer being the most common (since it was post war produced in Switzerland (I think), so there are a lot of those vehicles that have been auctioned off to reenactment circles), since they have a bit of fireworks at the end of the cannon and shoot it off for the crowd - really neat)

But seriously, back to my rant. Germany in WWII, and what they were able to accomplish, was pretty crazy amazing (and I'm talking militarily, not politically). For instance, I know there are a lot of people who think France is full of people who run at the first gun shot, but guess what? France was _stronger_ than Germany during 1940. Literally stronger. Better tanks, better planes, better infantry. What lacked was that the French military had too many ""Old Guards"" in their ranks, thus they weren't willing to adapt to the changing tide of tactics, while Hitler, being crazy interested in new ideas, allowed the new train of thought to take over the military. You and I both know the result.

Hell, guess what book was on General Scwarzkopf's desk during the first gulf war? ""PANZER BATTLES"" by WWII German Maj. Gen. F.W. von Mellenthin.

Hell, guess which famous German General was sacked to the desk after having disagreements with Hitler? Heinz Guderian, the creator of the blitzkrieg war tactics.

Hell, guess which famous German General never agreed politically with Hitler but was chill about it but still wound up being forced to commit suicide? Erwin Rommel.

But guess what? War reenactments aren't really reenactments if you're only fighting against life sized stick figures made out of hay and wood. Somebody needs to play the other team. And just because you play the other team __doesn't f'ing mean you support the political ideology of that country during that time period__.

In fact, a lot of war re-enactments is all about education and fun. Everybody gets to come in and check out all the gear people are wearing. The reenactors maintain ""character"" at all times - they NEVER try to use or say or act in any way a modern person would. This includes everything from cooking food to going shit in the woods. The sense of immersion and the ability of people to observe it is really quite cool. It is a great place to take your family and learn something about history.

Reenactment groups all over the US are going to be punished severely for this blatant over reaction in the news. This f'ing sucks. I love these groups - from the US ones to the Brit ones to the German ones, hell even the Jap ones. Some do a crazy good job at reenactment, and yeah. This is _NOT_ fair to them to be the target of this anti-republican bullshit on account that it's easier to call somebody a Nazi than find a good counter point (as what VP Biden was suggesting this entire time anyways - not to mention, they're freaking republicans, how hard is it to NOT find a good counterpoint?).

politics,"Reddit, Let's have a conversation with my very conservative brother.","My brother is not a redditor, but occasionally I will send him a link to a post.  The other day I sent him this post explaining that I feel similarly to the OP and most of the comments: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dqp6l/the_two_major_realizations_that_moved_me_from/

His response was this:


""'Tis unfortunate your feel such a way.
There are many incorrect assumptions in the author's piece. First, when the author ""thought"" that free-market economics was more efficient--using his term--he was incorrect. A toltarian state is more ...efficient than any form of economy. This is why you observed more successful government works projects in China--the people are forced to do the work. More, the author chooses to use absolute phrases such as ""small government that leaves ALL possible matters up to the free-market will lead to the best system..."" Come on, that is an extrememly naive statement. No matter what percent of free-market system is employed it is never ALL-in with no government interference. Government regulation is always in play. This is an inaccurate precept for a free-market economy.
I agree with the author that there are inefficiencies in large companies, it's an easy conclusion that as the company size increases red tape increases, but this is the same for government...actually it's worse. Then the author takes a bad move by ending his only good thought with ""competition is limited or non-exisitent."" Huh? Btw, we have monopoly laws as regulated by the federal government and challenged in the courts. Large companies have plenty of competition, the only time they don't is when government gets involved ala power and cable companies. For those that need a lesson in successful businesses, there is a business aisle at your local book store. Pick up some business books like ""Good to Great"" by Jm Collins. In such books, the author's conclude that the truly great companies are sustained by energetic visions and lasting core values. For example, look up the story about the Nile River virus and the charitable, not-for-profit work Merck. It did everything in its ""greedy"" power to make the disease all but extinct on the continent with no return, completely free! Big business = greed is a Left wing ploy to turn peope to vote for big government. It's the only way they can remain in power to steal money from the taxpayers to fill the pockets of the voting base. By simply using the phrase ""lot in life"" and the term ""marginalized"" I have no doubt this person was never a Republican. This whole piece is fraudulent.
Again, I'm sorry you can't see it for what it is.
When a person makes the comment, ""Capitalism sounds great on paper, too, but it fails to meet broad interests of society.."" WHAT!?? Corporations, businesses, and the like exist because each meet a need or want of the given society!!! Read Drucker--the godfather of modern business. No company exists or will sustain if it is not needed by the consumer. Jeez, such backwards unrealistic thinking. And you agree with these people?
If you want to discuss greed, just look at your politicians in Washington: Charlies Rangel, Chris Dodd, etc. There isn't a more greedy group of scoundrels and liers on the face of the planet and you want them to have more power. Really?""

politics,How about starting a new global political movement? Some ideas and a name.,"The key to a successful movement is to eliminate from the table  everything that divides us. The ""transnational super elite"" divides and conquers, this we know. I won't go over all of the divisions upon which they thrive, we all know what they are. But I would just like to  point out the absurdity of one of these divisions, the left v right paradigm, by saying that these crooks have shown they can rob you blind under socialism (see Europe) and under crony capitalism (see here). Now watch China. The political structure is of no concern to them, as they have conquered them all. There are no ideological debates taking place at fortune 100 board meetings. They have their eyes on the prize, which is everything the bottom 99% owns, our rights included.

So the point here is to avoid discussion within the movement of anything other than the goals of the movement. This goes for discussing the movement with others. Do not get diverted! Try not argue with your fellow man in this time of crisis! We must stay on point and never play into the hands of those who wish to divert and divide us. We must find common ground and stay united on that ground.

I am trying to establish that ground now. Therefore, now is the time for debate in order to create a solid foundation.

We just need a set of goals to share, and specific action items to advance each goal across the globe. They should be brief and open to logical interpretation. There are hundreds of potential actions for each goal, but we need to focus on those which are easiest to achieve, easiest to explain, and most effective. I hope to be able to discuss this anyone who is interested. So here goes.
 
**Goal 1** - Decentralize power - 
Action - Never vote for an incumbent again, support local government over state government. Support state government over federal government. Support federal sovereignty over multinational control.

**Goal 2** - Peace -
Action - Only vote for anti-war candidates, protest for peace

**Goal 3** - Reduce inequity of wealth - 
Actions - Unionize, support unions across the globe. Boycott the Forbes 100 whenever possible. Buy local as much as possible. 

**Goal 4** - No police state -
Actions - Vote only for sheriffs, judges and other officials who openly support the cause of liberty. Support drug legalization referendums.

**Goal 5** - Publicly funded elections - 
Actions - Until goal is achieved, reject candidates who accept funding from anything other than individuals. Support all legislation intend to bring about goal 5.

**Goal 6** - Reduce consumption of corporate media -
Action - Turn off your TV forever. Do not visit corporate media websites. 

**Goal 7** - Restore human dignity - 
Action items - In progress. Suggestions welcome. What I had was too vague.

Economics,"Why deflation is good for consumers and bad for 
banks","Deflation is a good thing for consumers, and a bad thing for banks. Banks get to ride the wave of inflation from the deposits they receive and loans they give out, and are the first in line to pay people and buy buildings with inflated money. That is one reason they have the tallest buildings in a city. Banks and the FED (owned by banks, paid by banks) and economists (who get jobs at banks and the FED) try to spin deflation as bad. Deflation lets consumers buy resources and materials like oil and food for less money, and lets business owners hire workers for lower wages. Don't let them sell you on a 'deflation spiral death trap'. Remember, there is a lower limit to deflation for which people will snap up assets and resources, but there is no limit to inflation! Deflating TV and electronic prices doesn't stop people from buying them! They may wait a week or a month, but there is always a point they will buy.

1.  Address the military-industrial complex in the United States and dramatically reduce military spending.  End imperialistic foreign policy.

2. Ensure, one way or another, that every American has complete basic health-care coverage for free.

3.  Enact some sort of campaign finance reform that involves dramatically reducing the ability of large corporations to influence political decision making.

4.  Eliminate corporate welfare, corporate subsidies, and corporate tax loopholes.  Especially end corn subsidies.

5.  Start to work towards powering America completely with nuclear energy.

6.  Grant citizenship to all illegal immigrants, and then completely close off the border.  It will be impossible to increase the standard of living within the country if people are able to keep coming in from outside.  While it would be nice to increase the standard of living of the whole world, that is simply not feasible.

7.  Completely end the whole War on Drugs.  Dramatically reduce the number of people in prison for non-violent offenses, and reform the prison system so that criminals do not leave worse than they went in.

8.  Reform elementary and high school education by some sort of European-style voucher system so that competition exists between schools.

9.  Subsidize healthy foods for the poor.  This means rice, beans, lentils, spinach, tortillas, grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, organic eggs and milk.  Tax soda, high fructose corn syrup, fast food, and cigarettes.  A healthy populace means a dramatic reduction in health care costs.

politics,Hey there! I’m a republican and I love reddit but I have a feeling you won’t love me back after you read republican...,"tl;dr: I’m a republican and I believe we aren’t far apart politically, and the few differences we have a are largely bullshit non-issues to make us fight. 

I realize it’s political season and everyone gets a bit riled up. I realize the democrats may lose some ground in congress. I realize that a lot of people on the right are spewing hate messages at your beliefs. If you take a step back and take a wider view at modern American politics are republicans and democrats really that different?

Hear me out. Republicans typically proclaim they’re for smaller government, lower taxes, less corporate regulation, strong military, etc. Democrats seem to want the government to do what it can to help the people (especially on the lower income scale), have a balanced budget, holding corporations accountable, fund research, the federal government having a greater role in education, health care, etc.

I know it goes deeper than that, but that’s basically it. Now lets look at the things that really piss both sides off. Gay marriage, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the budget deficit, etc. Herein lies the problem in the case of Gay marriage if you ask most republicans if they believe the Government has a role in marriage I’d imagine a huge number would say no.

I believe democrats would probably answer at the same rate. Notice that the question isn’t if they support gay marriage, just does the government have a role? I’m pretty sure the vast majority of Americans would agree that the government has absolutely no role in marriage. Sure democrats would still support gay marriage, and a lot of republicans would be against it. The problem is right now we need a worthless piece of paper to be “married”. It serves no real purpose. Sure tons of companies use it to create joint accounts and all that crap, but if the marriage license went away are these companies going to stop doing business? It’s more or less an issue that pisses a lot off gets people motivated and passionate but it really doesn’t mean much other than to divide us.

Essentially you guys are getting trolled. HARD. Both sides.

Another example. All throughout American history we’ve fought wars on a regular basis. Outside of WWII and the Civil War whichever party isn’t in power will be against the war. Clinton had Bosnia, Bush Sr. Iraq, Reagan proxy war in Afghanistan, Carter (pretty peaceful), Ford/Nixon/LBJ/JFK Viet-freakin-nam.

It shocks me when most liberal minded people seem to forget (or just not know) that JFK started the American involvement in Vietnam and LBJ escalated it. Richard Nixon (good ole tricky dick) started the withdraw of American forces from Vietnam. It was one of his campaign promises! War is profitable. Both parties love it. No matter who is in power we will fight wars. If a Al Gore were in office on 9/11 we’d be in Afghanistan and the republicans would be bitching about nation building and sending our boys off to a foreign land needlessly. Sure he probably wouldn’t have invaded  Iraq, so I’ll give you guys that. My point is once again we’re getting trolled for political gain. About 8000 years of human history tells me Wars Happen. I’m pretty sure they were going on well before that.

The most baffling heated political debate is about balanced budgets and government spending. It’s really hard to find a historically coherent fiscal policy from other party in modern economic history. I was raised believing that republicans wanted small government, low taxes, lower spending. To my dismay G.W. Bush is one of the biggest big spenders in American history. Fiscally Bill Clinton was an amazing republican!

At the end of the day if there was a government that had low taxes, lower spending, a strong military, regulated corporations wisely, made sure that someone in a medical bind wouldn’t be left to die, provided guidelines for education, kept the budget balanced, stayed out of our personal lives. Wouldn’t that be a pretty good government? I think most reasonable people can agree to that right?

Instead of figuring out how both republicans and democrats can work towards building a government that we can all be somewhat happy with we get drug down into largely pointless arguments. What bothers me is a lot of intelligent people get so angry over relatively minor issues. Sure gay marriage isn’t minor if you’re gay. At the same time the solution is simple and most would agree just get rid of marriage licenses! Problem solved. You can still be for or against gay marriage but at that point it’s no longer a political issue. Wars Happen. Enough said. Woodrow Wilson, FDR, JFK, Clinton all democrats all got us involved in wars. As a republican I firmly believe we should use force only when absolutely necessary. Once again I believe most democrats would agree with that statement. I have no idea how democrats became the party of balanced budgets. I don’t really care. I’m for it! Most republicans will say they are. 

Anyhow if you made it to this point in my rant and aren’t blind with rage lets have a beer together one night!

My question, though, is whether or not anybody here thinks it's possible that these militia groups could band together, become more mainstream, and actually try (and succeed!?) to overthrow the government? Would it cause a broader civil-war-like conflict? I do NOT want the US to be taken over by radical religious fanatics. 

I wish luck to the FBI and hope they tread carefully in dealing with these people. Any spark could trigger an avalanche.

There have been several articles written about the rise of radical militants in the United States:

Here's an article about the rise of militias that is not in MSM, but seems interesting with lots of references:
[The Rise of The Militias](http://mediafilter.org/caq/caq.militia.html)

What do you guys think?

EDIT:  I want to be on the record that I am in principle not opposed to Militias. Indeed, I think Militias need to become more mainstream. The issue is that the ones that exist now are indeed radical. I just learned about the [Southern Law Poverty Center](http://www.splcenter.org/) and their supposed propaganda against Miltias. I am not supportive of this. 

Here is how much I think Militias are important for our democracy: We should mainstream it. Why not create programs that encourage every citizen to learn how to use weapons? Why does a militia have to be radical and paranoid? Can't it be like the boy scouts? I'm actually for gun regulation. Nothing scares me more than the fact that random people who have no idea how to use their weapons can get access to guns.

politics,"What topic, that isn't so much Red v. Blue as it is Right v. Wrong, do you wish got more attention? In what aspect of America that most of us feel is unchangeable do you want to see reform?","My apologies for the long title, but I found my idle musings couldn't be easily classified. In general, I feel that, in the long term, the inability for America to fundamentally alter that which is already in place is one of our strengths as a stabilizing force, but it also has led to our nation being slowly suffocated by metaphorical cholesterol, fat, and bad habits. Meanwhile, in the short term, our media and public attention is a retard circus being distracted by Chilean miners, 9/11 Mosques, and Lindsey Lohan. 

Thus, I began to list everything that was important to me. If you want to just mention yours and skip my wall of bullet points feel free to do so.

In no particular order:

* The voting process and the unequal population representation of The Senate
* Politician term limits 
* Fundraising reform and lobbyist neutering
* Unrelated riders on Legislative bills
* Constraining the Executive branch 
* Judges with agendas
* Government bloat, corruption, and transparency
* Police corruption and oversight
* Personal liberties v. government control
* Enacting legislation that would forbid a news network from directly and knowingly lying to the American public
* Rights/influence of corporations and big business
* Trust busting
* The Federal Reserve
* Abuse of Federal subsidies
* Environmental protection/preventing manipulation, at home and abroad (especially the destruction of the Amazon, the destruction of wetlands, and critical overfishing)
* The ethics and long-term sustainability of pesticides and antibiotics globally
* The Tax Code
* Actual health care reform
* Defending America’s physical health through diet and medicine
* The Drug (Civil) War
* “International Police” foreign policy (torture, financial backing, secret wars, unnecessary wars, and assassinations)
* Military Industrial Complex/Military size
* The rapidly declining quality of American education (And the decline of blue collar, plus the concept of everyone going to college)
* Our elderly infrastructure (roads/power grid/fossil fuels)
* Prison reform and the idea of punishment v. rehabilitation
* The practical reality of guilty until proven innocent
* Reigning in the cost of entitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, etc.)
* True separation of church and state and the taxation of religious institutions
* Lack of investment into the sciences, technology, and innovation
* The national debt
* Practical and non-xenophobic immigration solutions 
* How to seed stability, trade, the growth of infrastructure, economic growth, and increase the quality of life in impoverished America and the third world
* The United Nations: How to make it more powerful and relevant in world affairs in our stead
* Reducing American and Russian nuclear stockpiles
* Strengthening ties with the world, and especially Western Europe
* The re-establishment of The Constitution as the ultimate, infallible, and unbreakable law of the land",finance,2010-10-17,0.00446038884439

Number 1.
Your Social Security

Just in case some of you young whippersnappers (&amp; some older ones) didn't know this. It's easy to check out, if you don't believe it.  Be sure and show it to your kids. They need a little history lesson on what's what and it doesn't matter whether you are Democrat or Republican. Facts are Facts!!!
Social Security Cards up until the 1980s expressly stated the number and card were not to be used for identification purposes. Since nearly everyone in the  United States now has a number, it became convenient to use it anyway and the message was removed.[9]

An old Social Security card with the ""NOT FOR IDENTIFICATION"" message.
Our Social Security 

Franklin Roosevelt, a Democrat, introduced the Social 
Security (FICA) Program. He promised: 

1.) That participation in the Program would be 
Completely voluntary, 
No longer Voluntary 


2.) That the participants would only have to pay 
1% of the first $1,400 of their annual 
Incomes into the Program, 
Now 7.65% 
on the first $90,000 
  
3.) That the money the participants elected to put into the Program would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each year, 
No longer tax deductible 


4.) That the money the participants put into the independent 'Trust Fund' rather than into the general operating fund, and therefore, would 
only be used to fund the Social Security Retirement Program, and no other Government program, and, Under Johnson the money was moved to The General Fund and Spent 
5.) That the annuity payments to the retirees would never be taxed as income. 
Under Clinton &amp; Gore Up to 85% of your Social Security can be Taxed 
Since many of us have paid into FICA for years and are now receiving a Social Security check every month -- and then finding that we are getting taxed on 85% of the money we paid to the Federal government to 'put away' -- you may be interested in the following: 

Q: Which Political Party took Social Security from the independent 'Trust Fund' and put it into the general fund so that Congress could spend it? 
A: It was Lyndon Johnson and the democratically controlled House and Senate.

Q: Which Political Party eliminated the income tax deduction for Social Security (FICA) withholding? 
A: The Democratic Party

Q: Which Political Party started taxing Social Security annuities? 
A: The Democratic Party, with Al Gore casting the 'tie-breaking' deciding vote as President of the Senate, while he was Vice President of the  US 
Q: Which Political Party decided to start giving annuity payments to immigrants? 
AND MY FAVORITE: 
A: That's right! Jimmy Carter and the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party gave these payments to them, even though they never paid a dime into it! 
Then, after violating the original contract (FICA), the Democrats turn around and tell you that the Republicans want to take your Social Security away! And the worst part about it is uninformed citizens believe it! If enough people receive this, maybe a seed of awareness will be planted and maybe changes will evolve. Maybe not, some Democrats are awfully sure of what isn't so. 
AND CONGRESS GIVES THEMSELVES 100% RETIREMENT FOR ONLY SERVING ONE TERM!!!

The Jews are NOT promoting brain washing children in military training camps, teaching them how to blow themselves up and cause maximum deaths of Jews and other non Muslims.  The Jews don't hijack planes, nor kill athletes at the Olympics, or blow themselves up in German restaurants. 
There is NOT one single Jew who has destroyed a church. There is NOT a single Jew who protests by killing people. 

The Jews don't traffic slaves, nor have leaders calling for Jihad and death to all the Infidels. 

Perhaps the world's Muslims should consider investing more in standard education and less in blaming the Jews for all their problems. 

Muslims must ask 'what can they do for humankind' before they demand that humankind respects them.

Regardless of your feelings about the crisis between Israel and the Palestinians and Arab neighbors, even if you believe there is more culpability on Israel 's part, the following two sentences really say it all: 

'If the Arabs put down their weapons today, there would be no more violence. If the Jews put down their weapons today, there would be no more Israel .     Benjamin Netanyahu

General Eisenhower Warned Us 
It is a matter of history that when the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, General Dwight Eisenhower, found the victims of the death camps he
ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. 

He did this because he said in words to this effect:

'Get it all on record now - get the films - get the witnesses -because somewhere down the road of history some bastard will get up and say that this never happened' 

Recently, the UK debated whether to remove The Holocaust from its school curriculum because it 'offends' the Muslim population which claims it never occurred. It is not removed as yet. However, this is a frightening portent of the fear that is gripping the world and how easily each country is giving into it. 

It is now more than 60 years after the Second World War in Europe ended. 
This e-mail is being sent as a memorial chain, in memory of the, 6 million Jews, 20 million Russians, 10 million Christians, and 1,900 Catholic priests who were 'murdered, raped, burned, starved, beaten, experimented on and humiliated' while the German people looked the other way.

Now, more than ever, with Iran , among others, claiming the Holocaust to be 'a myth,' it is imperative to make sure the world never forgets. 

This e-mail is intended to reach 400 million people.
Be a link in the memorial chain and help distribute this around the world. 

How many years will it be before the attack on the World Trade Center 'NEVER HAPPENED' because it offends some Muslim in the United States ?

I really appreciate your views on the Federal Reserve and the corruption of our government by lobbyists and corporate interests.  The debate the other night sealed the deal, though.  When questioned on abortion you claimed that you would support a constitutional amendment to ban abortion.

I'm sorry, Mr. Paul, but how is that different from federally funding abortion?  Limited government means that the government does not get involved in a person's life, unless it’s to ensure their rights.  The problem with your position is that it limits the rights of people, specifically women who have had a hard time gaining the same rights as men and are still fighting that fight.  If, God forbid, your amendment was ratified this would ensure that a woman becomes a slave to her biology.  What gives you the moral high ground, your Christian sense of morality?

That is essentially what this boils down to.  You feel that your moral beliefs (most likely based on theology) are superior to those of others.  I’m almost positive that I don’t need to lecture you on the First Amendment to the constitution, which was later clarified by the Supreme Court to mean that religion and government are to be separated, but it feels like I do.  You can, “believe,” all day that life begins at conception, but it would still be wrong to enforce that belief upon the rest of us, simply because it has a theological basis.  What about those atheist that believe that life begins at the first sign of a heart beat, brain activity, or birth itself?  Are you to require them to believe what you believe by making a law about it?  I don’t care if you’re right on other issues, you are just plain wrong on this one.  I won’t be voting in the next election because I don’t agree with either candidate’s position on several issues

In closing, a piece of advice:  We, the citizens of the United States have been forced to choose between two polar opposites, left and right for as long as I can remember.  Most actual people are like me, somewhere in the middle.  In my opinion this issue shouldn’t even be an issue.  There are more pressing concerns like the imminent financial collapse and the fact that my father, a welder, hasn’t been able to find a job for two years.  Why do politicians continue this theological and moral debate when it is honestly not their place to get involved?  It is up to individuals to decide if something is in their best interests or not.  That’s called being treated like an adult.  We make mistakes and learn from them.",finance,2010-10-26,-0.2156391696391013

politics,Wrote this E-Prime Paper for a class.  Can I run for government now?,"To the editor:

With the onset of the election at hand, I believe firmly in the importance to address current shortfalls this nation faces.  An uneducated, electing public has given rise to a government that bears little accountability for the problems within this nation.  From this position, I will present my understanding of the current state of the nation and hope that you will benefit from this by opening your eyes to the problematic political system we live with every day.  As such, every problem has a source, and I shall begin there.

Many people feel that the federal budget has caused much of the turmoil within the nation.  On immediate inspection, the priorities within the US become blatantly obvious: ** *DEFENSE* **.  According to the 2011 Federal Discretionary Budget drafted by congress, approximately 63% of your tax dollars go directly toward the military.  Meanwhile, the other 37% hardly covers the necessary public services, such as education, roads, and human services.  In recent years, these public services have often faced severe cuts in funding while military spending generally goes unchecked.  Evidence of such unchecked spending occurred in the mismanagement of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction (SIGIR), the agency responsible for rebuilding services in Iraq.  According to a BBC America article In July of 2010, SIGIR reported that 96% of the $9.1 Billion budgeted to the agency, went spent unaccounted for.  Little to no records exist ensuring that an unfathomable, $8.7 Billion went into rebuilding Iraq as intended for the money.  For perspective, this outrageously enormous amount of money equates to one-fifth of the entire Department of Education budget in the US.  Yet, because this amount of money seems so grossly incredible, most Americans shrug off such reports and continue to ignorantly complain about other issues which, unbeknownst to them, actually stem from such awful management of funds. 

A major casualty to this highly unbalanced spending, US education dysfunction and underfunding has left a bruise upon America.  British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli said it best when claiming, “Upon the education of the people of this country the fate of this country depends.”  Even today, this 136-year-old quote rings true.  Public education benefits not only you as an individual but the country and society as a whole.  According to the Alliance for Excellent Education in 2009, only 71% of American students graduate from high school on time. This leaves more than one-fourth of the student population, 1.9 million students, with a history of limited and likely failed education, and many without a high school diploma.  Nathan Mains, president of Communities in School: Pennsylvania, believes increasing funding for schools will reduce the dropout rate in his state, where they lose about 170 students each day.  Meanwhile, last year in Kansas, the state legislature had to reduce education funding by $253 million.  Without proper funding for education, Kansas and the rest of the American population will continue failing to maintain this prosperous nation by electing corrupt officials that choose to represent corporate interests rather than the interests of the uneducated, and consequently uninterested public.

Resulting from an uneducated, electing public body, smooth-talking corporate paid politicians have become the norm in American government.  For much of this nation’s history, corrupted politicians have won elections; such information holds nothing new to much of the public.  However, in more recent years, corrupt politicians have become the norm, seeking to maintain their corporate interests while only attempting to barely please the public enough for reelection.  This abandonment and treachery by our elected officials has occurred recently with requirements in the much heated Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, where Chapter 48 of the bill mandates that every one over the age of 18 must enroll in an unaccountable, corporate insurance company or face a fine of $95 beginning in 2014 and up to $695 by 2016 and every year afterward.  This clear disconnection from the public feels disheartening and rather depressing.  Such requirements in bills often cause me to wonder whether well lauded programs, such as Social Security, would even have a chance to equally benefit everyone without corporate interests bearing down upon them, if passed in modern years; of course, I must then recall a bill that introduced a potential amendment to Social Security, allowing everyone to withdraw a certain amount of the money they would normally pay into Social Security and invest it into corporations on the stock market.  Allowing corporate interests to interfere with such an extremely important program presents a problem so obvious that you need to look no further than the current recession and great retraction within the stock market to understand the disaster such an amendment would have caused.  Allowing people to invest in private, corporations with money meant for Social Security would have not only hurt the large pool of funds that help pay retirees, but it would have also left almost everyone that had invested, out in the cold when it came time for them to retire.  Alas, it seems blatant that many, if not most politicians show a greater willingness to serve the companies willing to pay them the most while entirely disregarding the civic duty that we elected them to perform: acting as trustees and providing for the people.

The vastness of rampant corruption within our government has left us with only the hollow shell of a once greater nation.  This nation once held a body of people strong in conviction, able to see the nation as a whole community striving to achieve a common goal.  The US has formerly set the standard for a democratic republic in the world, paving the way for the end of the era of monarchs; this country once lead the world in modern scientific research and development, developing countless technologies in use every day; we once even pushed the limits of the human mind and body to land them on the moon.  For this once great nation to have lost its way somewhere in the past, I feel hopeful that one day, with an educated electing public, this country can and will rise to greatness once again.

politics,"Constitutional Amendment: Corporations, which can pursue neither life, liberty, nor the pursuit of happiness have the legal rights of individuals, but not the civil rights, including free speech.","It seems to me to be a logical argument that the Supreme Court thinks corporations can have any free speech they want, just like people.  I agree with this to an extent, but do not agree that such free speech can not be limited by law (which is what the ""struck down"" campaign finance laws used to do).  Limiting the free speech of a corporation is not against the constitution because people have free speech and not corporations.  People may have life, liberty, the pursuit of hapiness, love, hate, feelings, emotions, physical needs.  Corporations have none of these.  People make decisions on what is best for them and are capable of making decisions that will benefit their friends family and the U.S. as a whole, through voting.  

Now this is an important point, Corporations can NOT make such decisions.  The reason is that they are not people, corporations ADMITTEDLY exist only for one purpose- to act in the best interest of share-holders that own that corporation.  As being such corporations are not capable of being selfless.  For example, a young man and an old man are both carpenters, the boss has to fire somebody, perhaps the old man who can retire will do so because it is a selfless act of kindness for the other person.  The young man will go on working to have a good life, and this is humanity.  However, a corporation can not cease to exist.  If a young company and an old company are competing for market share they will duke it out.  Neither company can fold if they are publicly held because that company has to duke it out to try to win ""in the best interest of shareholders"".  What if one company is an electric company that only owns oil burning plants company, and another an a solar company?  The share holders of the oil burning plant company dictate that THEY HAVE TO quash the competition.  Could this competition be quashed by buying federal elections that will allow solar subsidies to expire? sure why not.  In any case, the essence of this example, is that a Corporation can not make selfless decisions.  It is not human, and has to go on existing NO MATTER WHAT, unless bought by another corporation or until it fails utterly.  Therefore corporations are only like 1 other form of life that is similar to humans, but not a human.... they are Cancer.  Only Cancer is a ""reprogrammed human cell"" that must go on existing no matter what.  It can not choose to ""apoptose"" as we say, for the better benefit of the human that the cancer lives in, because it must act according to a pre-determined, defective genetic program that means it must continue to grow no matter what.  Corporations are an example of such a biological entity that exist within our society.  They can not quit, can not cease to exist, can not make decisions to limit their growth, even if for the benefit of our society, because if they do they go against their program.  The difference between people and corporations, is people are not on a program, we can make choices that a corporation can not. 

This is why you should write your senator and representatives.  The corporations are a good our society needs, the tool of industry and economic growth, our engine.  We need them like we need lungs that breath.  But everything needs control, without limiting the free speech of corporations in elections (because they are not people!) we are basically saying that lungs are good, but I want lung cancer.  Please corporations, buy the American Federal Elections so that you can continue to exist, and provide value to your shareholders, even if it is the case that you are not human, and can do nothing selfless to help advance our society aside from holding onto your market share with a death grip that extends into the future of lawmaking to ensure your profits stay around.",energy,2010-10-29,-0.0476656219974596

   1. What was the average monthly private sector job growth in 2008, the final year of the Bush presidency, and what has it been so far in 2010?

   2. What was the Federal deficit for the last fiscal year of the Bush presidency, and what was it for the first full fiscal year of the Obama presidency?

   3. What was the stock market at on the last day of the Bush presidency? What is it at today?

   4. Which party's candidate for speaker will campaign this weekend with a Nazi reenactor who dressed up in a SS uniform?

Answers:

   1. In 2008, we lost an average of 317,250 private sector jobs per month. In 2010, we have gained an average of 95,888 private sector jobs per month. (Source) That's a difference of nearly five million jobs between Bush's last year in office and President Obama's second year.

   2. In FY2009, which began on September 1, 2008 and represents the Bush Administration's final budget, the budget deficit was $1.416 trillion. In FY2010, the first budget of the Obama Administration, the budget deficit was $1.291 trillion, a decline of $125 billion. (Source) Yes, that means President Obama has cut the deficit -- there's a long way to go, but we're in better shape now than we were under Bush and the GOP.

   3. On Bush's final day in office, the Dow, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500 closed at 7,949, 1,440, and 805, respectively. Today, as of 10:15AM Pacific, they are at 11,108, 2,512, and 1,183. That means since President Obama took office, the Dow, NASDAQ, and S&amp;P 500 have increased 40%, 74%, and 47%, respectively.

Again, thank you for sharing your comments with McDonald's. We hope to have the opportunity to serve you again soon.

politics,A rethinking of the voting process in the U.S.,"After I saw this [post about non-votes](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/dz6so/the_party_of_nonvoters_those_who_could_vote_but/) it got me thinking. There isn't a way to mobilize more voters. This is not working. People who can vote don't want to or aren't interested. Maybe they are interested and are just too apathetic or are too busy to feel like they can participate.

So instead of making people go to the polls to vote, we send the poll workers to them. Think of it as upping as the U.S. Census to every two years. The process could work like this:

1. We send people out on the street, organized just like Census workers. They get a clipboard with everyone's names,addresses, and whether they are registered to vote (no party affiliation info).

2. Workers canvas the neighborhoods, collecting census data, and supply absentee voting ballots for to every person. If a person is not registered to vote they can be supplied with a voter registration card.


***

I thought about doing some type of mobile phone system where votes to could be captured by a phone or citizens registered through sms/mobile device but this is all too complicated and costly. Simply canvassing neighborhoods and supplying absentee ballots should be effective enough in seeing a dramatic rise in the voting populace.

I don't know how this would work for local elections. I really only imagine this on a state/federal level.

I don't know what the rules are for absentee ballots if you vote by mail but then show up to the polls and vote again. Someone please comment on that?

The U.S. Census cost 14 Billion dollars. This is a great way to stimulate the economy and provide jobs for the unemployed! Conservatives always complain about welfare recipients not working, well you can put them to work doing something pretty easy and super important for our country.

edit: one last thing. The U.S. Census is ridiculously important for a lot of reasons. With more updated information we could get far more accurate information about the state of our economy, the demographics of our country and a whole lot of other things.

Most of this new money is in the hands of private bankers who sold off assets to the federal reserve, and is not being lent out due to the new regulations.  It is now more profitable for banks to buy government debt, so their holdings of t-bills are up 30%+ this year.  

Am I on track so far?

Economics,Layman has four (4) questions about that trillion dollars everyone's sick of hearing about: QE2,"Hi there!

Just so you know my background, I'm a PhD Chemical Engineer, so I'm a smart guy but completely nonexpert at economics above what I would call common sense.  I do my personal investing through a large broker and have been relatively successful, at least compared to the S&amp;P 500.  I listen to Bloomberg, CNBC, etc., but I don't have any formal training, so anytime I hear a term I don't know I go to investopedia.com to learn about it.  

Questions I have are:

1.  Has the Fed outlined exactly what the specific goal(s) of QE2 is/are?  Is it just to free up banks more?  Increase large cap growth?  Improve unemployment figures?  It seems like everyone is telling me, ""this will help the economy"" but no one quite knows what the specific result(s) will be.

2.  Did someone just pull the ""a trillion dollars"" figure out of his ass?  It seems like Dr. Evil is running our economic forecasting.  How did we arrive at that number?

3.  Am I wrong that this sort of thing is one more step in the destruction of the middle class?  My thinking is that devaluing the dollar causes the ""price"" of commodities (buildings, planes, trains, stacks of gold) to go up while Joe Worker who is holding cash gets screwed over and over again.

4.  How unprecedented is this?  Whenever I read about QE (you can't lower interest rates any more so you just start printing money), it feels like the Fed thinks we're in a dire crisis and is taking new steps which are experimental at best.  Am I wrong?

Thanks in advance for your kind and thoughtful responses,

gaming,"With all the hype around Black Ops, I reinstalled WaW last night. 6 hours later, I remembered how Treyarch earned it's reputation...","I started at 5:30, ended at 11:30.

First up, installing. I re-OSed my machine since I last had WaW installed, and changed up a lot of hardware. It's essentially a new machine on a new OS (7 instead of XP). I threw the DVD into the drive and sat while it did the 40 minute install. No problems there; I'm okay with a long install if the game is good, and I had fond memories of WaW-- nothing like the sour taste that MW2 left in my mouth.

So it installs, great. I fire it up, vaguely remembering an autopatcher. Nope, sends me to callofduty.com/update. Which redirects me to an add for Black Ops. Okay, shitty web page design. Annoying, but not a deal breaker.

Oh, you're not hosting your own patches? That actually does piss me off. Fine, whatever, I'll bite. Fileshack, give me the most recent patch. Oh, you mean there's been 7 patches with no cumulative patch? That's fucking offensive, especially since you're not hosting them and I have to get them at a capped bandwidth.

Ok, now I have all 5 patches (.3 and .1 were skippable for some unfathomable reason). Time to install them. Let's check; plenty of space on my E: drive, where the patch files are and where the install is. First patch installs fine. Great! Second patch... Out of disk space? There's 30GB there! Fine, cancel, rerun. Didn't work; now it says it can't find a valid install. Check the t00bs. It's a known issue; you have to uninstall/reinstall.

Fine, another 40 minute install. I'll play some Reach. Install completes, install first patch, fails on disk space. Cancel, fails on can't find a valid install. What the hell is going on? Then I notice my C: drive is emptying. WTF? Why is it even touching the OS drive? Everything but Windows is on E:! Fine, but now my install is corrupt, and even repairing the registry isn't fixing the install not found issue, and the installer conveniently hides the repair option and assumes when you put the disk in and hit setup you want to uninstall, rather than giving you all three standard Windows Installer options.

At this point, I'm fed up, so I find the MSI and use an msiexec /f to force it to repair. It repairs (40 minutes...), I clean space off my C: (which had 2gb, but that wasn't enough...), install the patches. Finally it works.

Launch it, configure my settings, Find Games. Set up some filters... not full, not empty, no password-- the usual. Personal preference dictates that I set the ""Hardcore"" flag to ""No"" as I loathe hardcore. Refresh. Pick a server. Can't connect.

I remember this bug. I exit, launch again, DON'T refresh, connect. Server is hardcore. Fuck this. Disconnect, connect to another server, same mode. IT CONNECTS ME TO THE SAME FUCKING SERVER I JUST LEFT. I refresh, exit, relaunch game. Can't connect to online services. Relaunch game. Can't connect. Relaunch game. Connected. Connect to a THIRD TDM server, SAME FUCKING HARDCORE SERVER. I try War; takes me to a hardcore War server, even with the hardcore filter on. Disconnect, try another War server. SAME SERVER. It doesn't matter which server I connect to; it always takes me to the same hardcore server of that mode. I can't refresh the server list without quitting, and half the time the game fails to connect to online services.

I tried everything-- my machine was in a DMZ at one point-- and I got nowhere. I had the same problems when the game came out, and there still were no fixes that I found. Really lame. The game's had 7 patches and it's the only game I have networking problems with-- I have less problems with old IPX games, and I have to install IPX whenever I play them and uninstall when I'm done!

This is obviously part rant, part plea for help, part begging for reassurance that Treyarch won't fuck up the networking in BO... 

**TL;DR**: WaW is a really fun game with-- apparently-- massive technical and user interaction issues. I spent 6 hours trying to get it to work, failed, and now I can't play WaW and I'm nervous about Black Ops.",technology,2010-11-02,-0.3452291281613029

politics,"Why, as a Republican, I voted for Democrats in this election.","Contrary to what many of you think of Republicans (And we have done a good job of letting you see us this way) we are not all Tea Party, Homophobic, anti-marijuana, pro-life, religious wingnuts.

It's unfortunate that we have let a minority destroy our image.

The following issues weighed very heavily on me.

I believe homosexual marriage should be legalized. I don't care about a persons sexual preference because it does not affect me. I believe if two people love each other they should be allowed the same ceremonial bond and legal acknowledgement and rights as an opposite sex couple.

You can bring your religion into this all you want, Christians, but the New Testament changed the rules of the game. The New Testament is about loving your neighbor, not denying them rights and stoning them to death like in the Old Testament.

As an Agnostic I guess it seems pretty simple to me.

I believe we need to raise taxes to cover the mistakes we have made over the past decade. I still believe we should try to avoid some of that using the slush funds remaining from TARP but that won't cover everything so we need to pay in the form of taxes.

I believe in a single-payer health care system because I believe that health care has become a human right. I don't like the current system President Obama has put in place through compromises but I do realize that the only way it will get better is to keep the current wingnut Republicans away from it.

I believe that marijuana is a safe drug. It may typically be recreational but it has medical value also. That does not mean I only support it's use medicinally. I support the use of marijuana by anyone as long as it does not endanger me or others.

I am pro-life (with a twist). For me, personally, I am against abortion but I can't make choices for other people until I've walked a mile in their shoes. I can't imagine it's an easy choice to make. I know, that sounds like pro-choice but I want serious regulation on it and I think education is the best way to avoid unwanted pregnancies. I just know enough people in certain crowds use it as a birth control method (I know some people personally that do this) and I think that needs to be dealt with. I just don't know how.

So how does that not make me a Democrat?

Well, I am against expanding hate crime laws. All crimes against individuals are hate crimes in my opinion. I don't feel we need extra laws to make a crime against a specific group any worse than they would be against a random stranger.

I don't think any of us should be required to purchase health insurance from a corporation that can raise rates, deny insurance or deny coverage at any point in your agreement with them (and yes, they have all found loopholes around the current laws).

I don't believe we should be allowing  the government to raise the debt limit another $1.9 trillion.

I don't think Federal tax money should be provided to organizations that promote abortions (or provide them).

I've said enough.

Edit: So apparently I am a plant (or this post is) for the Democrats. At least that is what the PMs from the Tea Party extremists I have been getting state.

I'll just say this...go over my posts for the last 2? years I've been on Reddit (gotta be close to that by now) and you will see that my opinion has changed in many areas and remained in others.

That would be an awesome 2 year ruse I pulled on the community.

As an additional note, these are clearly new users or trolls sending these PMs. I actually credit Reddit with some of my view changes (hope that wasn't karma whoring...this is a text post).

What's important is that we do the right things over the next two years to set us up for the big races to come.  Keep in mind at all times our key strength:  **In American politics it's not necessary to win.  We just need to come in next-to-last.**

At the federal level we just need to do more of the same.  We could get some concessions from Obama and the Dems, but screw that.  That's the consolation prize.  It's all about obstruction for us.  It worked yesterday and it will work in 2012.  People are going to vote based on their views of the economy and we want them dissatisfied in 2012.  To make that happen, the best thing we can do is keep Congress deadlocked. They'll take it out on Obama, not us.

At the federal level:

Health care - We don't want to do anything big here.  Rail against Obamacare in the media, but there's nothing to gain legislatively at this point.  Tell insurance companies to bide their time and get ready to spend money for us in 2012, and we'll get things done for them after that election.

Medicare - Restore the spending increases cut in the last session.  Then (This is great!) tell seniors that we saved them from a government takeover of their health care.

Climate change - Block any measures to deal with climate change.  Make sure the fossil fuel industries know we've got their backs so they'll be there in 2012 with their checkbooks open.

Unemployment - Block any extensions to unemployment insurance, claiming it's a deficit control measure.  We can also say it's to encourage people to get back to work.  Don't worry about ""disenfranchising"" voters.  Homeless people don't vote, but they scare the crap out of the middle class, and scared middle class voters will vote for us.

Let's not forget tax cuts for the rich.  They're not a drag on the budget, but rather an investment that will pay off at campaign time.

We have one big worry for 2012: We need a presidential candidate that will win over the Tea Party while still appealing to more moderate voters.  We've seen that our base will elect Sharon Angle/Christine O'Donnell types.  Be ready to counter that with lots of money in the primaries.  Also, anybody who mentions Sarah Palin gets punched in the throat.

At the state level, besides clever redistricting, we should work on the anti-immigrant angle.  That well is going to run dry eventually but not yet.  Mexican drug violence also helps us, so we need to do what we can to make it easy to buy guns that will eventually find their way south.  Also, cut back on drug rehab programs as much as possible.

Overall, the next two years are no-brainers for us, no pun intended.",finance,2010-11-03,0.0431554599282636

See the ""Property-tax exemption for disabled veterans"" is at around 75 to 25 percent.  Unfortunately, the voters didn't actually know what this measure entailed.

First of all, it means any veteran that has any service-related disability.  This term will probably be applied loosely in execution (but it is not written loosely) to many things including arthritis, bad back, and other ailments people generally receive during the aging process.

Second, property tax goes to local governments, not the federal government.

This ballot measure will basically create a significant revenue drop for local governments in a tough economy for federal soldiers.  The locals are footing the bill for the government's soldiers.

It's good that we as Americans are ready and willing to help our veterans out in tough times, but it's unfortunate that the local governments of Virginia are being made to suffer because of it.  If voters were more informed about the actual effects of the ballot measure, I'm sure it'd still pass, but by a slimmer margin.  Town councilpeople are going to be pissed.

politics,A thought experiment for Republicans,"Given the following:

1. There's broad agreement across the country that the federal government's levels of debt and spending are serious problems; this is universally accepted by conservatives. 

2. It's clear that no serious, long-term solution to this debt and spending problem can occur in the absence of entitlement reform, particularly Medicare and Social Security.

While the next Congress will have a power split, Republicans will control a solid majority in the House. Unlike in the Senate, a majority party in the House rules with an iron fist. Debate is limited, and there are no filibuster rules that allow a minority to control the agenda. With a 50%-plus-one majority, the Speaker of the House can bring a vote to the floor and force it through, using only members of his or her own party. For example in the current Congress, while the Senate was never able to act on energy policy reform, Pelosi was able to pass cap and trade legislation in the House. 

Here's the experiment I propose:
The Republicans lost a lot of fiscal credibility when they controlled Congress during the last decade. While I think it's unlikely that the entire Congress will pass legislation creating meaningful entitlement reform in the next two years, I can see no reason why the Republican majority in the House can't do so, if they're serious about solving the problem. 

To demonstrate that they're serious about spending reform, the Republican-controlled House should, in the next two-year session, pass legislation to reform both Medicare and Social Security. The test for their success is that the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office scores the bill as making Medicare and Social Security fiscally sound through at least 2050. 

My prediction - what you'll see instead is two years of political grandstanding, with no real attempt on the part of House Republicans to solve the problem they were elected to solve.",energy,2010-11-03,0.0077072453607899

politics,"The new senator of Idaho wants to repeal the 17th Amendment (popular election of senators). Here's why: original system vs the current system.  Our Founders were probably right on this one, guys.","The senator-elect of Idaho has [**repeatedly stated**](http://www.thenewamerican.com/index.php/usnews/constitution/3689-tea-party-wants-to-dump-17th-amendment) that he supports repealing the 17th Amendment, or the direct election of senators by the people, and instead return to the Founders' system of having them appointed by the state legislators.
 
The original system went like this:

* The People were represented by the House of Representatives,
    * The primary goal of the House was to pass laws that helped the people.
    * Its secondary goal was to stop laws that would hurt the People.
* The States were represented by the Senate
    * The primary goal of the Senate was to stop laws that would hurt the States, esp. in terms of their sovereignty, from passing.
    * Its secondary goal was to pass laws that would benefit the States.
* Senate campaigns
    * required *zero* donations from the public or corporations.  In fact, campaign contributions were considered bribery in the majority of states and outright outlawed.
    * involved *zero* public political advertisements, as the public was not involved at all (except telling their state reps who to vote for)
    * required unethical/illegal entities to bribe large swaths of a state's legislature to get a certain man appointed.
    * were much harder to ""fix"" because candidates largely were not known until just a few months before the election.
* Senators could be fired: States could ""recall"" their senators at will, even on the basis of a single vote not in the state's interest, and replaced at will, something that is impossible today.

The new system works like this:

* Senators serve on average 20+ years in office.
* Senators are beholden to no one, and it is virtually impossible to remove them unless they commit some gross illegal act.
* States are represented by no one.
* There is very little difference between a Senator and Representative, so legislation is passed far more often than is wise, leading to great expanse in Federal government.
* There are effectively zero checks on Federal usurpation of states' rights, except the nuclear option: secession.
* Senate campaigns
    * cost many millions of dollars on average
    * are paid in part by tax dollars
    * require donations from corporations and people
    * are far more easier to sway by ""electioneering"" (corporations paying for ads to bsaically brainwash people into voting a certain way)
    * are easily subverted: now you just have to buy off one guy per state (instead of potentially hundreds) and you know who he is years in advance.

politics,I'm going to come out and say it: Prop 19 didn't pass because it was shoddy.,"As a CA resident and some-time ent, I'm disappointed that prop 19 didn't pass. But I'm not surprised. The initiative was a hastily-constructed mishmash of three separate marijuana props that were all vying for space on the ballot last Spring, and suffered from a lack of direction, sponsorship, and PR.

I'm a former transit driver. As part of the federal regulations regarding my position, I was required to assent to random drug testing, as well as immediate post-accident testing should a major incident occur. Prop 19 would have made the random testing irrelevant re: MJ, as the initiative would have eliminated an employer's ability to take action against use outside and not affecting the workplace. Now, I'm not saying that MJ affects driving, and I don't approve of random drug tests. But my transit organization would have been unable to comply with federal safety standards as the result of CA law. I'd love to say ""fuck 'em"", but the company receives federal dollars to remain in service. Would the fed keep ponying up cash for an organization which openly flouts its safety standards? I'm not certain. Would out-of-state corporations accept bids from CA construction companies that can't pass federal OSHA inspections? I'm not certain. Yes, the rhetoric from the opposition was mostly bullshit ""MJ WILL EAT YOUR CHILDREN!"" garbage, but this is a valid economically-important point.

Even without the loophole, I think the initiative would have failed due to the complete lack of PR. There were no public faces for the bill; the governor, the president, both (major) senatorial candidates AND both gubernatorial candidates expressed opposition before and during the election. I heard radio and TV ads talking about the many (largely untrue) deleterious effects of the creepy reefer, but it was dead air on the other side. Primarily, the campaign was grass-roots word-of-mouth. That's cool in theory, but in practice we tend to discus matters with like-minded individuals, usually right after we pass the bong over. If we really cared, wouldn't we have organized an ad campaign? Door-to-door canvassing? Phone banking? We were the public face of the initiative, and it's not a friendly face to the family-values crowds in the Valley.

All of this would have been forgivable if we gave our all on election day. Normal voter turnout in CA elections is around 50%, with youth turnout hovering around 25%. We swung that around two years ago, energized by a black dude with a incredible smile. In 2008, under-30 voters comprised 20% of the voting population. Yesterday we were only 10%. Where did we all go?

I think our apathy and laziness got the better of us. I know people who genuinely had no idea the election was yesterday, they were all jazzed up to vote 'Yes on 19' this Saturday. Some of these people have advanced degrees in physics. They know the Higgs boson's middle name, but can't be bothered to google for election day.

TL;DR - I'm sad that I can't go to Safeway this afternoon to buy a joint, but I'm not surprised. It was a poorly thought-out bill (based on a GREAT idea) with a weak campaign. I take my solace with the knowledge that 45% (45%!!) of voters genuinely thought it would be a good idea to flagrantly disregard federal drug policy so we could smoke a bowl together.

FIRE OBAMA! The Clock Is Ticking!

The voters have spoken!
Obama's Presidency has been a living nightmare for our country. In two short years, Obama has single-handely destroyed our country. From the never-ending stimulus, to epidemic proportions of unemployment, the damage Obama has inflicted on our country is never-ending. Right now, America is at a critical crossroads. The action you take at this moment will determine if our country will survive these dismal times. We must act now to protect our family and our country, because you can bet Obama and his buddies could care less. The countdown to FIRE Obama begins NOW!

Repeal Obama's Bills &amp; Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
America has had enough. Now, more than ever, Obama must hear it directly from the people. We will no longer submit to his bullying tactics. We will no longer tolerate his arrogant disregard for us. And we will no longer let him get away with imploding our economy. IT'S TIME WE THE PEOPLE HOLD OBAMA ACCOUNTABLE.

If we ever want to have any hope for our future, we must work together to clean up Obama's trail of destruction-right now! I'm sure your thinking this will be an impossible feat to accomplish. After all, the damage Obama has inflicted on our country is tremendous.

I can't deny that cleaning up Obama's mess won't be tough. But, anything you love is worth fighting for. And I hope you love this country as much as I do. Together, we can battle to repeal each and every toxic bill Obama's passed. How will we do this? We will create an avalanche of groundswell support. We will flood the White House and Congress with a tsunami of faxes. We will let Obama and his buddies know we won't rest until all of Obama's bills are repealed. And we will keep reminding Obama his power trip will come to a screeching halt in 2012.

Interested? I hope so. The time is now, for each and every one of us to rise up and fight for what we love: America. You and I know Obama has trampled all over our beloved country. His serial taxing sprees, his addiction to stealing our money and his endless stimulus bills have done enormous damage to our economy. Obama's list of failures could span for miles. But the sake of time, let's begin with debt.

Obama has dumped more debt on our country than any other President in history. What does that mean for you? It means, just for existing- YOU OWE $43,000 IN DEBT! And thanks to Obama's unbridled spending binge, your children and their children's debt could be three times that amount. Even more enraging is: YOU haven't received anything in return for giving Obama a huge chunk of your paycheck. Does the government pay for the food on your table? Probabally not. But, Obama is paying the grocery bills for 41.8 million people. Your tax dollars are funding the greatest robbery in history.

Repeal Obama's Bills &amp; Send Him Back To Chicago

What does this massive amount of debt mean for our country? Since there is no way we can repay our debt we will either default on our loans or experience a cataclysmic inflation hike. If we default on our loans, our credit rating will plummet and everyone who owns treasury bonds will lose their savings. In addition, thousands of pension funds will be worthless, and tens of millions of Americans will have their savings wiped out. Better keep an eye on your bank account, because you could be next.

If inflation keeps heading towards the clouds, our money will be virtually worthless. That means we could experience Soviet-style food prices. I shudder when I imagine a fifty dollar price tag on a banana. If you think that's shocking, take a look some numbers.

Obama's Explosive Record of Debt

    * $26.2 Trillion: Estimated Debt in 2020
    * $13.6 Trillion: Current National Debt
    * $3 Trillion: Debt Obama Has Crushed America With Since Taking Office
    * $868.4 Billion: Debt America Owes To China
    * $831 Billion: Interest Payment On Debt In 2020
    * $1.23 Trillion: Debt In 2009 (The Highest Debt In History)

Pretty scary. But that's not all. Let's take a look at the collasal mess of ObamaCare. I'm sure you'll never forget how Obama and his cronies steamrolled this bogus bill into law. ObamaCare is just another example of the blantant disregard Obama has for each and every one of us.

Repeal Obama's Bills &amp; Send Him Back To Chicago
SEND FAXES TO ALL 100 CONGRESSMEN!
The aftershocks from ObamaCare are starting to shake our country. Private companies are planning on dropping their worker's insurance coverage to help them swallow the bloated price tag of ObamaCare. Health insurance companies are already dropping coverage like flies. Utah-based Intermountain Health Care won't insure healthy kids anymore. You can be sure other companies will follow suit.

ObamaCare: The Price Tag Will Make You Sick

    * $2.5 Trillion Dollars: The Price Of ObamaCare
    * $575 Billion Dollars: Dollars ObamaCare Will Steal From Medicare
    * 30: Number Of Waivers Obama Gave Companies So He Could Avoid Letting People Know ObamaCare Will Cause Them To Lose Their Healthcare
    * 80%: Percent Of Small Businesses That Will Have To Change Healthcare Plans To Pay For ObamaCare
    * $569.2 Billion Dollars: Number Of Secret Taxes In ObamaCare

And it's not just ObamaCare that's draining our wallets. Obama's never ending ""stimulus"" has left our country in ruins. We have mile long unemployment lines, record numbers of people who have stopped looking for work and and no end in sight for the Recession. Even with an $18 million dollar website, Obama and his friends can't make their harebrained idea to resussitate our economy work.

The Stimulus: A Sinkhole Of Filled With Your Money

    * 1.2 Million: The Number Of People Looking For Work
    * 6.1 Million: The Amount Of People Unemployed For Longer Than 27 Weeks
    * $18 Million: The Cost Of The Stimulus Website

It's no secret, we are living in scary times. It seems like ages ago when we had a sane President who helped our country prosper. Sadly, those days are over. Since Barack Hussien Obama's election, our government has been overtaken by gangsters. And we all know, Obama and his thugs don't plan on changing their ways anytime soon.

politics,"What the ""Red Tsunami"" Has Accomplished","The Tea-Partiers, Republicans, and Conservatives throughout America can rest assured, feeling that they have won a major victory today.  A halt will be put to Barrack Obama's oppressive regime of over-spending and unconstitutional legislation which is damning our country to a future of incomprehensible debt and enslavement to the federal government.

A new era of responsibility and true representation of the people is finally being realized.  Old forms of overt government control, too long subverting the public good will be discarded; what was originally intended for America: a Republic, of, by and for the people, will be restored.  The voice of our country's citizens will finally be heard.

But in the end, after all is said and done (perhaps after 2 years time) - this is what the expansive ""Red Tsunami"" has brought to this country: 

Nothing.

No definitive plan to help the economy in any comprehensible fashion.  
No way to reconcile spending cuts while also cutting taxes.  
No deviation from negative advertising to rile up the most base urges from the populace.  

No respect for political and social reality from the Democratic party.  
No shame from corporations funneling historic amounts of money into their self-chosen red candidates.  

No more water in Lake Mead; so we quench our thirst with political promises.

And No - I'm not a Democrat.  I'm a new father, in debt for getting an education, and heart-broken at how difficult it is to see this country getting any better.",finance,2010-11-03,0.0010987147934447

Even if it had passed we had yet to see what the federal government would have done with that.  Oh, and unless you live in Portugal or The Netherlands, it's illegal in your country too, so chill the fuck out with the lecture.

If you are from Canada, The streets of your largest city turned into a warzone this summer.  Your government is so in bed with ours that they extridited a man who had never done anything illegal on American soil to face 5 years in an American federal pen.  You've got some great, progressive leaning cities (so do we, btw), but your great white north is just as full of insano right wingers as our midwest.  It's not like you immediately turn liberal if you cross the border from Alaska to Yukon.  Oh, and you still recognize the Queen as your head of state.  And your football league is fucking ridiculous.

If you live in Britain, you just had the opportunity to set a shining example of progressivism for the world by electing a Lib Dem majority and making the brilliant Nick Clegg your next prime minister.  Instead, you moved from left to right and gave parliament back to the conservatives.  Oh yeah, you also gave them a larger majority than Tony Blair's Labour party ever had.  You also have failed to take a serious role in the European economy by resisting converting to the Euro.  You're still clinging to your glory days of empire in the Falklands and Northern Ireland, and you share responsibility for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.  You still have troops engaged there.

The rest of Europe is suffering from Islamiphobia, just like we are.  There are right of center parties in control of several major European governments.  No one except for Turkey (which has its own boatload of social problems is doing a damn thing about Israel's actions in Gaza and the West Bank.  No one is stepping up to become a major world power the way that the US did after WW2.  

So before you start a new thread calling Americans retards or idiots or whatever else you've thrown around, take a look at your own government, your own social problems, and your own failures to move in a progressive direction before you take your frustrations out on us.

1.  T  F   The Constitution of the United States of America was ratified on July 4, 1776.

2.  T  F   Neither Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, nor George Washington considered themselves Christian.

3.  T  F   The Emancipation Proclamation made illegal the institution of slavery in the United States.

4.  T  F   The theory of biological evolution makes no claim about the origin of life on Earth.

5.  T  F   The President is not able to submit bills directly to Congress.

6.  T  F   The government's deficit is the amount of money currently owed by the government.

7.  T  F   The United States is a democratic republic, not a democracy.

8.  T  F   Ben Franklin invented electricity.

9.  T  F   The Constitution does not contain the phrase ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.""

10.  T  F   The members of some religions should be prohibited from voting.

Answers:

1. False.  This is the date of the signing of the Declaration of Independence.  The Constitution was ratified June 21, 1788, a full 12 years afterward.

2. True.  Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and George Washington considered themselves Deists.  Deists reject the idea that Jesus was anything but human.

3. False.  The Emancipation Proclamation applied to the Confederate States of America, a foreign nation at the time, and had no bearing on slaves in the United States of America.  The Fourteenth Amendment ended slavery in the US.

4. True.  The theory of biological evolution only describes how species change over time, not how life first came about.

5. True.  The President is prohibited from directly submitting bills to Congress.

6. False.  The deficit is the difference between the government's revenue and expenditures.  The debt is the amount of money currently owed.

7. True.  The United States is a democratic republic that elects representatives.  In a true democracy, citizens vote on laws themselves.

8.  False.  Not only was electricity in existence long before Ben Franklin was born, but Ben Franklin was not the first human to discover electrical energy.

9.  True.  This phrase is found in the Declaration of Independence but not in the Constitution.

10.  False.  Anyone who chooses ""true"" would be in violation of a number of civil rights protections and their bigotry is grounds for ignoring their vote.

politics,"Thinking about starting a new political party.  Disaffected Dems, Progressives, fed-up Republicans, take a look.","The situation is this:  the Democratic Party, the people I have voted for in every election since I was old enough to vote, have become ineffectual in the face of the ever more powerful, influential and insane extreme right-wing forces in this country.  As much as I admire certain individuals in the Democratic Party, on the whole they cannot hold together and form a cohesive ideological front.  The Party as it is today is so afraid of losing votes that it drifts to the center and right at the drop of a hat, and is unable to sell its ideas and solutions to their constituents.

Making things worse is the fact that both parties have been largely, if not wholly subsumed by corporate interests.  There are dwindling few--if there are truly any--politicians not on somebody's payroll, and the most powerful corporations are the ones exerting their influence on legislation and policy:  oil companies, media conglomerates and the like, whose desire for profit above all is antithetical to the interests of the common person.

What I'm suggesting is a clean break with the Democratic Party, a true grassroots effort, unlike the astroturfing that went on with the Tea Party*.  A new political party, built from the ground up, without the baggage of the Old Left, determined to do things right this time around.

I'm not a political strategist or an expert in any way, I'm just a guy and occasional activist who follows politics, and wants a better world to live in.  I realize that below I'm going to suggest a few things which may sound naïve or highly improbable, especially in the context of today's political environment; but that's why I'm posting--I want to refine these ideas and make them better.  I want the help of people who are way smarter than I am to make helpful suggestions.  It would be absolutely fantastic if we could help this angry little seed of an idea grow into a mighty tree of...uh...awesomeness.

*  Funding for the Party is a tricky thing.  I'm not sure how to go about asking for money from those who have it without cutting deals and making promises, thus becoming beholden to corporations and special interests.  But if it CAN be done, that can be a selling point--the Party's distaste for corporate meddling.  Perhaps there's a way to limit contributions and cast a wide net, looking for money without so many strings attached.  I'm well aware that this is an ""Underwear Gnomes"" bullet point (...""step 3, PROFIT!"") but there has to be a way to do this that hasn't been figured out yet.

*  In terms of policy, our chief selling point shouldn't be that we belong on the axis of ""big"" versus ""small"" government; which is a false dichotomy crudely bolted onto the argument by those who want to muddy the waters.  We are for a government who runs things *well.*  We are for *efficient* government that determines the needs of its constituents and responds accordingly, which are continually in flux--like an engine that can look inward and adjust or re-tool itself as needs be.  The problem with this bullet point is complexity.  This would have been a great political tactic a hundred years ago, whereas now there are layers of complexity to the process of running the country that it seems unwieldy and inefficient.  Yes, it's the best system we have, but most people agree that, at certain fundamental levels, it's broken.  And if there's one thing any engineer will tell you, *if your system's broken, you figure out a better way and use that instead.*  There is such a thing as entropy.  Broken systems don't miraculously fix themselves, as a matter of fact, they tend to get worse.  You think things are bad now--imagine how they'll be in 50 years if nothing gets overhauled.  We'll long for the days of wacky Teabaggers and Sanity Rallies.

*  If you have to place this nascent Party on a left-right scale, it will inevitably wind up somewhere left of the Democrats' current position, simply because of its position on traditionally leftist issues--I would not be a part of any political party that didn't have civil rights and civil liberties at its core.  The stuff that the Democrats usually fail at attempting to deliver will be our payload, and I would refuse to shy away from things like protecting the environment, financial reforms, preserving a woman's right to choose, LGBT rights and so on and so forth.  But perhaps our main front will have to be one of Constitutionality.  Defending and upholding the Constitution is not, and should not, be the claimed domain of right-wing nuts.  The Bill of Rights works both ways--they're the rights of every single American; and by allowing the right to co-opt the Constitution as their sacred parchment, the left has been stripped of the ability to lay down the law.  Let's change that.  Let's use what the Founding Fathers gave us to defend ourselves and our ideology.  Remember, George W. Bush once claimed that the Constitution was ""just a damned piece of paper.""**  Let's show that we can do better than that.

I know that I'm holding myself up to ridicule and downvotes by suggesting all this, without holding a degree in political science or having more concrete ideas.  Again, though, I want to build something around this bare-bones concept, and I'm hoping that at least a few of you will lend a hand.

As for what to call the Party, well, let's look at some words we could use.  ""Liberal"" is such a loaded term, though of course that's not by design; it's been turned into such a slur over the last twenty years by people who think compassion, intelligence and thoughtfulness have no place in politics.  I proudly call myself a Progressive.  I feel that the term has weight and authority and a simple narrative; in that I want the world to progress and improve, moving into a better future instead of regressing into the mire and backwardness of the past (which is why I sometimes call Republicans ""Regressives"").  But the ""Progressive Party"" seems a bit too on the nose.  Plus, it's been done.

My thought is this:  let's use a word that just doesn't appear in politics anymore, because people have forgotten it exists.  It means both righteousness and fairness, an even-handed and high-minded approach to all things.

I say we call it the Justice Party.

politics,Barack Obama and what he's done for the country thus far,"It is unfortunate that we as Americans are having a hard time seeing all the good Obama has done for the country. Is it because he is black or what is it? Here some of the things he has done since he came into office, with no help from the opposite party whatsoever.

 

 He has passed historic health-care reform, which not only sees that 32 million Americans (including myself) get coverage, it also sees that insurance companies can't deny me coverage because I have a pre-existing condition. Good luck getting treatment it you're already sick, because insurance companies sure won't pay for it. Now, they have to. Also, we have free healthcare until we turn 26! We work right off of our parent's plans, which means you and I can go to the doctor without having to worry about the pocketbook-hit. Also, note that this hardly a socialist bill, in fact it is extremely capitalist. How American is universal health-care that runs through insurance corporations? Not to mention that the bill is deficit-positive.

 

He passed a giant economic stimulus act that nearly single-handedly saved the economy from going under. It's not perfect now, but the economy has grown the past NINE quarters. That means the economy has gotten better gradually over the last two years, with not a single dip since the stimulus was passed. Jobs have finally stopped being lost since april of this year, and every month since then we have actually gained jobs! That hasn't happened since 2007. It put money into the hands of people who truly needed it, and it has put money into the fields of technology that we really need to invest in. If we are to grow and innovate new technologies, how will we compete globally? You cannot expect us to run off of oil forever, and this stimulus gave nearly 100 billion to the fields of green, clean energy technology. The only way to get off of our oil addiction is to find something else that runs our cars. While I'm on energy, Obama has increased the minimum mp/g to 40 in the next year, and 50 and then 60 within the next three and five years! This will force american car companies to work on new technologies that will make sure we can afford to drive and that we eventually get the oil monkey off of our back.

 

He's cut taxes on everyone making less than 150,000 dollars a year, and all small businesses bringing in less than 250,000 dollars a year! This helps out the middle class SIGNIFICANTLY. The middle class probably wouldn't have made it through this crisis without these income tax breaks, they were absolutely crucial. Note that the only taxes he ""raised"" were those making over 250,000 dollars, and that was only because the Bush tax cuts expired! He has only lowered taxes for everyone that truly needs the relief in this time of economic instability.

 

He has also passed historic wall-street reform. Ensuring that these banks never ever get bailed out by taxpayers again, banning under-the-table sales of derivatives (the main cause of the housing crisis) and further regulations that make sure that the wall-street execs can't further rob the middle class. It is the biggest financial reform in history, and it does a good job to ensure that the 2008 fallout doesn't repeat itself.  Note that the republicans were vehemently against everything in this bill, and offered no solutions to the crisis. It's almost as if they are the puppy dogs of the bankers...almost.

 

He has reformed education, in that now I no longer have to go through banks to get student loans, I can get my school money straight from the federal government. Also, if I can't manage to pay them all off by the time I'm forty, then I will be absolved of them all! 200 billion dollars of the stimulus money went to our public schools, who badly need the funding. Half of the schools in our country can't even afford enough teachers for our students, or even updated books! We still have science books that were written in the 70s!

 

He ended the war in Iraq! We have finally washed our hands of that unnecessary, bloody, extremely financial-draining war that hardly had a point in the first place. It is awesome to finally be able to say we have ended our combat operations there, and this will save BILLIONS compared to what the spending was under Bush. This is not to say however, that he has given up on the war on terrorism, because he has actually increased the troop level in Afghanistan by 30,000! If you've forgotten then Afghanistan was actually the country that was harboring Al Queda and Bin Laden, NOT Iraq. He's also made the executive order to close Guantanamo Bay, a place where we torture other war criminals with no trials and no respect for the Geneva Convention. Obama didn't want American troops to be treated in the same fashion, unfortunately this was not passed by congress, thanks to the many republican votes against it.

 

He's signed a nuclear arms treaty with Russia that actually reduces the amount of nuclear weapons in the world! By 2047 Russia and the United States plan on dismantling over 300 nuclear weapons that have the capacity to wipe out the entire human race. Obama may have saved humanity with this treaty, who can know?

 

He's done so many positive things for the country, and despite what the media and people have been saying he's been a great president thus far. Let's give the man a chance (I know it's hard, he's black :V) before we jump ship! It's truly unfortunate that we've went right back to the guys we just voted out of office when so much good is being done. He's not a socialist, a Muslim or a Kenyan, he's the first African-American president and he has done everything he promised he would do.

Economics,The worry and dread I feel about the corruption in economy today is boundless.,"I am a Canadian freelance writer, marketer, and silver investor. I have taken refuge in food storage and precious metals as my one and only means of protecting my wealth in a now blackened society. I may not hail from the United States. But when the giant falls, the earth will tremble. And whom is closest to that giant's tremor? We, the Canadians.

The corruption in society today never fails to out stand me. Everything is in the Twilight Zone. Civil servants now dominate the people. Lawyers and judges eradicate justice. Financial systems destroy wealth. The media suppresses information. The government destroys the voice of the people. And it's as if it was all done be design.

When I discovered the fraudulent nature of the Federal Reserve a few years ago, I had expected it to eventually do the United States in sooner or later.

With a mounting national debt turned into a shell game and quantitative easing/further fiat currency abuse imminent, never would I have imagined the writing on the wall to have been inked out so soon. I thought the financiers who conceived it would have been a lot more subtle. But now that collapse I had anticipated seems quite imminent.

We live in a time of apathy of our fellow human being. Rampant financial fraud. Absolute systematic corruption of government, and what appears to be a societal breakdown. Right beneath the nose of the average citizen, they are being robbed of everything they've labored for. The founding fathers of the United States have specifically warned us what would happen if we let a central bank dominate the US financial system. They warned us what would happen if the money supply was cornered by avaricious elitist financiers.

Downvote me into oblivion if you must. I thought it was only fair to step up and express my concern for my neighbors down south. If only the US Citizen was angry enough to claim their government back and to abolish their privatized central bank. But I fear that in attempt to create such a rally that we may choose instead to fight amongst ourselves, oblivious that our real enemies are the sociopathic financiers that comprise only a small portion of human population today and engineered these crises.",finance,2010-11-05,-0.2838121486988266

* Basically, how does the U.S. avoid inflation if it keeps printing money (QE2?) Is it just that the U.S.'s economy is so huge that QE2 doesn't really affect it?  
* What does it mean that China 'buys U.S. debt?' Is China just buying into the U.S. dollar and converting it to Yuan, thereby keeping RMB devalued while keeping the money supply in the US low to avoid inflation?
* What happens if China stops 'buying U.S. debt?' If what I said in question two is true, does that mean if China stops buying into the USD the Yuan will suddenly gain a bunch of value and the US economy will experience huge inflation, effectively creating a 'perfect storm'? 

Thanks!

Economics,Honest question from someone inexperienced in economics: What negative effects would failure to raise the debt ceiling have that continued increase of the debt would not have?,"There is some talk now that certain Republicans may refuse to raise the debt ceiling, or refuse to raise the debt ceiling except under certain conditions. I know beyond any doubt this is a lie. However, let's assume it's true.

What is the impact of doing this? The federal government defaults?

What is the impact of not doing this? The federal government ... defaults later?

Is the argument for raising the debt ceiling that somehow the debt will begin to shrink at some point in the future? If so, [the numbers don't look good](http://zfacts.com/metaPage/lib/Brill-nom-US-national-debt.gif). If not, what? I honestly don't understand.

As far as I can tell, the federal government is pushing a bubble economy based on debt that is unpayable. There will have to be a correction for that at some point, either in the form of prolonged periods (a decade or more) of double-digit inflation and double-digit interest rates, or outright (military-backed) default. If that correction comes sooner rather than later, who is worse off?

What part of this equation am I missing? What is gained by delaying the default on the federal debt? If the default is preventable, how? Is there any meaningful, serious expectation that at some point in the future, if we just avoid defaulting now, Washington will wise up and start slashing spending by the 50% or more it would need to in order to begin to pay down the debt?",finance,2010-11-05,-0.2603354594893991

It would be tough to predict with any accuracy how long the USD will continue to be the world's reserve currency, so I'll leave that alone for now, but I think the case can still be made that the USD has nowhere to go but down.  

Hopefully it will remain stable compared to the currencies of other developed nations, but when you think about the dollar compared to the yuan, the rupee, the ruble and the Brazilian real, is there anywhere for the dollar to go but down, and won't this affect the dollar's overall value?  We had a good 20 year run as the world's only superpower, and I think the USD's value benefited from that situation, but I don't know how the dollar could maintain value as these other countries gradually gain a higher percentage of world GDP (short of irresponsibly tight monetary policy).

I mean, sure, the savers who have done everything right and don't see this coming will get hurt in real terms, but I'm not sure if the Fed deserves all or even most of the blame.  Instead of complaining, why don't capable savers do their homework and put their savings in something that is more likely to retain value?

politics,"I give up, I'm becoming a Republican","So, although i'm only 20 years old i would like to think i'm pretty educated about politics. Read the wallstreet journal every day, listen to fresh air every time it political and listen to it's all politics and slate's gabfest every week.
Although i agree with the democrats on almost every single issue, i give up trying to defend them in everyday life, the internet, and every where else. It seems like reason has lost to hype and talking points. Maybe politics was never very much about reason, but it seems like i would rather be on the side of politics where people listen, then were i'm right, but completely ignored and yelled at. The ways the Republicans push their points is so brilliant. All on message and if you get off message you get kicked hard enough to fall back into message. Why would you want to go against that system. The Democratic politicians seem to be split in two groups. Either they are so happy they are in office and want to stay there, that they become prolife, pro gun, pro i want to keep my job so lets not make any republicans angry. The other group is so invested in it's own talking points that they have no unified message. I just listened to this american life from last week. The second story was probably the tipping point for this decision. http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/417/this-party-sucks. It basically explains why the democrats have failed so badly at coming back at republican talking points. There is no unified message. The democratic insider said it so beautifully: my shit is better then their shit, so when they send me talking points, i delete them, because my talking points are better. 
So here are my new talking points that will make my life a lot easier.

*even though obama might not be a Muslim, he is definitely a Muslim sympathizer. He cares more about what the Muslim world thinks than what the American People think of him. This is very easy to sell

*Even though the banks are in the process of paying back or have already payed back most of the bailout, tax money was put into the system to bail out companies. Money the US can't afford at the moment. The federal reserve still own thousands of houses. According to Planet Money, it is one of the largest real estate holders in the US. This should never happen, spending billions of dollars on bailing out banks, that we can't afford.

*The amount of effort made to create jobs is laughable. Spending money to create short term jobs for unskilled labor, which will probably be useless in 5 years anyway (the way Americans build roads is laughable and a waist of time and money but for a different discussion). This is more money that is waisted.

*Lets make America independent again. Currently the USA owes China 900 billion dollars. pay back the debt and pay for it by increasing taxes on imports. No one is going to complain that items not made in the USA are more expensive. Create the message, we want our companies to come back to the USA. We will give you tax breaks here, so come back and start producing products in the US again. 

*Give gays civil unions. People take the sanctity of marriage seriously, so please don't try to redefine it to something other than man and woman. I understand that gays want the same legal rights as heterosexuals, but that does not mean a hundreds of years long tradition had to be overthrown. I know there is still a lot of homophobia in this country which i am not a part of, but I don't think talking about what marriage means should be talked about right now. Just consider them equal under the law, by passing a law that gays can participate in civil unions which will give them the same legal rights, but doesn't upset anyone. 

I know I don't post here often, but I just felt like maybe you guys could understand where i'm coming from. Maybe you can convince me that the facts are more important that having easy talking points, but atm i don't see a reason to put up with the effort of trying to defend facts, while there are easy talking points to talk about out there and and a whole army of people that will join me in those talking points. 

In Summary: I""m sick of arguing facts in politics, which no one listens to, while I could be making arguments that everyone else is making and no one argues with. I can put up with being called stupid and ignorant by a small minority of people.",finance,2010-11-06,-0.0324991744430535

*Exclude from income*

* $33,000 - In 2010, the spouses can each contribute $16,500 to a 401(k) retirement plan.  These amounts are not considered income in 2010; they will be considered income when the money is taken out.

* $10,000 - Assuming each spouse's employer contributes $5,000 to his and her 401(k) plan.  Again, this money will be subject to income tax when the money is withdrawn.

* $5,000 - The amount that I have assumed an employer may pay towards an employee's health insurance premium.  I have assumed that one of the spouses takes family coverage, which covers the other spouse and the kids.  Most people don't consider this income because they never see the cash, but the employer gets to deduct these payments from its income for income tax purposes.

* $5,000 - If the spouses have a [Flexible Spending Account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_spending_account) or a [Health Savings Account](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Health_savings_account) to cover health expenses, they amount they contribute to that account in 2010 is not considered income.  I have assumed $5,000 here.

This leaves an income of **$247,000.**

*Deduct from income*

* $14,600 - Personal exemptions of $3,650 for each spouse and each kid.

* $15,000 - Deduction for state income tax (varies by state - may be higher or lower)

* $40,000 - Deduction for the amount of interest paid on home mortgages (I have assumed the couple owns a vacation home in addition to their primary home, and has mortgages on both).

* $10,000 - Deduction for state real estate taxes on both homes (varies by state - may be higher or lower).

* $12,000 - Deduction for charitable contributions.

This leaves an income of **$155,400**.  This is the amount that is taxable.

*Tax*

* With a taxable income of $155,400, a married couple filing a joint return is in the **28%** tax bracket.

* Their income tax payment is:  **$31,756**.  I'll round to **$32,000** to cover any Alternative Minimum Tax that this couple may have to pay.  

* A $32,000 tax is **10.67%** of their original income of $300,000.

*Notes*

* This covers only the couple's federal income tax, and does not include the amount of Social Security or Medicare taxes they pay.

* This assumes none of the income comes from capital gains.  Income from capital gains is subject to less tax that income from salary and wages.

* If the **Bush tax cuts** were to expire completely in 2011, this couple would be in the 36% tax bracket.  Their income tax (assuming no other changes except the tax rate) would be $39,295, or 13.1% of the original 300,000 in income.",finance,2010-11-07,-0.02936535733974

politics,So I had an idea of how reddit can influence politics on a large scale.,"I was reading the reddit thread I linked in which there was a discussion of creating a Political Action Committee funded by the reddit community. The idea basically being a group not devoted to a party or a politician but to good policy.

So, reddit, my idea is simply that we have a good long discussion on what we consider to be sensible policy until we have come to some sort of consensus. Then we write this up in the form of a list. Such as:

We support:

* An end to the unconstitutional ban on gay marriage,

* Ending don't ask don't tell.

* A reform of drug policy and an end to the prohibition of marijuana

* No intelligent design or equivalent religious 'theories' being taught in science rooms.

Then we upload this list to the internet in the form of a petition. It won't be a traditional ""If we get 100,000 people to sign this will you do it?"" petition. Merely a set of ideals. If you agree with this set of ideals and you will choose to vote in federal elections based on whether or not a candidate represents these ideals then you sign the petition.

Then when this petition gets signed by enough people it can be used to demonstrate to candidates how many people believe in these ideals, and how many votes there are to be gained from these views.

The problem with politics in the world as I see it is that there are plenty of reasonable people without a voice. But we don't need individual voices: there are 6 fucking billion of us. What we need is a pure and accurate statistical representation of how many of us there are, and how many of us vote.",technology,2010-11-09,-0.0035354978677723

politics,A real libertarian solution to preventing oil spills...,"* Remove government imposed liability caps.

[In a Truly Free Market, BP Would Be Toast](http://c4ss.org/content/2685)


&gt;""Without a government-imposed liability cap, BP would be liable to the full value of its assets not only for cleanup costs, but for the full amount of economic damages resulting from the Deepwater Horizon disaster.   Estimates of damage to tourism and fishing center on around $5 billion, but it could be far worse if the slick spreads far enough to affect fishing and boating for Florida’s $65 billion tourism industry (just think of the Everglades).  Keep in mind, also, that we’re not just talking about one-off costs this year; we’re talking about big hits to fishing and tourism for years to come, especially as the movement of toxic chemicals up the food chain may make Gulf seafood inedible for generations.  This is not just a one-year loss of income from 130,000 fishing jobs, but possibly an end to these people’s careers.  There are also possible indirect effects if the loss of wetlands increases coastal areas’ vulnerability to hurricanes.

&gt;And that’s not even taking into account the possibility of criminal negligence by BP executives — who  apparently rivaled Massey Energy’s Don Blankenship in cutting corners for just about every conceivable kind of safety measure — and the cleaning out of their personal assets by angry juries.

&gt;And remember, we’re talking about liability in addition to cleanup costs, which were $3.8 billion for the less severe Exxon Valdez spill.

&gt;These cumulative damages stack up pretty tall against BP’s total equity, which was around a hundred billion (at least before its stock took a hit the last month or so).

&gt;So absent a liability cap, as the flood of individual and class action lawsuits ate up the company’s equity, the market pressure for holding robust liability insurance (for damages up to tens of billions of dollars) would be a well-nigh non-negotiable prerequisite for economic viability in the industry.

&gt;And let’s face it.  After what happened with BP, in a legal regime with no limits to liability short of total liquidation of a corporation’s assets, insurers will have a pretty significant interest in making sure policy-holders don’t bankrupt them.

&gt;What passed for federal regulations were ineffectual because, among other things, it’s not the federal government’s own money that’s at risk.  Things get downright chummy between regulators and regulated.  Inspectors sleeping with executives and snorting crystal meth off of toaster ovens is what you call a “public-private partnership,” I guess.

&gt;I mean, seriously.  When Congress and the White House are packed with people who all got millions of dollars in campaign contributions from all sorts of regulated industries, and most of the political appointees in regulatory bodies are former directors and vice presidents of corporations in the regulated industries, how tough do you think that regulation’s gonna be?  Last I heard, brown pelicans don’t contribute much to campaign funds.

&gt;But if relations between regulators and regulated aren’t really all that adversarial, you know what is  adversarial?  Relations between insurers and the insured.  Insurance companies are notorious for not liking to pay claims, and for taking an adversarial view of policyholders who make them.  Especially when slipshod safety measures mean a multi-billion dollar payout from the insurance company’s own funds.   And the “adversarial” relationship is likely to entail things like actual inspections to make sure the failsafe devices work, maybe requiring relief wells as a standard precaution, things like that.

&gt;Insurance companies take the kind of adversarial attitude toward the insured that liberals only wish government regulators took toward regulated industries.""",finance,2010-11-09,-0.35860799534294

politics,"In all sincerity, please help me understand what is so threatening about the Health Care Reform Bill.","So I have been researching the facts in order to detect what it is Republicans and conservatives are so up in arms about. I really think I'm missing something here and I want *someone* to help me understand why repealing this law is so important to the Republicans in the House and in my home State of Georgia who now represent me. 

Is it because: 
 
* **It will using tax payer money for abortion?** Politically, conservatives seem to thrive on opposing abortion rights. But the bill has no provision for public funds being used this way. 

* **It will increase the deficit?** The estimates I've read (one according to CBS) are that it will ""reduce the deficit by $143 billion over the first ten years. The first preliminary estimate said it would reduce the deficit by $130 billion over ten years. Would reduce the deficit by $1.2 trillion dollars in the second ten years.""

* **It will insure illegal immigrants?** No. That's actually not a provision on the new bill at all. Let's move on.

* **It will increase everybody's taxes?** Medicare is to extend to unearned income (dividends, interest, stocks etc.) and will be a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for families making more than $250,000 per year. So for Americans making less than $250K this makes no difference and it is not at all a tax on wages. Hmmm ok... 

* **We're all mandated to get health insurance** Ok I can see where people can have a problem here. However, if you work for a company with 50+ employees your company will be penalized per worker that receives federal subsidies. I guess the problem is if you're an individual and don't select either a private or subsidized public option on your own and assuming your company is smaller than 50 employees, you could pay $695 a year. But this still doesn't seem like reason enough to repeal a law. 

So what is it? It this just the political ""Us vs. Them"" being played out again between Republicans and Democrats? If so, this seems like a lot of trouble just to stomp out a Democratically led bill as a matter of principle. If there's some truly American and constitutional reason to repeal this law I'm not seeing that makes sense, please help me understand what it is. 

Thank you!

Reagan did nothing but reduce capital requirements on banks, which produced the illusion of a boom economy and increased lending capital, but ultimately caused the Savings and Loan crisis in the late 1980's, at a cost of a $160 Billion bailout, courtesy of George Herbert Walker Bush.

Also, see the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act of 1982, which included a provision, Title VIII, that enabled lenders for the first time to issue adjustable-rate mortgages and other exotic loans, such as those requiring interest-only payments.

Reagan set the table for collapse by setting the precedent of employing reckless economic policy.

Republicans today are no different.

edit: Mr. Volcker left his chairmanship willingly in 1987. I had previously stated incorrectly that he had been fired. You can bet your ass nobody interested in deregulation liked him, though. Which, assuming the environment, probably helped the decision.",finance,2010-11-09,-0.0916279744339573

I paid my way through college and despite working 30 hour weeks at a bank, I still used a credit card to fund a significant amount of books, bills, and food.  I bought a house this June, but I don't yet have sufficient equity to borrow against the house.  Thanks to the tax credit that I got when I bout the house, I have about $4,000 sitting in an emergency fund and I put the rest toward debt.  After that paydown, I have just under $11,000 on one card at 15.25% APR.  American Express has declined to lower the rate.  I no longer make purchases on credit cards that can't be paid before the end of the month.  I'm paying more than the minimum payment, but there's still a significant amount of interest being charged.

I want to find an appropriate installment loan (open to suggestions) that will let me lower the interest rate on my debt.  I would love to pay it down using the $4k, but I'm too afraid of not having an emergency fund in case the cards aren't available when I need cash (home repair, fire, medical, lost job, etc.). I want to avoid balance transfers and teaser rates because they usually involve fees and steep rate increases after the promotional period.

I want to get r/personalfinance's advice before I start making applications because I don't want to have too many inquiries on my credit so shortly after buying my house.  I have considered traditional installment loans and peer-to-peer lending (like prosper.com), but I'm afraid that the amount will be too high or have too high an APR to be worthwhile.  I just want to make more of my payment go to principal reduction!

Any advice you can offer would be great including specific institutions or general strategies for approaching this amount.  Thanks.",finance,2010-11-12,-0.1174025618836474

Economics,"my unpopular opinion: the Fed's QE intervention was correct and prudent. The role of the Fed is to prevent domestic deflation and ensure maximum employment, not to support German, Brazilian or Chinese exports and Wall Street dollar-hoarders.","I know the Federal Reserve is unpopular on Reddit, and that the consensus on here is against its recent $600b intervention in the bond markets.  But I think that the Fed acted correctly and prudently, and if anything the QE should have been closer to $1 trillion  and that the dollar should be explicitly talked down until it devalues 25%. Such actions would greatly stimulate the US economy and avoid the deflationary cycle that derailed Japan for over a decade.

The Fed belongs to the American people, not to foreign central bankers: criticism from Germany is irrelevant: it's not the US Fed's job to protect your trade surplus, and Germany doesn't even have its own currency,  the Greek Euro too is not American's fault or problem.  Criticism from China is laughable: China is the worst manipulator of currency with zero credibility in the market.  Criticism for Americans on reddit is just incomprehensibly self-defeating and seems based more on ideology than math or even reason.  

It's time the American government, including the Federal Reserve system, put the interests of American people ahead of those of foreign central banks and Wall Street debt merchants.

politics,The truth about Sarah Palin.,"By Dewie Whetsell,  Alaskan Fisherman. 
As posted in comments on Greta's article referencing the MOVEON ad about Sarah Palin.
 
The last 45 of my 66 years I've spent in a commercial fishing town in Alaska .  I understand Alaska politics but never understood national politics well until this last year.  Here's the breaking point: Neither side of the Palin controversy gets it.  It's not about persona, style, rhetoric, it's about doing things.  Even Palin supporters never mention the things that I'm about to mention here.
 
1. Democrats forget when Palin was the Darling of the Democrats, because as soon as Palin took the Governor's office away from a fellow Republican and tough SOB, Frank Murkowski, she tore into the Republican's ""Corrupt Bastards Club"" (CBC) and sent them packing. Many of them are now residing in State housing and wearing orange jump suits The Democrats reacted by skipping around the yard, throwing confetti and singing, ""la"" (well, you know how they are). Name another governor in this country that has ever done anything similar. 

2. Now with the CBC gone, there were fewer Alaskan politicians to protect the huge, giant oil companies here. So she constructed and enacted a new system of splitting the oil profits called ""ACES."" Exxon (the biggest corporation in the world) protested and Sarah told them, ""don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out."" They stayed, and Alaska residents went from being merely wealthy to being filthy rich. Of course, the other huge international oil companies meekly fell in line. Again, give me the name of any other governor in the country that has done anything similar.

3. The other thing she did when she walked into the governor's office is she got the list of State requests for federal funding for projects, known as ""pork."" She went through the list, took 85% of them and placed them in the ""when-hell-freezes-over"" stack. She let locals know that if we need something built, we'll pay for it ourselves. Maybe she figured she could use the money she got from selling the previous governor's jet because it was extravagant.
 Maybe she could use the money she saved by dismissing the governor's cook (remarking that she could cook for her own family), giving back the State vehicle issued to her, maintaining that she already had a car, and dismissing her State provided security force (never mentioning - I imagine - that she's packing heat herself). I'm still waiting to hear the names of those other governors.

4. Now, even with her much-ridiculed ""gosh and golly"" mannerism, she also managed to put together a totally new approach to getting a natural gas pipeline built which will be the biggest private construction project in the history of North America. No one else could do it although they tried. If that doesn't impress you, then you're trying too hard to be unimpressed while watching her do things like this while baking up a batch of brownies with her other hand.
 
5. For 30 years, Exxon held a lease to do exploratory drilling at a place called Point Thompson. They made excuses the entire time why they couldn't start drilling. In truth they were holding it like an investment. No governor for 30 years could make them get started. Then, she told them she was revoking their lease and kicking them out. They protested and threatened court action. She shrugged and reminded them that she knew the way to the court house.  Alaska won again.
 
6. President Obama wants the nation to be on 25% renewable resources for electricity by 2025. Sarah went to the legislature and submitted her plan for Alaska to be at 50% renewable by 2025. We are already at 25%. I can give you more specifics about things done, as opposed to style and persona. Everybody wants to be cool, sound cool, look cool. But that's just a cover-up. I'm still waiting to hear from liberals the names of other governors who can match what mine has done in two and a half years. I won't be holding my breath.
 
By the way, she was content to return to AK after the national election and go to work, but the haters wouldn't let her. Now these adolescent screechers are obviously not scuba divers. And no one ever told them what happens when you continually jab and pester a barracuda. Without warning, it will spin around and tear your face off. Shoulda known better.

You have just read the truth about Sarah Palin that sends the media, along with the democrat party, into a wild uncontrolled frenzy to discredit her. I guess they are only interested in skirt chasers, dishonesty, immoral people, liars, womanizers, murderers, and bitter ex-presidents' wives.
 
So ""You go, Girl."" I only wish the men in Washington had your guts, determination, honesty, and morals.     
I rest my case. Only FOOLS listen to the biased media.

question on the great depression for me?","I have read a lot about the great depression, mainly from Austrian economic proponents but I am still puzzled on what caused it. From what I understand the FED created a huge stock market bubble by expanding the money supply through the 1920's. This burst in 1929, and the FED raised rates. This is what Krugman, Bernanke and even free market guys like Milton Friedman said caused banks to fail and credit to stop flowing thus causing the depression. But surely, the Austrian solution (with the FED in place) would be raise rates to purge the economy of the bad investments made during the boom. Is this the right assumption? What would and Austrian economist do if put in charge of the FED in 1929?",finance,2010-11-14,-0.0684559982094763

Economics,Why did China buy all those T bills?,"At the moment the Chinese government is whining about QE2. The Fed is going to buy bonds which will force down their value and devalue the US dollar too. So QE2 is not really in their interests.

Now it seems to me that they bought US T bills because they wanted to stop the RMB rising against the USD which would make their exports appear more expensive in the US. 

Still if their plan was to prevent RMB appreciation against the USD it would seem like any USD denominated assets would have done the trick. 

So they could have bought bonds, equities and some gold for example. Of course buying gold wouldn't decrease the value of the USD, but it would immunize them somewhat if the value of the USD fell in future as that would tend to make the value of gold increase. 

So their problem is that they were insufficiently diversified. Actually it's been clear for years that the Fed would quantitatively ease as soon as interest rates were near zero if CPI kept falling - in fact with a bit of imagination that possibility was clear from the advice US economists gave to Japan back in the 90's and the internet and property bubbles that inflated in the US economy from that point onwards. Clearly if there was ever a point where there was no new bubble to replace the last one to burst the US economy could easily deflate. If that happened the consensus advice would be to drop interest rates until the hit zero and if the CPI kept heading for zero start quantitative easing.

More to the point imagine if inflation had gone up - then a 100% bond portfolio is a bad idea as it can't grow fast enough to protect against inflation. So even if there had been no bust it would have been a bad idea.

tl;dr - 100% bond portfolios are a bad idea - why did the Chinese not realize this?

Edit ""The Fed is going to buy bonds which will force down their value and devalue the US dollar too."" should be ""The Fed is going to buy bonds which will force down their yield and devalue the US dollar too."" Buying bonds increases their price but that makes them a less attractive investment. D'oh.",finance,2010-11-15,-0.5185167321728535

politics,"My letter to Senator Kerry re: TSA security, my rights, and my child","As I understand, you will be present at a hearing for the Senate Subcommittee on Aviation Operations, Safety, and Security tomorrow morning. I have a few concerns that I would like to relay and hope that you will bring up during that hearing.

My comments generally center around the rationale of the ""enhanced pat-down"" and backscatter imaging technology currently mandatory at airports such as Boston's Logan International Airport.

I do not believe that it is a reasonable search for you to be required to have a naked photograph taken (albeit in the non-visible spectrum, it's still a naked photograph) or, the alternative, a vigorous pat down when there is no reasonable suspicion of illicit activity other than happening to enter an airport.

Under the Terry Stop laws, individuals detained for questioning can't be compelled to undergo more than a cursory pat-down to be assured the detainee doesn't have any weapons on them. Under this process, everyone, including infants, is exposed to this indignity regardless of their having committed a crime or even civil violation. 

Furthermore, I believe that these techniques violate the Laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, specifically MGL Ch. 272 ss.4 and 29B, especially as they pertain to minor children. These laws protect children and adults from being molested or forced to have naked photographs taken of their selves, yet this is what the Federal government, via the TSA, is doing every day in these airport security lines. If this were being done by a private company, there would be not only civil but criminal liability in these techniques. And the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution does not extend the Federal government's immunity to these procedures as there is no Federal law that allows agents of the government to molest or photograph my naked child; this is only a procedure the TSA has selected. This is abhorrent to the decency and dignity of the Commonwealth that its citizens are so treated by its own Federal government.

In 2008, the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics noted about 810 million airline passengers. The TSA annual budget just for aviation security sits at $4.8 billion, or about $6 per airline passenger per year for security. The total annual budget of the FBI is $7.9 billion, not even equal that of the TSA as a whole. Even if there were 100 successful terrorist attacks on airplanes taking an average of 400 lives in each attack (40,000 deaths), it still would not equal the national homicide rate (5.4/100,000) for the same year. Flying just isn't so risky as to somehow require billions of dollars and an invasive search to secure.

I would very much love to sit down and discuss this with you or one of your staffers. I will be travelling with my full family this coming December, and if these regulations don't change, I will want to video the TSA going through his pat-down process on myself and my 2-year-old son so that others will see how invasive it is. I will be very upset, but as of now, I will have no recourse because ""the Federal government"" said so and damned be the 4th Amendment or the Laws of Massachusetts.

Very Respectfully Yours,

EDIT: jgzman points out that my statistics ought to have used comparables. 40,000 deaths as stated above would be better written as ""4.9 deaths per 100,000 passengers"".",technology,2010-11-16,-0.0905113267583175

        The Real Truth About Sarah Palin

Oh wait, since SNL and hardball shows always make fun of Sarah Palin, we are supposed to laugh with them because those sources of info are funny and oh so smart.  Who cares if she did what so many of us know is the right way to serve the public (read below)?  Just keep listening and believing what the east coast media  tells you until it's too late!  We'll see how much everyone laughs then!!!                                        


Sarah Palin


Democrat, Independent, or Republican....the second half of this email should make all of us very sick, send this on .....especially the second half !!!  


By Dewie Whetsell,   

Alaskan Fisherman. 

The last 45 of my 66 years I've spent in a commercial fishing town in Alaska. I understand Alaska politics but never understood national politics well until this last year. Here's the breaking point: Neither side of the Palin controversy gets it. It's not about persona, style, rhetoric, it's about doing things. Even Palin supporters never mention the things that I'm about to mention here.
 
1. Democrats forget when Palin was the Darling of the Democrats, because as soon as Palin took the Governor's office away from a fellow Republican and tough SOB, Frank Murkowski, she tore into the Republican's ""Corrupt Bastards Club"" (CBC) and sent them packing. Many of them are now residing in State housing and wearing orange jump suits The Democrats reacted by skipping around the yard, throwing confetti and singing, ""la la la la"" (well, you know how they are). Name another governor in this country that has ever done anything similar. 

2. Now with the CBC gone, there were fewer Alaskan politicians to protect the huge, giant oil companies here. So she constructed and enacted a new system of splitting the oil profits called ""ACES."" Exxon (the biggest corporation in the world) protested and Sarah told them, ""don't let the door hit you in the stern on your way out."" They stayed, andAlaska residents went from being merely wealthy to being filthy rich. Of course, the other huge international oil companies meekly fell in line. Again, give me the name of any other governor in the country that has done anything similar.

3. The other thing she did when she walked into the governor's office is she got the list of State requests for federal funding for projects, known as ""pork."" She went through the list, took 85% of the money and placed them in the ""when-hell-freezes-over"" stack. She let locals know that if we need something built, we'll pay for it ourselves. Maybe she figured she could use the money she got from selling the previous governor's jet because it was extravagant.  


Maybe she could use the money she saved by dismissing the governor's cook (remarking that she could cook for her own family), giving back the State vehicle issued to her, maintaining that she already had a car, and dismissing her State provided security force (never mentioning - I imagine - that she's packing heat herself). I'm still waiting to hear the names of those other governors.

4. Now, even with her much-ridiculed ""gosh and golly"" mannerism, she also managed to put together a totally new approach to getting a natural gas pipeline built which will be the biggest private construction project in the history of North America. No one else could do it although they tried. If that doesn't impress you, then you're trying too hard to be unimpressed while watching her do things like this while baking up a batch of brownies with her other hand.
 
5. For 30 years, Exxon held a lease to do exploratory drilling at a place called Point Thompson. They made excuses the entire time why they couldn't start drilling. In truth they were holding it like an investment. No governor for 30 years could make them get started. Then, she told them she was revoking their lease and kicking them out. They protested and threatened court action. She shrugged and reminded them that she knew the way to the court house. Alaska won again.
 
6. President Obama wants the nation to be on 25% renewable resources for electricity by 2025. Sarah went to the legislature and submitted her plan for Alaska to be at 50% renewable by 2025. We are already at 25%. I can give you more specifics about things done, as opposed to style and persona. Everybody wants to be cool, sound cool, look cool. But that's just a cover-up. I'm still waiting to hear from liberals the names of other governors who can match what mine has done in two and a half years. I won't be holding my breath.
 
By the way, she was content to return to AK after the national election and go to work, but the haters wouldn't let her. Now these adolescent screechers are obviously not scuba divers. And no one ever told them what happens when you continually jab and pester a barracuda. Without warning, it will spin around and tear your face off. Shoulda known better!

You have just read the truth about Sarah Palin that sends the media, along with the democrat party, into a wild uncontrolled frenzy to discredit her. I guess they are only interested in skirt chasers, dishonesty, immoral people, liars, womanizers, murderers, and bitter ex-presidents' wives.
 
So ""You go, Girl."" I only wish the men in Washington had your guts, determination, honesty, and morals. I rest my case. Only FOOLS listen to the biased media.

14. $  57,500 - Lewis, Dana M. (Special Assistant and Personal Aide to the First Lady) 
15. $  52,500 - Mustaphi, Semonti M. (Associate Director and Deputy Press Secretary to The First Lady)

There has NEVER been anyone in the White House at any time who has created such an army of staffers whose sole duties are the facilitation of the First Lady's social life. One wonders why she needs so much help, at taxpayer expense, when even Hillary, only had three; Jackie Kennedy one; Laura Bush one; and prior to Mamie Eisenhower social help came from the President's own pocket.
Note: This does not include makeup artist Ingrid Grimes-Miles, 49, and ""First Hairstylist"" Johnny Wright, 31, both of whom traveled aboard Air Force One to   Europe  .

politics,I wrote this letter to the White House today in response to Obama's apparent willingness to compromise on the Bush-imposed tax cuts for the rich. I urge you all to give President Obama a piece of your mind as well.,"Mr. President,

I am a 24 year old college student. I was only able to begin attending college this year because of the asinine laws in place regarding Federal education loans and adults aged 18-23 not being able to be considered legally independent of your parents regardless of one's financial and familial situation. That's an entirely different issue though that for some reason no one ever wants to consider addressing.

Anyhow, I am writing to you today because I feel as though you have abandoned myself and the millions of other young Americans who put you in the White House and cemented Democratic control of Congress in 2008. I donated $50 to your campaign, which isn't easy for a 22 year old by the way. I spent countless hours making phone calls and knocking on doors in this great state of Virginia whose people voted for a Democratic Presidential candidate for the first time since the 1960's. I did all of this because you are a remarkably intelligent individual and I believed in your sincerity and decency on a basic human level. I felt that you had a sincere desire to change the culture of venality in Washington's institutions, but each passing day seems to further indicate that you are nothing more than another puppet of America's concealed plutocracy. I understand that it is not easy to change or work within our political system. I understand the challenges and hurdles you must overcome on a daily basis, but that is no excuse for you weak-kneed approach to Republican obstructionism. Your failure to stand strong and enact bold measures to create jobs and regulate Wall Street is the reason why Republicans now overwhelmingly control the House of Representatives.

I have been patient with your administration and have defended you when assailed by my progressive brethren. However, I will no longer even moderately support you if you allow Republicans to extend the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest 2% of Americans. The American people truly need those funds, not the arrogant, privileged fat cats who don't give a rat's ass about anybody or anything but their mansions and social status. Simply put, I WILL NOT vote for you in 2012 and I will do everything in my power to convince everyone I know to vote third party in 2012 if you allow these tax cuts to be extended for the greediest, most unpatriotic 2% of Americans whose interests you seem to be eager to cater to. Please don't compromise on this issue. Some issues are too important for compromise, and this is most certainly one of them. Good day sir.

 

Sincerely,

Me
Richmond, VA﻿

politics,America is Fucked,"Attention self-proclaimed conservatives: if you want to know what conservatism really is just take a look at Barry Goldwater. He was a staunch conservative: pro-choice, anti-war, he supported gay rights and separation of church and state. He believed that issues like abortion and religion should be handled by individuals, not by the government. Today he would be considered a libertarian, but back then he was known as a conservative. When the evangelicals took over the republican party and became a bunch of Reagan worshippers, Goldwater distanced himself from them because he knew they were dangerous fools who would ruin this country and rob the people of their liberties.

Goldwater's opponent, Lyndon B. Johnson, was a left-wing democrat. He defeated Goldwater with a campaign ad depicting a little girl being vaporized by a nuclear warhead, suggesting that this would happen if Goldwater were elected. He was a monster who robbed young poor black and white kids of their future and sent them to Vietnam where they dropped napalm on children and came back crippled, maimed, addicted to heroin, and completely traumatized. The ones who are still alive, you can find them on the side of the road begging for spare change. President Johnson was a liar, a murderer, and a piece of shit. He had a heart attack and died at age 64, which was 64 years too late.

Today conservatism has been completely hijacked by so-called fundamentalist Christians, but they are really nothing of the sort. Christianity is a philosophy founded on the principals of love, forgiveness, rejection of material wealth, and personal freedom. Most of the people who call themselves Christians are hateful, grudge-bearing, greedy little fascists and if Jesus were alive today he'd be firebombing their churches and laughing as the pedophiles and idolators are baptized in flames.

And as for modern liberals, they have potential to fix things, but they are weak-minded, overpriviledged, and disenfranchised. Most of them don't really care about America, they are motivated by their own selfish needs like wanting the government to give them free healthcare. And they don't stand firm on anything, they are always willing to compromise. They gave up on legalizing drugs, which would end the drug war and keep a lot of sick people out of prison and save a lot of lives. Now they just want to settle for being allowed to have a little weed. They are self-proclaimed intellectuals and they are too arrogant to educate themselves on the fundamentals of American society.

The Tea Party movement was originally a group of people who believed in constitutional rights and doing away with the Federal Reserve and saving this country from the bankers and CEOs that are bleeding us dry. They were educated people of different colors and creeds and they came together to bring back the values the founding fathers built this country on. But the media labelled them as Christian conservatives so now that movement has been hijacked by the bible-beaters and completely ruined. You won't find any of the original people at the meetings anymore - you'll find a bunch of angry, white, Christian rednecks and housewives whose primary social imperative is to keep faggots from getting married.

The time has come for people to abandon labels and educate themselves. The people who really know whats going on could be able to change things, but they're always outnumbered by the ignorant scum who want more for themselves and less for everyone else. As long as the poor are squabbling amongst themselves and watching Jersey Shore and standing in line for lotto tickets and malt liquor, nothing's gonna change. Democracy is a complete failure in this country because the people are ignorant and weak and you can't help people that won't help themselves.

Our political parties are meaningless and their values can change at any time. The Independants make a valiant effort but they don't stand a chance: the Democrats and Republicans have corporate sponsorship and media promotion. And Obama's not going to fix anything. Not because he's a bad president, but because he is physically unable to. The government doesn't have any power anymore, America is property of The Federal Reserve Bank and Goldman Sachs Inc. They are the ones in charge, not the president. If you want proof, take a look at what happened to JFK after he tried to shut down the Fed. America is broken and there's no peaceful way to fix it. It's going to require a lot of bloodshed and personal sacrifice. That's why it's not gonna happen until the people realize that they have absolutely nothing to lose.

And to those who will inevitably label me as a conspiracy nut or something like that, I suggest you watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO0-u900OG4",energy,2010-11-18,-0.3522574486078537

politics,A TSA solution for everyone?,"Sorry if anything like this has already been posted and sorry if I get some facts wrong, I'm still trying to figure this all out for myself as well.

From what I understand of the situation, the problems people have with the TSA are 

1. being unprofessional or even the threat of being unprofessional (includes being pervy)
2. not doing much for the money they get
3. general distrust of the federal government, especially this one.

Wouldn't one solution be to gradually phase out the civilian TSA screeners and replace them with military? It'd be a compromise of the Israeli model (troops would just be doing screenings) but without the incredibly long delays and racial and psychological profiling

According to [their website](http://www.tsa.gov/press/where_we_stand/accomplishments.shtm),
""TSA has increased the number of new hires starting from approximately 200 per pay period in February to nearly 900 for the pay period starting early September 2006.""

you stop this and start a harsh program of cutting the slackers while moving the competent, tenured people to non-crotch grabbing capacities, either administrative/managerial or security in the rest of the airport (watching doors, inspecting packages, patrolling the Sbarro's). 

The troops doing the screening would either be newer ones who will have to learn how to do such security checks and gain crowd control skills anyway or those just returning from overseas who already have them. It'll also be a decent job for those veterans who might not be able to find them in this economy.

They would be professional and ""have skin in the game"" as they say. If some random yahoo who works at the TSA keeps images of your pudgy nekkidness or singles out the hot chick for a little game of grab-ass, they just get fired. If one of these troops do it, might a dishonorable discharge and loss of any kind of benefits sting more? I might be wrong here but don't members of the armed forces also get psych profiles that'll cut down on any pervy or otherwise unsavory behavior?
Besides, I double dog dare you to threaten a Marine whose next or most recent job was ducking bullets in a desert who's just doing his job with arrest. More likely than not, you'll salute and offer a ""thank you, may I have another""

This would increase the defense budget and the size of the military, something Republicans love, while also having the added effect of cutting out private contractors, lobbyists and those legislators and talking heads who'd seek to gain either through money or publicity.

politics,"My friend served a subpoena to Álvaro Uribe, former Colombian president whose military killed thousands of innocent people, &amp; now 5 cops are saying she pushed aside a big security guard (she's 5'7 &amp; tiny) and Uribe, so that he won't have to respond to the subpoena. (Details &amp; what we can do within)","My friend Charity Ryerson has been working on Colombian human rights for years, especially looking at Álvaro Uribe's chain of command (links to info about his crimes are at the bottom of this post).  Uribe recently got hired onto the faculty at Georgetown (where Charity is a law student).  There's a huge group working to get the university to fire Uribe, including faculty, human rights activists, organizations, and students, including Charity - she's obviously infuriated that the man she's been protesting for years is now on the faculty at her school.  When Conrad &amp; Scherer managed to get a subpoena from a federal judge in Alabama, Charity showed up at Uribe's class (w/ TV cameras and everything) to serve him with it.  Instead of allowing the justice system to function, Georgetown called in extra security and literally removed a classroom wall to escort Uribe to safety so he couldn't be served with the subpoena.

Later that day, by totally lucky coincidence, she saw a group of his security guards in the lobby of a building on campus.  She didn't have the TV cameras with her anymore, but realizing this was her only chance, she figured out where Uribe was, and (with a group of students and others) served him before anyone noticed she was there.  Now that he's been officially served, the only ways he can get off without testifying about his relationships to paramilitary death squads (he has never had to testify before) are by trying to get the US and Colombian governments to give him some sort of immunity (but he's no longer a president, so this shouldn't work), or to convince the judge he really doesn't know about what he's subpoenaed to testify about (and fat chance on that one).  In case those ideas fall through, he's already claiming that she pushed past a great big campus police officer on her way to serve him with the subpoena, then hit him with the papers so hard that it knocked him backwards (he's really claiming this - she's 5'7 and like 120 pounds), which would make the subpoena invalid AND make her liable for assault and battery.

Five officers are now confirming this absurd story.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Aside from the fact that she is tiny, Charity used to give nonviolence trainings (basically teaching people how to be nonviolent in tense situations, or more specifically: how to not do what she’s accused of doing here), and, in addition, she currently attends one of the best law schools in the country - she's knowledgeable enough about service of process where she would never jeopardize this cause, or go against her legal training, by pushing a police officer or hitting someone while serving them papers, even if she was physically capable of it.  But right now it's 5 police officers' word against her few witnesses, and things are not looking good.

If people believe these cops' ridiculous claims, not only would it mean that Uribe gets off scott-fucking-free, it could have ramifications in terms of her future legal career.  Any of you who've ever thought ""Hey, instead of just sitting around upvoting shit on reddit, maybe I should go to fucking law school and learn how to make a difference from within the system"" - she's the one-in-a-million person who's actually going to the trouble to do that, and she's the one-in-a-billion person who had the guts to stand up to a former fucking president of Colombia, and now her whole future is in jeopardy because this FUCKING Colombian MURDERER is doing everything he can to quash her ability to not only make him answer for his crimes, but also her ability to pursue her own professional career.

HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO:

As long as Georgetown lends Uribe legitimacy by keeping him on their faculty, it is likely that he can continue to hide behind the school's reputation and avoid legal justice.  We have to go straight to the president of the school, John DeGioia.  Everyone has told Charity ""we can't help you, this happened entirely inside of the president's office.""  There are apparently no other pressure points. So be it. 

President DeGioia’s phone number: (202) 687-4134.  Say whatever you personally believe, of course, but here's a good starting point:  Tell him that you've heard that he has a murderous former president on his faculty and you don't think that's very awesome, and that maybe he should stop providing Uribe cover for his crimes.

President DeGioia's email address: PresidentsOffice@georgetown.edu.  Maybe tell him that you don't think it's very cool that their campus police are trying to stop Charity Ryerson from serving a murderous former Colombian president with a subpoena - if he's such a great guy why is he so afraid of a fucking subpoena?  And if a small girl really knocked over their campus police officer like she was Bo Jackson on Tecmo Bowl (with goddamn NES Advantage turbo ability), then how come they hired such a wispy police force?

BLOG THIS, TWEET THIS, ETC. - I can say without reservation that Charity is the rare example of an honestly courageous person.  As a result, she's being stomped on by cops to protect a FUCKING MURDERER.  I mean, please, go ahead and research this for yourself and come to your own conclusions, but once you do, PLEASE POST THOSE CONCLUSIONS ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE THAT YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

As important as it is that Uribe testify to his crimes, this issue is so much larger than just one subpoena.  No one should be completely beyond justice like this.

**tl;dr - My friend served murderous former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe with a subpoena in Washington DC and now 5 cops are claiming assault so that Uribe doesn't have to testify in court.**

&gt; Hence the axis of depression. No doubt some of Mr. Bernanke’s critics are motivated by sincere intellectual conviction, but the core reason for the attack on the Fed is self-interest, pure and simple. China and Germany want America to stay uncompetitive; Republicans want the economy to stay weak as long as there’s a Democrat in the White House.

As politicians get a handle on what policies lead to stronger economic performance, is it possible that we will begin seeing the deliberate destruction of the US economy for political advantage?

The fact of the matter is that, yes, Democrats are more likely to win reelection of unemployment is low on November 2012, and if they lose, they will be more likely to win in 2016 if unemployment is high then.

Am I naive in thinking there has to be something that prevents both parties from expending energy actively sabotaging the economy when they are not in power?

politics,On the TSA scanners and something that's been bothering me.,"How many of you have watched or heard someone defend the new practice of the TSA scanners?  They always talk about how there's a need for increased security because the terrorists are ""becoming more clever""?  I've seen quite a bit, and one thing I noticed really bothered me.

Out of everyone I've heard defend these scanners, nearly all of them have cited the so-called ""Underwear Bomber"", saying with only our traditional screening methods, he never could be caught.  Every time I heard that argument, there was something that just struck me as ""too convenient"".  It sounds to me like they were saying, ""Wow, if ONLY we had some kind of technology that allowed us to see inside people's underwear, we could stop this kind of attack!""  Lo and behold, less than a year later, the TSA starts deploying these body scanners around the country.

Am I the only one completely bothered by this?  The body scanners have been in use around the world in select locations for a few years now, and a failed attack like the Underwear Bomber is such a beautifully perfect justification for the TSA to start adopting them.  I really hate going all conspiracy theorist, since I don't really believe in those much, but this just bothers me a bit too much.

As a result, I did a bit of Wikipedia-ing to find out a bit more.  Turns out there are a few important pieces of information that the TSA doesn't tell you when justifying this crap.  They say that the Underwear Bomber couldn't be stopped without enhanced security, but one thing they don't tell you is that the flight that he tried to destroy took off from Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam, and was headed for Michigan.  It was not even a domestic flight, so no matter how much the TSA beefed up their security, the man would not have been stopped. ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Airlines_Flight_253))

But it gets worse than that.  As it turns out, Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam **already had the body scanners installed, and the Underwear Bomber was not stopped.** Schiphol was in fact the first airport in the world to install these body scanners ([source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_body_scanner#Usage)).  Since then, a terrorist successfully bypassed the body scanners with explosives, an incident which our government is now using to justify the use of the **exact same scanners that failed** in an attempt to ""enhance"" security.

Economics,I don't understand how tax cuts for the rich would help the economy.  Please help me get it,"The rich aren't experiencing a recession right now - in fact, they are doing very well.  They have enough money to hire workers, but there is no point in increasing production (either through hiring or investment in equipment) if there is no demand for their products.

Also, there is plenty of cheap money available with interest rates so low.  If the rich wanted to expand production, they could borrow this money and invest in employment and equipment.  Unfortunately, a bank will require that you show evidence that when you borrow the  money, you can use it to make more money to pay back that debt, which they can't do because there is no more demand for whatever they sell.

Because there are no good investments to be made, the only way the rich can make more money in this economy is by cutting their costs further.  Now that they have laid off their extra employees and their equipment can't be sold (again, nobody wants to buy it because they can't make money off of it), the only cost they can cut is their taxes.

If you want to get the economy moving, you have to increase demand somehow.  That means putting money in the hands of people who would demand products IF they had the money.  We could just give cash to this group, but that would create a moral hazard.  A better idea would be to employ them doing something - like building infrastructure, which needs to get done anyway.

I can look at the CD rates I can get and tell that my bank isn't particularly interested in borrowing money from me right now. Which makes sense because they won't get a good return on that capital because interest rates are low.

politics,States rights and how we can take back our democracy,"I came up with an interesting idea that I think could be the key to fixing our government.  Please provide feedback and criticisms to help mold this idea.

There is a distinct difference in the election process between a state government and the federal government.  My example is in the state of Ohio.  In my state a person is allowed to write an amendment to be proposed to the legislature to vote upon based on petitions.  The first step is writing the amendment and gathering 1000 signatures and then submitting it to the ohio board of elections and it will be reviewed by the state attorney general.  Upon validation of the amendment and the signatures the legislature will then vote on the amendment.  If it fails the next step is to gather more signatures via petition.  Normally, this is done by going out to very popular areas and asking people for signatures.  My idea is we digitize this.  We create a simple web site that will allow a person to enter their information as a voter and digitally sign the petition.  We then can submit them to be put on the ballot of the next election cycle for the entire state to vote on.  

Here's why I think this will work:
1) Young voters participate in the election process online.  We are good are spreading information digitally: facebook, twitter, email, messaging.  It travels fast and thus would allow us to collect the required amount of signatures to get common sense amendments passed for state governments.  

2) If this process is capable of doing what is is designed to do we can pass common sense approaches to solving our problems in a local setting.  Think of how the current federal government and state government creates legislation.  Typically a corporation writes the bill and then gives it to a lobbyist who then gets it into the hand of a representative to present the bill and request a vote on it.  This would allow the people to take control that process.  The process would be state based and give states their power back.  

3) Here is my main goal to achieve.  First I would like to see the states gain financial control of the federal income tax dollars paid by their citizens because the state is who collects and pays this to the federal government.  We could dictate to the federal government that we are only paying for services in which the state agrees on as a whole.  If we passed a bill that said we are paying for local infrastructure changes or things that the state agrees upon to be in the best interest of the itself and the United States then we would cut off their source of funding.

The federal government is a huge drain on our financial resources.  We should be spending these dollars on improving OUR lives not every other country on the planet that we get no benefit from giving funding to.  We put our foot down and say enough is enough our state dictates that we choose how much funding you get and how it is spent by you otherwise we are not stealing this money from our citizens to benefit corporations, endless wars and military spending, subsidies, welfare and disability fraud, pork barrel spending, earmarks.  We as the states can say here is our share of the funds and this is what you're going to do with them and if you screw it up we will be deducting those funds from next years federal income tax and investing them in our own state to benefit our people.

Please provide input and constructive criticism.  I want this to be a productive thread because I'm fed up with how broken our system is and I want to see us start working together to fix it because if we don't who will?

TL;DR We need to use the internet to get common sense laws passed to fix our problems on a state by state basis to show the federal government we the people are the ones in charge.",finance,2010-11-22,0.0005023013697465
politics,"My friend served a subpoena to Álvaro Uribe, former Colombian president whose military killed thousands of innocent people, &amp; now 5 cops are saying she pushed aside a big security guard (she's 5'7 &amp; tiny) and Uribe, so that he won't have to respond to the subpoena. (Details &amp; what we can do within)","My friend Charity Ryerson has been working on Colombian human rights for years, especially looking at Álvaro Uribe's chain of command (links to info about his crimes are at the bottom of this post).  Uribe recently got hired onto the faculty at Georgetown (where Charity is a law student).  There's a huge group working to get the university to fire Uribe, including faculty, human rights activists, organizations, and students, including Charity - she's obviously infuriated that the man she's been protesting for years is now on the faculty at her school.  When Conrad &amp; Scherer managed to get a subpoena from a federal judge in Alabama, Charity showed up at Uribe's class (w/ TV cameras and everything) to serve him with it.  Instead of allowing the justice system to function, Georgetown called in extra security and literally removed a classroom wall to escort Uribe to safety so he couldn't be served with the subpoena.

Later that day, by totally lucky coincidence, she saw a group of his security guards in the lobby of a building on campus.  She didn't have the TV cameras with her anymore, but realizing this was her only chance, she figured out where Uribe was, and (with a group of students and others) served him before anyone noticed she was there.  Now that he's been officially served, the only ways he can get off without testifying about his relationships to paramilitary death squads (he has never had to testify before) are by trying to get the US and Colombian governments to give him some sort of immunity (but he's no longer a president, so this shouldn't work), or to convince the judge he really doesn't know about what he's subpoenaed to testify about (and fat chance on that one).  In case those ideas fall through, he's already claiming that she pushed past a great big campus police officer on her way to serve him with the subpoena, then hit him with the papers so hard that it knocked him backwards (he's really claiming this - she's 5'7 and like 120 pounds), which would make the subpoena invalid AND make her liable for assault and battery.

Five officers are now confirming this absurd story.  It's absolutely ridiculous.  Aside from the fact that she is tiny, Charity used to give nonviolence trainings (basically teaching people how to be nonviolent in tense situations, or more specifically: how to not do what she’s accused of doing here), and, in addition, she currently attends one of the best law schools in the country - she's knowledgeable enough about service of process where she would never jeopardize this cause, or go against her legal training, by pushing a police officer or hitting someone while serving them papers, even if she was physically capable of it.  But right now it's 5 police officers' word against her few witnesses, and things are not looking good.

If people believe these cops' ridiculous claims, not only would it mean that Uribe gets off scott-fucking-free, it could have ramifications in terms of her future legal career.  Any of you who've ever thought ""Hey, instead of just sitting around upvoting shit on reddit, maybe I should go to fucking law school and learn how to make a difference from within the system"" - she's the one-in-a-million person who's actually going to the trouble to do that, and she's the one-in-a-billion person who had the guts to stand up to a former fucking president of Colombia, and now her whole future is in jeopardy because this FUCKING Colombian MURDERER is doing everything he can to quash her ability to not only make him answer for his crimes, but also her ability to pursue her own professional career.

HERE'S WHAT YOU CAN DO:

As long as Georgetown lends Uribe legitimacy by keeping him on their faculty, it is likely that he can continue to hide behind the school's reputation and avoid legal justice.  We have to go straight to the president of the school, John DeGioia.  Everyone has told Charity ""we can't help you, this happened entirely inside of the president's office.""  There are apparently no other pressure points. So be it. 

President DeGioia’s phone number: (202) 687-4134.  Say whatever you personally believe, of course, but here's a good starting point:  Tell him that you've heard that he has a murderous former president on his faculty and you don't think that's very awesome, and that maybe he should stop providing Uribe cover for his crimes.

President DeGioia's email address: PresidentsOffice@georgetown.edu.  Maybe tell him that you don't think it's very cool that their campus police are trying to stop Charity Ryerson from serving a murderous former Colombian president with a subpoena - if he's such a great guy why is he so afraid of a fucking subpoena?  And if a small girl really knocked over their campus police officer like she was Bo Jackson on Tecmo Bowl (with goddamn NES Advantage turbo ability), then how come they hired such a wispy police force?

BLOG THIS, TWEET THIS, ETC. - I can say without reservation that Charity is the rare example of an honestly courageous person.  As a result, she's being stomped on by cops to protect a FUCKING MURDERER.  I mean, please, go ahead and research this for yourself and come to your own conclusions, but once you do, PLEASE POST THOSE CONCLUSIONS ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE THAT YOU HAVE AN AUDIENCE.

As important as it is that Uribe testify to his crimes, this issue is so much larger than just one subpoena.  No one should be completely beyond justice like this.

**tl;dr - My friend served murderous former Colombian president Álvaro Uribe with a subpoena in Washington DC and now 5 cops are claiming assault so that Uribe doesn't have to testify in court.**

politics,Religious Establishments and Ordered Liberty - Let's discuss,"So my Political Science professor issued some questions for us for a final term paper due in a month. I chose this question to argue:

""The limitation that the establishment clause of the first amendment places upon federal authority has been deemed to operate upon the states, as well, through the fourteenth amendment.  The language used to describe in general those rights which the fourteenth amendment protects include:  “fundamental principles of liberty and justice which lie at the base of all our civil and political institutions,” Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932); “of the very essence of a scheme of ordered liberty, […] neither liberty nor justice could exist if they were sacrificed” Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319 (1937); and “the basic civil rights of man,” Skinner v. Oklahoma, 316 U.S. 535 (1942).  It has been contended, however, that at the time the first amendment was ratified, several states had what would now be considered religious establishments, and that the original intent of the establishment clause was in part to protect these establishments.  Many of the Founders and their European predecessors argued that religious establishments were compatible with and indeed essential to republican self-government; they were opposed by many others.  This debate can be phrased as one over whether religious establishments are compatible with (or even essential to) a scheme of ordered liberty.  How do the arguments of each side fare against those of the other?""

Very long-winded, yes, but I think a great discussion can be had with this.

This is the Reply:


So that video made some good points and, some BAD points. I just have to find a video, find a find a video to believe in . . . 


Since I couldn't find a video to believe in (although [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohKQP_wSO9k)
 comes close) so I decided to figure it out for myself. Here's what I came up with:


**The Problem as Seen by the Fed**: Banks won't lend to US corporates and households thus keeping the economy below its current potential. (This proposition is, of course debatable since US corporates seem to have plenty of cash on hand and yet appear reluctant to lend while US households appear to be drowning in debt and thus may be unable to take on more debt.) Instead of lending to corporates and households, banks are using their balance sheets to borrow at virtually zero interest rates and buy riskless US Treasuries. Since US treasuries are currently earning about 150 basis points for 5-year maturities and about 210 basis points for 7-year maturities, banks may, in the eyes of the Fed, be happy to earn such yields rather than lend to corporates and households.


**The Fed's Solution**: The Fed wants to push down yields especially (according to published reports) for Treasuries with 5 and 7-year maturities. The Fed intends to accomplish this by purchasing Treasuries with 5 and 7-year maturities held by the banks. Since the Fed will be increasing demand for these Treasuries, the price of the Treasuries will rise and their yields will fall. The Fed believes that banks will be more willing to lend to corporates and households if the yield on riskless assets falls low enough to make holding them by the banks unattractive. In addition, the Fed wishes to pump additional money into the economy via these same banks thus making more money available to lend by the banks to corporates and households. As I will explain in detail below, the Fed will accomplish this as they purchase Treasuries from the banks.


**The Process Explained**: In order to understand this process clearly (and ultimately its implications), we need to think about this process from the perspective of the Fed's balance sheet. A balance sheet lists the assets and liabilities of an entity and a balance sheet must be, well, balanced with assets equaling liabilities at all time. Now, the Fed has the power to create money out of thin air and the Fed will use this power to create a reported $600 billion. In other words, the Fed will increase its assets by $600 billion. The Fed will then use this additional liquidity on its balance sheet to purchase the Treasury bonds from the banks. The Fed will have then swapped one asset class (cash) for another asset class (bonds) of equal value. Note that we do not yet have any liabilities to match the assets the Fed has added to its balance sheet and the Fed's must create liabilities equal in value to those of the newly acquired assets. Now, banks are required to hold some of their own reserves with the Fed. In order to match the newly acquired assets the Fed holds on its balance sheet, the Fed will create additional reserves for the banks equal to the amount of bonds purchased by the Fed from the banks. These additional reserves can then be used by the banks to further increase their lending. Remember that these additional reserves represent claims against the Fed's newly acquired assets since the banks could theoretically lose these additional reserves in the event of insolvency. That is, these additional created reserves are a liability on the Fed's balance sheet.


**Implications of the Fed's Action**: It is important to remember that the Fed had not just  created money and dropped it from a helicopter since doing so would mean that the Fed would have lost all control over effects on the economy once the money was dumped overboard. Instead, the process described here will most certainly achieve one of the policy goals (flattening of the yield curve) and potentially achieve the other policy goal (increase lending). In addition, the Fed can unwind these trades and tighten monetary policy if something goes wrong. So what can go wrong? Unexpectedly strong inflation is certainly one risk, although the ability to unwind the trades and eliminate the additional reserves for the bank should limit any inflation risk to the short term. A decline in the dollar's value is a definite risk since the likelihood of leakage outside the US is high and extremely high if the appetite by corporates and households for further debt is limited (the money needs to go somewhere). Remember also that since the banks increased reserves with the Fed will enable the banks to lend multiples of the original $600 billion, the additional lending from the policy could easily be $5 trillion or more so there could easily be downward pressure on the dollar as a result. The most difficult problem may come when the Fed unwinds these trades. The banks will have near perfect information regarding the Fed's actions which means the markets will have near perfect information as well. A stampede out of stocks and bonds in the US and globally would be possible, if not likely. At the same time the dollar might well surge in value with the attendant negative effect on the US economy.


**Conclusion**: Quantitative easing is a daring, if not desperate, attempt by the Fed to stimulate the US economy. If the Fed is correct about the willingness of US  corporates and households to borrow money, the policy may work wonders. If not, then the primary effect will be to create asset bubbles in stocks and bonds in the US and around the world. Inflationary effects should be muted since no long-term inflationary expectations would be created by the policy. There is considerable downside risk to the dollar since leakage outside the US will be significant. How the Fed unwinds these trades appears to be the policy's greatest risk however since the Fed will need to fully transmit its intentions to the market at every stage of the rewinding process.


**Speculative Thought**: One question regarding QE I have had concerns China. Suppose that the stated intention by the Fed to increase lending domestically is simply a ruse by both the Fed and the US Government and that the real intent is to lower the dollar's value. A reduction in the dollar's value could increase the pressure on China to revalue the yuan since it would become more and more expensive for China to maintain its dollar peg. Could the ultimate intention be to blow China out of its peg? It does seem a bit fetched though.

The argument made to allow arbitrary search on the grounds that every US citizen and person is suspected of being engaged in terrorist activity could very easily and reasonably be extended to constant surveillance of all written or spoken communication, financial transactions, or movements.

So the US is in debt to a factor of several trillions, to countries like China etc. Since the US dollar is the world standard for trading, couldnt the US just simply print more US $ and repay china what it owes them? Yes, this would devalue the US $ considerably, but since the debt is measured in US$ atleast that would stay the same and the US could just repay it. 

In essence, what I'm asking is, couldn't the US artifically deflate the dollar in order to reduce the amount of the debt ( in terms of other currencies for example ) just to repay the debt. Then they could increase interest rates etc and bring the currency back under control.

*A central bank that was accumulating gold might be tempted to purchase domestic assets, thereby lowering home interest rates, increasing financial outflows, and driving gold abroad.*  
-Does it mean buying domestic bonds and subsequently reducing the yield on these bonds?  
   
My second question is to do with coverage of the Eurozone crisis 'contagion'. 
 When it's reported that ""some predict markets to attack Portugal next"", what does that entail? Is it investment banks shorting government bonds, for example?

politics,"My father makes $200,000 or more.  Is he greedy for not wanting to be taxed more?","Over the past week or so, I've found it very unnerving that so many pundits and redditors refer to all those making $200,000 or more as this monolithic body of evil, greedy rich people.  Is $200,000 that much in NYC?  Is it that much with a family to support?

My dad grew up dirt poor in a small town in the Appalachian mountains.  His father would scrape together whatever job he could whether it be truck-driving or coal mining.  They mainly fed themselves with their own vegetables and a few pigs.  My father strongly disliked the town since 99% of the people were either raving Pentecostals or Baptists and he was the polar opposite.

With high hopes and in pursuit of the American dream, he worked his ass off to get a scholarship to college and then to med school.  He simultaneously worked a job while in Med school just so he could eat.  He told me that at one point his food money was $5 for the week.

During his rotations in med school, he would be at the hospital for over 100 hours a week.  Once a resident, his pay was less than a nurse's salary.

Finally, at the age of 33, he had his first legitimate paycheck.

Every morning he wakes up at 5 am and is in the office by 6:30 am.  He works 6:30 AM - 6 PM five days a week.  If a patient cannot pay for their surgery, he will do it for a lessened price, or more often, free.  He has financially supported 2 children through their undergraduate and graduate school programs (easily over 400k), gives 10% of his money to charity, and I've never seen him buy anything for himself besides a pair of hiking boots.

He's not driving a ferrari.  He's not out on the yacht with Biff.  He spends his time hiking trails, listening to his old records on vinyl, and biking.

Now, when the talking heads on t.v. talk about ""the wealthiest Americans"" as if they're a bunch of greedy old Scrooges, think of this man who works his ass off, drives an old car, and helps out those in need without doing anything for himself.  Surely 40% of his salary going to local, state, and federal governments is enough

politics,FDA ban on caffeinated liquor seems rather anti-'free market',"This is the first thread of my own on Reddit.

We all know or should know that alcohol/tobacco/pharma have large controlling interests in the going-ons of the FDA. For the time being it's my theory that American liquor and possibly soda conglomerates pushed for this ban on caffeinated alcohol in order to keep the relatively new energy drink businesses from edging in on their profit turf any further.

To me it just seems ridiculous to outlaw something that we can mix on our own from readily available products. Of course, this DIY argument also applies to crystal meth, but I'm not saying that that should be legal simply because anyone boasting at least two digit IQs can make it with ease.

Sure it's not *healthy* to mix the two, but it's not as if alcohol on its own was ever safe, and that's what's really sticking in my craw. If they genuinely gave a damn about our health then cigarettes and tobacco would be gone while weed would be in. The fact that it was in stores legitimately for so short a time before the ban tells my unsettled mind that something else happened in a smoke filled room. Everything I know tells me that any baseless excuse will be used, any worthless product marketed, if there's the chance to pry our fat dollars from our hands; so why did this potentially new line of what is simply a mix drink need to receive a *Federal ban?* Did the FDA make this decision on their own or was the agenda pushed by something like the US Chamber of Commerce?

**TL;DR** Is caffeinated liquor really so dangerous that it needs to be outlawed, or have I seriously underestimated the amount of red tape wrapped around every product until now?",energy,2010-12-03,-0.1186762791822712

politics,"Your thoughts: Why is Obama a disappointment for Dems, but Bush not for Reps?","I think Dems/Progressive tend to be more idealistic and optimistic, so it is easier for them to be disappointed. Just look at Reddit posts about Obama trying to hold him accountable for his promises. Do you actually think he will? I don't. Progressives also tend to be more of a heterogeneous bunch, representing different ethnic and cultural groups, religious groups, education background, etc. It is mighty hard to appease such a diverse crowd of people.

On the other hand Republicans seem to be consistently satisfied with their elected officials. Perhaps its because Republicans tend to be a much more homogeneous group i.e. WASP. Whose list of expectations reads something like: is he Christian? Does he hate terrorist? Will he keep the status quo? I think Republicans are much easier to be satisfied by their officials because they represent a much narrower group with narrower objectives. 

I think this is one of the reasons why America as a nation has been sliding to the right, and why politicains who cause the mess keep getting re-elected. Simply put, Democrats get fed up with their politicians for not keeping promises and vote for someone else or not at all, or Democrats re-elected their spineless officials because it is the lesser of two evils. Republicans on the other hand keep voting for the same people because they are easily pleased (methinks fooled). 

What I find interesting is that its not so much that we have a two party system, but rather a one party system with the token minority guy. It appears to me that the Democratic party is basically the party for anyone who does not want to be a Republican (talking mainstream here, I know many Redditors are 3rd party), unfortunately since the Dems are kind of the token party, they had to sell out to corporations to keep up with the money the Reps were spending.  

TL;DR Democrats keep losing out for being to diverse/optimistic, Republicans keep winning for being homogeneous/simple.

hardware,Diagnosing PSU issues,"So I have been having issues which I have been attributing to my PSU(Ultra X-Connect  500w).

So there are two issues :

1.  It takes several tries to start from a cold boot. The computer will start and then turn off after a second or two. This cycle continues anywhere from 2 - 6 times until the hard drives start spinning and everything starts up. This issue has been around for a long time.

2.  Rarely the computer will simply die. I thought the cases were isolated but I recently found a way to repeat them. By starting up STALKER : Clear Sky and loading the settings all the way, DX10.1, the computer will shut down when I get into the game(not menu). I imagine I would have noticed this problem earlier but I have not really used the video card recently, no time to play. 

So my stats(listing anything significant drawing power) : 

Q6600 @ 3.0Ghz

4850 @ 10% increase mem and clock

4GB DDR2 RAM

2x SATA HDs

2x DVD drives

X-Fi XtremeMusic

4 or 5 fans with lights and some lights up front.

Beefed up CPU and GPU fans/heat-sinks

Self-powered speakers/3x USB devices


So, my questions to you :

1.  Would you guys agree that the PSU is the likely culprit? I think it's quite clear cut.

2.  ULTRA offers a lifetime warranty on their PSUs, I registered for it a long time ago(2005). Does any body have experience with their RMA process? Because I sure as hell can't find my receipt so I don't know whether it is even worth trying, I do have all the original packing though.

3.  What is specifically wrong and is this problem repairable? The PSU is modular and I really like it, so if repair is an option I am open to ideas. I know people, in general, do not usually fix broken electronics but I do so all the time, but I have never done anything like a PSU and I have no idea where to start. Any help in this regard would be appreciated.

4.  Assuming all other options are not viable, what should I buy as a replacement? I have a really limited budget and can't really get mid-high end stuff. I am limiting my self to the bare minimum required to run my system, no bells and whistles. I am even considering buy a crap PSU that will die, I just want it to last a couple of months until I can upgrade. My budget, maybe wishful thinking, is around $50 max. I've been using this PSU for 5 years so I have no idea what is going on in the market, if anything.

5.  Is there anyway to make the system usable in it's current state? How bad is the problem? It being winter I can forgo on using half the fans. I can also remove a DVD drive, maybe even the sound card. Use default clocks maybe? I doubt all this will help, my goal is to play STALKER:CS. I doubt I can make enough of a difference, but I want to know if anyone has tried this with success, or failure for that matter.

Thanks.

politics,"While we are on the subject of tax cuts why don't we discuss abolishing or reducing tax breaks for dependents. If you can't afford kids without a tax break, don't have them.","We aren't trying to populate the earth anymore. And I, for one, am tired of getting taxed for services meant for children I don't have while the parents get a break just because they figured out that Tab A goes in Slot A. Especially when I essentially get tax raped on the flip side because I don't have kids.

I am all for supporting the education of the nation's children but the state sure isn't doing much good with my money in that regard. How about tax incentives for people who donate to scholarship funds and the like?


**Edit**: I stepped out to run some errands so I will try to address the majority of the responses I got while I was out, since they are all essentially the same root ideology...



I am NOT anti-family or anti-child or anti-poor. I just think some accountability and return to family and community is in order. And that children no longer belong in the federal tax code.



I don't feel that I should have to make up for the fact that some guy in Omaha decided to have a basketball team, gets tax credits for it, and the only resultant contribution are kids that have to be partially educated with public funds, then have jobs provided for them in a market where more and more jobs are being moved out of the country, and all the while having the value instilled in them that it's their right to continue doing this being subsidized by the system. Put the burden on local churches that the families might attend or state and local social programs.



People keep saying they aren't being subsidized or we aren't ""paying"" them, but the fact of the matter is that there is a tax revenue target that has to be met. And every exemption that someone gets from paying their fair share gets passed on to someone else. And in this case that means that people who make the choice to not have children get hit harder than the people who either choose or just carelessly have children, **at the federal level**. A reduced loss is a net gain overall. It's math. You can call it what you want but at the end of the day guy with kids has more money in his pockets than guy without kids, solely based on the existence of the kid. I know it costs money to raise kids. I get that. It also costs money to make many choices in life that aren't a child. The debate on children vs other choices is a different thread.



It's everyones right to have children. But using children as an excuse to bow out tax liability shouldn't be an across the board given. Once upon a time it made sense to encourage child birth at the federal level. Those days have been over for a while. The current crop of kids are being brought up in a world where their fathers job is in danger of going over seas. His father's father's job probably already went to Mexico or somewhere else. There is no more industry in America. Our export is ideas. But try and get a job having ideas.

Yell at me all you want but if we don't start changing the way we run our society, please do think about me in the future when this all pans out. People have been moving all over the country just to find jobs for the better part of the last decade. And it doesn't show many signs of improving soon. It's not a financial collapse problem. It's a demand problem. When consumption outgrows productions locally it's the inevitable end result. You want to help America? Move to China and raise a family near a Foxconn plant making iPads and send the money back here.


Or you could just chill out on having kids for a while so we can sort out a better course of action. And part of getting people to do that is to make carelessly having large families a less attractive option.

**tl;dr** **This thread is about federal tax credits given to any for the sheer sake of a child existing. It has nothing to do with hating families or kids or god or America**. It has to do with shifting the support/burden to a more appropriate structure. Whether that is community, state, or something else.



**Accountability has to start somewhere.**


**Edit**: The narrowness of vision in some of these reactions to this topic are really disheartening.

As if the recipe for making a pie is:

Take pan, add pie.

**Edit**: OK lets pretend that we draw a line... After April 1st, 2012, the dependent tax exemption goes away for any yet to be conceived child for a family above the poverty line.
And lets pretend we announce this today. So there is plenty of notice.

Edit: I guess it was naive of me to assume all of you know anything about macroeconomics. Here's what I know, correct me if I am wrong:

The federal reserve controls interest rates. This is not because that power is bestowed upon them, it is just the product of hundreds of years of evolution of market systems. Interest rates are what shape the decisions of every single company involved in any type of finance. Interest rates affect every person's life, whether you know it or not. 

If anyone were to know anything about what the federal reserve is up to, ie what their target interest rate is, they would have a HUGE edge over everyone else.

If EVERYONE knew what the fed was up to, demand for loans would either drop to 0 until that new interest rate was put into place, or the supply of loans would drop to 0 until the new interest rate was put into place. This would send the loanable funds market into a shitstorm of collapse, and the economy would basically end.

[comment in a krugman post](http://community.nytimes.com/comments/www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/opinion/06krugman.html) — NYTimes


&gt; I am a CEO and someone who makes a lot of money.
&gt; 
&gt; If you are going to lead a company, there is no substitute for strong leadership. Part of being a strong leader is to take risks. There is an old saying that ""there can be no breakthrough without a breakup"". Unless a leader is willing to stand up for the long-run, call a competitors bluff, live with the short-term pain of the breakup, and be confident that taking a hard line stand will eventually lead to a breakthrough, they will never last in the top job.
&gt; 
&gt; As a high wealth earner I have three points I would like to make to Washington. One is that after my first $ 250,000 I just in invest my money into banks. While that my be good for banks, it does nothing for the economy's ability to create a multiplying effect because I am not going to spend the additional money on consumption.
&gt; 
&gt; The second is that I would would gladly have my marginal tax rates be higher so that the 99% of Americans with only 75% of the nation's wealth can prosper. I am not saying I academically believe in a progressive taxation. I am saying, that I can't make more money, if there is no thriving middle class to buy things I make.
&gt; 
&gt; Finally I am anti-government spending. More to the point I am against throwing too much money into too many pots. What I want is a national government to set strategic goals, and make a small amount of infrastructure investment bets that will eventually lead to long term growth.
&gt; 
&gt; The mythology of free enterprise alone leading to national wealth growth is an urban legend. The Erie canal that connected the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes turned Manhattan from an island port to the world's financial center. No canal, no skyscrapers, no free enterprise.
&gt; 
&gt; The same can be said by the North building a railway and telegraph system that defeated the South, kept the Union in-tact and was used by free enterprise to productively exploit western expansion. FHA and the GI Bill provided free enterprise with an unprecedented educated middle class to exploit. The national interstate highway was built, despite the national debt being 60% of GDP, allowed suburban expansion and better supply chains. Finally the Apollo program led to many inventions we use today. Most impressive though was the inspiration of a generation to become engineers and become the world's greatest inventor.
&gt; 
&gt; In each case, came targeted government investment and then free enterprise and wealth creation of everyone.

&gt; Today all we are doing is arguing about how a fixed amount of wealth should be distributed, instead of targeted investment for long-term wealth creation. The next big thing is a world class infrastructure and green jobs. A nation like China has the political will to win this race in a flat world. While the U.S. is still fighting 20th century battles.
&gt; 
&gt; Until everyone understands that one percent of us, have 24 % of the nation's wealth and are not going to spend it. Until everyone understands that wealthy people have a vested interest in a vibrant middle-class and is more than happy to pay higher taxes to achieve it. And until we realize we need a federal government to be the chief national investor instead of the chief national spender, Rome will continue to burn.",finance,2010-12-06,0.0709781975276838

politics,Republican here and I'd like to point a few things out... (feel free to downvote without reading),"Oh hai! Glad you decided to actually read this. I'm going to get straight to the point. Reading though a lot of the comments on the taxation posts today made me pretty pissed off and depressed. I feel like everyone (republicans and democrats) are ignoring the real problem.

Why isn't anyone asking about what our taxes are being spent on? The obvious answer is the liberal villain Defense Spending. You're absolutely right in 2009 it was $782 billion; it's the largest single expenditure in our government. I wholeheartedly believe we shouldn't be spending that much on defense alone. I also firmly believe that at some point defense spending will be drawn down over the next few years.

None of that is important when compared to the real problem of our entitlement programs. I'm sure you liberals just twitched thinking I'm going to rant about welfare but welfare is nothing compared to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. In 2009 the federal government spent roughly $1.3 trillion between those three programs. That is 39% of the budget...

Think about that.

The crisis we're facing is simple to explain but incredibly complicated to fix. Those programs are growing faster than our economy because of our aging population. As our people retire the overall tax base shrinks as well. While retirement benefits are taxed the revenue generated is fixed at whatever the current tax rate is. Therefore the net effect is limiting growth in tax revenue.

Retirees are decreasing tax revenue while simultaneously increasing spending. This is horribly broken and is currently a crisis. While it's easy to blame corporations, the wealthy, or whatever other villain your imagination can conjure the real crisis we're facing is simply old people.

So my young liberal friends why aren't you angry about this crisis? Both parties are ignoring it yet know it's the single biggest problem our government faces. The popular meme is that we're taxing the poor to give the rich when in reality we're taxing the young to give to the old.

[Wikipedia breakdown of govt spending in 2009](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_federal_budget)

TL;DR Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid take up 39% of the Federal Budget in 2009 and will continue to grow as the baby boomers retire.

politics,I'll play devil's advocate here on the tax issue.,"So, here goes.

First of all, the wealthiest already have a 35% federal income tax. Obviously that's not including the other bevy of taxes out there. Depending on the state, they could have be taxed within the vicinity of 50% of that income.

In the US at the end of 2001, the top 10% owned 71% of the national wealth. So that would mean that the top 10% already pays for the majority of our government's income.

So, if most of the wealth is in that top bracket, what they do is what governs our economy. When they're prosperous, we're prosperous. I'm not saying the trickle down effect works, because it doesn't. What does work is allowing the wealthy to keep on being wealthy. They are the people who make investments. How do companies get started? From people with money, whether it's a bank or a financial investor. The rich people make the economy run. As such, I'm okay with them not getting tax cuts.

But there's also the issue of our government being in one hell of a deficit. The easy solution certainly does seem to be ""tax the rich."" But I don't think it's the fairest. 

What I think needs to happen is more accountability for government finances. Even before 9/11, we were constantly losing hundreds and billions of dollars (if I recall, they announced the pentagon had a trillion dollars of funding that they didn't have track of). This should NOT happen. I'm not sure how the federal government does its accounting, but it doesn't work.

And, of course, we need to cut defense spending. The wars cost way too much and the American people doesn't get anything out of it. We aren't the world police. If people in the middle east want to kill each other, let them. All we need to do is maintain diplomatic relations so we can keep getting our cheap oil (though currently most of our oil comes from the US itself and Canada).",finance,2010-12-07,-0.2069952464918658

finance,How to pay off 3 loans with the least possible interest paid,"I'm starting to pay back student loans this month, and I have enough to cover the minimum payments, but I can also free up some extra money to pay them off sooner. Since I have 3 different loans, each with different interest rates, principals, minimum payments, and final payoff date, it seems like a tough problem to figure out the payment schedule that will cost me the least amount of interest.

In my research, I've found 2 popular methods for this situation:

* Pay off the highest interest rate loan first
* Pay off the lowest balance first

The second option seems like a bad idea unless I just wanted to have the good feeling of checking 1 loan off a list.

The first option seems pretty good, but I'm wondering: Once you've paid off a large amount of your highest interest loan, couldn't you accrue more interest on a lower interest loan with a higher balance?

I realize this is a really complicated question, but if all you can do is refer me to some research topics, that would be very helpful. I am not the most financially capable person around, even though I do have an okay background in math.

**tl;dr;** With a few different loans, where do you put extra money to minimize the amount of interest you will pay over the years?

If you guys need the numbers, I can give you the approximate values:

$5500 at 6.8% - 10 year -- $63.27 monthly payment

$2650 at 2.47% - 10 year -- $24.71 monthly

$2991 at 5.35% -- $50 monthly payment -- (no payoff date specified, but I think it's ~2 years)",finance,2010-12-07,-0.0090260835236183

First question - where do I move it? I don't believe in silver or gold. Cash will just loose it's value because of inflation and low interest rates. The only thing I can think of is real estate.

Thanks to all 9,082 (as of this writing) of you that upvoted my (perhaps overly) simple declaration. Thanks also to everyone who participated in the discussion below. The response has been overwhelming and you have all given me a lot to consider. I have some thoughts percolating about next steps and I'll post about that sometime in the next week. In the meantime, if anyone reading this has any actual political or legislative experience (ideally at the federal level), please message me. I have a few questions.

NOTES: 

* Many thanks to Bossman1086 for pointing out that a similar proposal was, in fact, almost the 11th amendment to the Constitution. [This article](http://soundingcircle.com/newslog2.php/__show_article/_a000195-000205.htm) says the amendment ""would have made it illegal for corporations to own other corporations, or to give money to politicians, or to otherwise try to influence elections"". Let's make it so!
* To those who may say this change can't be made; that the symbiotic relationship between government and corporations is just the way it is and can't be changed, I say: the symbiotic relationship between religion and government was ""just the way it was"" since time immemorial until the American founders changed things. We can do the same.
* Forget my previously proposed amendment (""Congress shall make no law designed to support or prohibit the activities of specific business entities or industries"") -- it was confusing the issue. Let me be clear: the intent of this proposal is to prevent corporations from currying favor with government.
* For those saying an amendment such as this would allow corporations to have free reign and do whatever they wish: no, you misunderstand the intent. This amendment would bar congress from passing laws aimed at *specific* companies and industries. Illegal activities (such as polluting, vandalism, larceny, etc) would obviously still be illegal and enforceable.
* Excellent question from anorexia_is_PHAT:
&gt; What would you propose for specific industries? If you make a blanket law that all companies must be regulated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, obviously most companies wouldn't need it. So either every company has to submit unneccessary paperwork to every single regulatory agency in existence, or the language of every regulatory agency's regulations has to have a bunch of ifs or cases to exclude companies that it obviously has no business regulating. Both of these would be messy and time-wasting.
   
    The short answer is: such an amendment to the constitution would in no way prevent the government from regulating potentially dangerous or harmful activities -- it would simply prevent the government from artificially propping up or unfairly persecuting specific businesses.
    For example, nuclear reactors are really dangerous and if you want to operate one you should have to jump through special hoops to do so. This would be true whether you're a corporation, non-profit organization, church or individual.
* pstryder says:
&gt; The amendment that will solve the problem is an amendment specifically worded to deny corporate personhood. Something along the lines of:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Only real, human persons are guaranteed these rights; these rights do not automatically apply to legal entities such as corporations, trusts, or any legal entity that is not a singular, real human person.""
* fswmacguy suggests: 
&gt; ""No representative shall be influenced by the interests of corporate power, and shall not receive unnecessary personal funding, under penalty of investigation, suspension, and indictment.""

    I applaud the sentiment, but ""no representative shall be influenced"" seems hard to quantify and enforce. This is a good start, though.
* ColonelPanix says:
&gt; I agree with you, 100%. I'd also add a constitutional provision that no government, Federal, state or local, can ever be a corporation.
 
   Good point. NotTheDude, rational1212 and Dragonshadow also pointed out the fact that our various governments and parties have themselves become corporate entities. Does this give anyone else a chilling feeling?
* Several folks have taken issue with use of the term ""Corporation"" and a focus on corporate personhood. Many valid points have been made and perhaps (as suggested by zylogz80) the focus should be on ""Separation of Commerce and State""
* To up the idealism ante, jakepin says:
&gt; ... I think we should propose an additional but supplemental amendment:
&gt; 
&gt; ""Representatives of the People, duly elected to serve in the Legislature or the Presidency, shall give up all rights to personal property in perpetuity, for as long as they shall live. They shall be provided domicile and sustenance by the United States but shall possess no property nor monies of their own, thereby freeing them to govern the affairs of Commerce in an unbiased manner.""
&gt; 
&gt; Having elected officials capable of participating in the free market they regulate/protect is like allowing football referees to bet on the games they officiate.

    I don't completely agree with it, but it's a fascinating suggestion. I do like the idea of a congress populated by leaders dedicated 100% to serving the people. That is, dedicated to the idea of a representative being a servant of the people, not a power broker well-positioned to fatten their own pockets.",finance,2010-12-08,-0.01051283085273

You sit on your computers and live each day very aware of the future your authoritarian overlords are handing you - you have the moment NOW to change these things - but the vast majority will simply allow things to pass. Things that will alter the course of this country and human kind as a whole for a great time to come.

With the mass censorship of Wikileaks - the giant failure to protect net neutraility - the allowance of a corrupt and invasive agency to treat other humans as cattle - and the undying loyalty our politicians give to support corporation interests over that of the people, we have given our future away.  

I am not here to advocate any group, any ideal, or any political party.  I'm here simply to make a plea - from one human to another.

Take back our future.  Arm your minds and sharpen your knowledge - we are a new age and we CAN fight back in our own ways.  Keep the internet free - we are VERY close to losing it.  Closer than you might want to believe.

In closing I make my plea to you reddit.  Don't accept this constructed reality we have been spoon fed since birth - a government is made up of people just like you and I.  We have the power for change - and I ask that you stand firm in your beliefs and your own ideals.  Question everything until the answers are brought to light.  I fear for those being born tomorrow - next year - next decade.  Their lives will be ultimately different based on the actions we take today.  Good luck and godspeed in your travels.

or 

**tl;dr** I'm mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.

Edit - To the three people who commented - thanks.  It is a relief knowing I'm not alone.  I wish I could get on TV an scream this to the world.  I know that isn't a reality - but it is something I am passionate about.  Thanks and hopefully these fears will never come to fruition.",technology,2010-12-08,0.0188388543311613

politics,I E-mailed VISA about WikiLeaks; this is the response I received.,"Let me start off by saying that it's pretty bland.

**My Original E-mail (I based this question off a previous thread here on reddit):**

I was wondering if somebody can explain something to me.

Why does VISA believe that it's okay to handle donations for a group supported by the KKK (whose aim is the overthrow of the US Government and the re-institution of the Confederacy) and makes you sign an allegiance to being a white racist before joining (http://i.imgur.com/0xiCl.png), but refuses to handle donations to WikiLeaks, an organization that has not had anyone charged with any crime relating to its business? 

I don't mean to be rude, but until I receive a reply, I will not be doing any business with VISA, nor will I recommend that anybody does.

Thank you for your time,
(castellammare)

**VISA's Response:**

Thank you for your inquiry. Visa appreciates our cardholders' feedback. Visa has temporarily suspended Visa payment acceptance on WikiLeaks' website pending investigation into whether it contravenes Visa Operating rules, including compliance with local laws in the markets where we operate.

Visa Webmaster

**My Reply:**

Hi,

Thank you for your feedback. However, I'm not sure if I completely understand your answer. Some things aren't particularly clear to me:

-Why wouldn't the investigation be completed first, before the suspension? Is this official VISA policy?

-If an investigation is completed, and it is concluded that WikiLeaks has done nothing to violated your Operating Rules, will Visa be giving any sort of compensation to WikiLeaks for lost business?

-Has an investigation been opened up into the Knights Party on whether they violate your Operating Rules?

-Has/will VISA suspended payment acceptance on the Knights Party until an investigation is complete?

Thank you for your time.

Sincerely,
(castellammare)

**Their Reply:**

Thank you for your inquiry. Visa sets high standards for all its products and services; however, the fact that a merchant displays the Visa logo or uses it on a Visa sales draft, does not indicate that Visa endorses the merchant, nor does it guarantee the quality of goods or services purchased from the merchant. 

To verify the legitimacy of a business, you may wish to contact local organizations such as trade licensing bureaus to inquire.

We hope this information is helpful.

Thank you for writing.

politics,What is it about Europeans that seems to allow them to have a more nuanced view on politics?,"Of course, this is a sweeping generalization. But, for the most part, the Europeans I know are simply baffled by crazy right-wing shit like the Tea Party, all of the American Christian fundamentalism/extremism, etc. Why is this?

I think it might be because of all the terrible shit that went down in Europe in the 20th Century – two World Wars, several genocides, the rise and fall of Communism, just to hit some of the highlights. They're taught in school never to forget.

In high school, I stayed with a German friend for a month, and everyday on the way to school we walked by the ruins of a bombed-out cathedral. They see this shit every day. But for Americans, the wars didn't happen here, and within a few years after they ended, we were back to prosperity. 

Most Americans have no appreciation for, and could give a shit about, the Great Depression and the reality at that time that no matter how much you tried to pull yourself up by your bootstraps, the state of the economy was such that it was simply impossible. Many honest, hardworking individuals gave their best effort and failed. 

But people have forgotten. The social safety net is a dirty word in American politics. *Welfare* has such a dirty ring to it that it's now only used in a disparaging context. The Europeans consciously think about the fact that old ways of thinking can be ineffective and even dangerous. The Industrial Revolution has fundamentally altered the ability of the average citizen to succeed financially. The horrors of the 20th century have taught the enlightened world the dangers of nationalism and military aggression.

Yet in American political discourse (at least in rhetoric), anything less than full blown capitalism coupled with blind patriotism is ""unamerican."" Socialism is a disease. Discretion in war is ""being a pussy like the French."" Americans just don't learn.

John Dewey wrote: ""Things are justified or condemned by their consequences, not by their antecedents."" Guess what Americans! Those socialist wimps over in Europe have higher standards of living and generally higher levels of happiness than us. There is nothing in your Bible that tells you capitalism and patriotism are immutable requirements for a good society. (In fact, Jesus said just the opposite, but that's entirely different story.) We can't continue to label things with a dirty word as a means of dismissing new policy ideas. The world has changed, and this Humeian philosophy of maintaining the status quo is dangerous. The world is constantly throwing new threats our way, and the right wing in America thinks they can throw their Bible and their Wealth of Nations at the problem as if the rest of the world isn't disgusted by the arrogance and ignorance of such a perspective.

American civics classes need to teach more context. Why did we adopt the Bill of Rights? Because the anti-federalists were scared shitless that the new national government would be as tyrannical as the biggest monarch.

Well, what's the biggest threat to people today? It's not governmental tyranny, but corporate tyranny. And yet deregulation and corporate tax breaks are the hallmarks of good Republican politics. 

And don't even get me started on what Jefferson or Madison would say about the state of executive and military power in modern America. 

The point is, we've lost sight of reality. A lot of the rest of the world sees it. We need to take a step back, and reevaluate our commitment to ignorance and arrogance in the face of potential progress.",finance,2010-12-10,-0.3344466438435255

1. Bond interest rates are a measure of the market's belief that a government won't default on the bond.
2. Ireland spent a lot of money bailing out its banks.
3. In order to save Ireland from defaulting on its debt because it spent all its money bailing out its banks, Germany gave Ireland a bunch of money. *What was Germany's incentive for bailing out Ireland? Somehow, because they're both part of the Euro,  Ireland's defaulting on its debts would affect Germany -- how? Do Irish bond rates affect German bond rates? Other German interest rates?*
4. Germany may leave the Euro so as not to have to bail out other profligate states in the Euro. In this event, the revived Deutschmark, being the currency of an austere creditor state, would attract lots and lots of capital from the Euro, dollar, etc.  This would cause the DM to go up relative to the Euro, meaning the debts Euro zone countries owe Germany get cheaper, which is bad for Germany.
5. Ireland may leave the Euro because if they had their own currency, all this uncertainty regarding Irish debt would simply drop the value of the currency as bond rates go up *(is this really how it works? why do rising bond rates make a currency drop?)*. A dropping currency means cheaper exports, spurring growth and capital inflow, generating cash for the Irish government, and thereby fixing Ireland's debt problem.

Economics,/r/econ - I think that the unimproved land value tax is the best form of taxation and should be used to fund all governments. Let's debate this.,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax

I suggest a tax that ignores the value of improvements upon land, and levies the tax on site value only. Funding for services on a municipal, state and federal level should be levied within each agency's boundaries on a flat per-square-foot basis. If the tax on a parcel of land exceeds its value, the government will foreclose on the tax lien and own the land, just as what happens today.

I like this tax because:

*  it is one of the only forms of taxation that has no deadweight loss. 
* It encourages the improvement of land, which doesn't really happen under today's property tax system because landowners are essentially penalized for making land more valuable. So, levy a ground rent only, and solve this problem.
* It is nearly impossible to evade the tax.
* It is progressive, as the wealthy own a disproportionate amount of land.

I'd like to hear some other viewpoints on this. Thus far, the only popular tax proposals have been for a flat tax and a national sales tax, both of which I find unsavory. But no one ever mentions the relative strengths of the land value tax.",finance,2010-12-11,0.0033112762384846

Economics,"How the rich get richer and the poor stay poor: a simple example of how debt works, and why it matters at every level","This principle comes up over and over again, sometimes in stupid ways, and it applies to everything from personal finance to trade deficits, so here goes:

- Imagine a world where it costs approximately one dollar per year to live, and where every job pays a one dollar per year salary (just to keep the math simple)

- I am rich, and have 100 dollars. I lend out a dollar to each of 100 people, who in turn agree to pay me 10 cents per year in flat interest (again, to keep the math simple).

- Each of those people earns one dollar per year, and pays me ten cents of that dollar, never paying off the balance. 

- Every year, I earn $10 from the interest payments, while each of my debtors earns only 90 cents after their payment to me, with no end in sight. 

- Those who try to ""pay off"" their debt, by paying an extra penny per year, earn only 89 cents per year, and pay me 11 cents per year. After 100 years, they will have paid off the debt at one penny per year against the principal and ten cents per year interest, for a total of $11 dollars paid to me for the dollar I originally loaned them. If every borrower did this, after 100 years I (or, more likely, my estate) would have $1100 from my original $100 investment. 

- Even better for me, if I had been re-investing that $10 per year that I was earning in interest by lending it out to other borrowers, I would rapidly compound my returns and be earning $100 per year *just in interest payments*.

This is how the rich get richer and the poor stay poor (or get poorer). It is essentially by being on either the right side or the wrong side of interest rates. 

If you want to get rich, find a way to make income through ownership instead of wages. Own land, own a business, own intellectual property, own loans, whatever. Get out of the practice of selling off your life one hour at a time, and get into the practice of collecting from people who want the use of your business, land, intellectual property, or capital. 

Landlords pay a fixed sum (or more commonly, a fixed mortgage payment) while their tenants pay inflation-adjusted rent. Your landlord, if she bought the property today, might be paying $1,000 per month in mortgage and expenses on your apartment, and collecting from you $1,000 in rent. Which seems like a pretty bad deal except that 30 years from now, she'll be collecting maybe $5,000 per month in rent (after 30 years of inflation), while making her final $1,000 mortgage payment, at which point she'll own the building free and clear, while you'll still be paying $5,000 per month with no end in sight. 

This is why China can spend $50bn on building the world's fastest railroads without a second thought while Obama must fight to try and get $3bn to explore high-speed passenger rail in the US. China is collecting a trillion dollars per year or whatever in interest payments from the US, so what do they care about such expenses that will only increase their competitive advantage and future income? 

This is also why things like the US *trade* deficit are a much bigger deal than the more-ballyhooed government debt. The US gov't borrowed heavily to win the cold war. Then it started borrowing again to finance the current war on terror. It's also been borrowing since, to keep the country running, rightly or wrongly. 

Any of those might have been good or bad decisions, but they are the equivalent of the family farm borrowing to pay for equipment and so on. It may have been done wisely or unwisely, but it can be, and eventually will be, paid back from the proceeds of the farm.

However, the current accounts (read mostly ""trade"") deficit is the equivalent of selling off the family farm an acre at a time. When the family itself is spending more than it earns, when the kids and grandkids are all selling off their claims on the family farm in exchange for new cars and apartments in the city, then we are not just borrowing against future crops, but permanently handing over the acreage that will pay our future incomes. 

This is why things like wage and currency discrepancies matter, even if pure free-market thought experiments say they should not. In an abstract model of a free market, all market actors are equal. But in the real world they are not. Workers in some parts of the world are artificially made more desperate than workers in other parts of the world, and the equilibrium of intelligence and free action is far from perfect. 

This means that a pseudo-""free"" and unregulated market will, in the present, result in a massive and unearned transfer of wealth from those who are at or above equilibrium to those who are below equilibrium. Which might be okay, in the long run, if wages were all we had to worry about.

To frame a crude but not entirely inaccurate analogy, when a country like the US trades with a country like China, it is akin to a family farm trading with a neighboring farm that occasionally kills off some of the grandkids once their crops are harvested. The farm that is keeping its ""currency"" artificially low in this way is able to claim more from the farm that continues to feed the whole family. The ""unfair"" farm is able to sell, at cut-rate prices, their own crops to the un-slaughtered grandkids of the ""fair"" farm in exchange for a small piece of the ""fair"" farm, cheaper than those heirs could grow for themselves. 

This is a much bigger deal for the family than the farm itself borrowing to pay for new equipment or even current operations, because it permanently degrades the earning capacity of the farm. 

It is also, and this is important, categorically different from selling off or converting acres of the farm to better economic use. That is, the family is not building apartments on under-used farmland, nor renting it out or selling it to parking lots or stadiums or windmills or fairgrounds or shopping malls or whatever. Nor are they succumbing to genuine economic pressures of farms that are more-efficient in terms of creating greater genuine wealth in terms of net human benefit. 

Similarly, and just as importantly, the problem of trade deficits is not merely a problem of the farm that is willing to chop up the grandkids and use them as fertilizer once they have grown the apples being able to sell them cheaper to other customers in the marketplace. **The problem is that, when we are trading our produce for theirs on ""equal"" terms, they are gaining ownership of our farm with every transaction.** 

It is very important to understand that **the above is not an argument for protectionism.** Propping up inefficient industries (farms or otherwise) is just as bad, and breeds corrosion from within, by crippling the strong. To extend the analogy, the family farm would be badly-served if it tried to divert fertilizer and acreage from the grandkid who was profitably growing corn to the grandkid who can't get apples to grow. Similarly, the family farm is better off buying tractors and tools from efficient producers in town than they are trying to mine and smelt their own iron ore and machine their own engines and so on. 

The problem is a specific one of **willingly giving up long-term economic assets** to trading partners with artificially (not economically) lower costs. 

It's like borrowing from a drug dealer. If he is able to finance your lifestyle cheaper because of the fact that he stole the assets instead of creating them, then it is no longer a wealth-generating activity to trade with him. On a one-case-at-a-time basis it might hardly matter that you got a cheap watch or playstation from him, but when the whole family is financing a lifestyle by selling off pieces of the farm in exchange for stolen watches and playstations, then we are no longer talking about market efficiencies. 

I use the example of the US and China because I expect it has the most relevance to the largest number of redditors, but the exact same analogies could be used with say, Europe and Africa. Africa is probably the richest continent in terms of natural resources, but the nature of its trade relationships is such that most of that wealth is simply extracted. This creates a sort of dutch disease where genuine economic growth cannot take hold, because the local currency is inflated by the value of the natural resources to the point where it is not cost-effective to set up any other industry than extraction. 

Which comes back to the original concept of ownership. **Whether you are getting richer or poorer in the long run always ultimately depends on which side of the ownership line you are on.** Nobody can stay poor for too long if they are on the right side of ownership, and nobody can stay rich for too long if they are trading ownership for current consumption.",finance,2010-12-11,-0.0240836374305628

politics,A proposal to fight gerrymandering corruption and reduce partisanship in Congress: voters in each state should adopt a ballot-based constitutional amendment banning gerrymandering and requiring the use of unbiased computer algorithms to draw districts for both state and federal offices.,"I personally view gerrymandering as one of the largest areas of open and shameless corruption in the United States political system. The fact that it still happens is disgusting and it definitely has a negative effect on the country's politics by encouraging more partisanship, since the whole point of gerrymandering is to eliminate competition in particular districts by making it either extremely Democratic or extremely Republican. Partisanship is breaking this country and this may be one of the few things that voters can do to reduce partisanship. If districts are more competitive, then fewer extremists can make their way into Congress.

For those that want more background: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#United_States

Redistricting is going to be happening shortly due to the 2010 census. Last time, things got completely out of hand. We really need to stop bullshit like [Tom Delay's breaking up of Austin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:TravisCountyDistricts.png). There are many examples all over the country of heavily gerrymandered districts. And both parties are guilty of this practice. Unfortunately, it is too late to stop gerrymandering this time around, but if we start a movement, things can be different for the 2020 census.

A good way to fix this is to use computers to draw the districts using algorithms such as shortest splitline. The algorithms should be reviewed by bodies of technical experts such as the American Political Science Association, the National Academy of Science/Engineering, IEEE, ACM, etc. and approved by the Government Accountability Office and/or state-level, NGO, or third party auditors. Of course, the algorithms and their implementations should be open source to ensure that no secret tricks or biases are planted in them.

Here is an overview of algorithmic techniques:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gerrymandering#Objective_rules_to_create_districts
* http://rangevoting.org/GerryExamples.html

To implement this, I think following the example of the [National Popular Vote Compact](http://www.nationalpopularvote.com/) is the way to go. Voters in each state that are fed up with partisanship should use their ballot-based constitutional amendment process to require computer-based redistricting. I believe it should be possible to get a majority of voters in each state to agree that Gerrymandering is ridiculous and needs to be defeated.",technology,2010-12-12,-0.191819177964146

politics,What the TEA party movement is and is not.,"There's been a great deal of TEA party movement hate going on in this subreddit, so I'm just dropping in to set things straight, and debunk all the lies and rhetoric.  Here's what the TEA party movement is:

T.E.A. is an acronym that stands for Taxed Enough Already.   It's a reference to the 1773 Boston Tea Party (for those who don't know/care, this is when people got fed up with the amount of taxation being imposed upon them).

The modern TEA part movement is very diverse in it's views, but everyone part of the movement is united by one belief:  **We want lower taxes, which by definition means lower government spending**.

Literally, that's it.  **This is the only belief that characterizes us as a group.**

We are not racist.
We are not religious nuts.
We are not extemists.
We are not X, if X =/= fed up with the high taxes.

Why do people say mean things about us?  Because they don't want lower taxes.  Why don't they want lower taxes?

Here's the answer to the second question.  There's a couple of reasons why people are opposed to the TEA party movement.

1) The way the tax system works in this country is that **APPROXIMATELY** the top 10% (plus/minus 9% or so) of income earners subsidize the bottom 90%.  If you are in the bottom 90%, and you don't have the desire/ability to make it to the top 10%, you would logically be against this movement, because you'd be supporting a party who wants to take away your subsidies.

2) You are part of the top 10%, but you are a collectivistic person who believes that those who have a lot, should pitch in, to help the less fortunate.  These people, despite having lots of money, believe in redistributing wealth, so to speak, in order to help the most number of people possible.

So excluding those who fall into category 2, it's all about greed right? Trying to take as much as you can if you are poor, and trying to hoard as much as you can if you are rich?  Not quite.

Now why do TEA party members think that they are right and the people in category 2 are wrong?  Economics.  Economics predicts that the free market is the best system for everyone, which by definition means lower taxes.  Since WW2, the free market has slowly been disappearing, which correlates with the fall of the USA's total percentage of the world's GDP.  After WW2, the USA alone counted for about half of the world's total GDP.  Now we're down to about a quarter.  Based on evidence like this, it makes sense that what we're doing over the last 50 years or so (destruction of the free market and higher taxes) hasn't been working.  I'm not going to go into detail here, but just take my word for it (Or read up on economics 101 yourself)

But basic economic theory also predicts that by letting the rich have their money, some of it will ""trickle down"" to the poor.  So everybody wins in this scenario.  Although it is the indirect route to helping the poor (as opposed to the direct route of redistribution of wealth)... the TEA party members believes it is the best way.  For example, letting the rich have more money will cause them to put up more businesses, which will create more high paying jobs with more benefits.

So in summary, the TEA party members are not selfish.  We believe that by lowering taxes (which by definition means bringing back the free market and cutting spending), that not only we will benefit directly, but those with less money will benefit indirectly.  We don't believe that the directness of a benefit means anything with regards to how good the benefit is.  It's a win-win!

So to our haters.  Please don't pin false beliefs on us, like that we want to remove separation of church and state, that we are racist, etc.  It's simply not true.  We don't call you all communists or facists, so we expect the same in return.  Now that this has all been cleared up, let's try to keep the debate classy.

politics,Harness the Hivemind and create our own change we can believe in!,"I've been thinking: **the way for people to reclaim control over our federal government is through an internet based interest group.** Think about this: using the Reddit hivemind, people can divide and conquer political research. Various members research out candidates that support the hive's political ideology and statistical chances at winning. 

1. Using our mass resources, we can target these particular, key elections and primaries with our votes and money. Voter registration and turnout to elections will be requirements to joining.

2. As far as sorting out ideology and debate, a Reddit style voting system can be used to help discuss topics and where to concentrate our resources. All of our political decisions - what our political goals are, which elections to support and vote for, etc would be voted on by our members. Highly controversial subjects will be ignored and saved for a later time; topics that we have consensus in will be pushed to the most importance. 

3. Members, through karma and community incentives, will research out different politicians. The work will be divided across hundreds (maybe thousands) of members so the work will not be overwhelming. Politicians' ideology and integrity will be thoroughly analyzed and stored for public record. 

4. Once we reach a decision internally on a matter, *all* of us must vote that way in the election and primaries. Obviously this cannot be enforced because of secret ballot, but members will be strongly encouraged to vote as a powerful collective. And if all of our decisions are reached through democratic consensus and compromise, ""turncoats"" would be kept to a minimum.

5. Our interest group will not vote merely on national elections. Through our *largeness*, we will be able to research local and state politicians and thus have great influence in those arenas too. This is probably the most important thing, our influence in local politics. We will never be able to aim for federal politics when we cannot even influence locally. By sorting through the ridiculous amounts of candidates - judges, prosecutors, mayors, etc., we can make more efficient use of our time by relying on the hivemind to help categorize candidates rather than independently taking time to research them ourselves. Seriously, how can anyone expect to be informed about 20-40+ local/state/federal political candidates without a little bit of division of labor? 

6. This is not about making a Democratic Party lapdog. The Dems have made it clear they don't give a shit about plenty of things we care about. This is about forcing both Democratic and Republican candidates to promise our interest group various interests in exchange for our large, powerful vote. 

The US Congress is happy to ignore the 18-30 Reddit demographic because we have no power. We're not in any interest groups (yet). We don't vote enough. Our power is not concentrated enough. Well, is anyone interested? Are you tired of bitching about politics and actually want the ability to change some things??

It's time to make our own interest group, and finally seize some power for ourselves. It's time to unite and make some things happen. If we cannot have true democracy in our federal government, it's time to make our own democracy.",cryptocurrency,2010-12-14,-0.0024360324688323

The series as a whole is my favorite game, and i don't mean that in a ""L4D2 was an expansion"" way, just L4D/2 in general is my favorite, that is all.

Both are terrific games and when 2 came out I still played the original on a constant basis. Problem is my team was caught in the original only side, and never found a strong group on two that I liked talking to along with playing. By the time my old buddies got 2 they were out of the loop on what was going on and all the new tactics and strategies to be employed on both sides and they soon there after stopped playing all together. the community on both sides doesn't seem to have nearly the strength that it use to. So I stopped playing for quite some time. Now I'm back and there seems to a fraction of the people playing.

I hope these great games can endure!

Hit me up if you just want to play a great fucking game. (either one)

A friend and I were talking, and we were discussing how many tax cut such as the Bush tax cuts should have been accompanied by a national sales tax of 1 to 2% on top of state sales tax. Given that people are taxed less on their income, when it comes to consumption, money goes back to the federal government. He mentioned that any tax cut to the wealthy of the magnitude of the original Bush tax cuts should have been followed by a system like this.

What does everyone think of this system? What are the pros and cons?

We all know how hard it is to let a tax cut expire once it's already been in effect. People seem to support a sales tax locally if it is linked to infrastructure, building schools, etc..., so I think people could be more forgiving on a national sales tax.",finance,2010-12-16,-0.0099918210877444

B. is what he has as the answer on our key. I don't get how the price level affects the supply of dollars in the foreign currency exchange market.

EDIT:
I figured it out, a decrease in the price level leaves makes individuals money relatively more valuable. Because of this, they have more money to save by purchasing bonds/stocks. This increase in saving lowers the interest rate. Because the interest rate is lower, investment abroad is more appealing, so net capital outflow raises, while net exports remains unchanged.

Economics,Price inflation != Monetary inflation,"We are seeing inflation, only the end result isn't that our prices increase, it's that national banks have disproportionately more money.

I continue to see folks in this sub-reddit state that because we aren't seeing prices increase that there is no inflation. That couldn't be further from the truth.

The equation for total inflation usually accounts for something called the ""velocity of money"" in addition to the amount of money in supply. Right now, the Fed and bankers are trying to compensate for a very low velocity of money by increasing supply. What this means is that when the velocity of money returns to regular levels, actual price inflation will occur, and there are many, including myself, that think this has the **potential** to lead to hyper-inflation. This does not mean that it will. In fact, it could be argued that extremely high interest rates (double-digits) could combat this, if necessary.

I just wanted to mention this, because ""hyperinflation"" gets tossed about like it's something that certain particular economists are all predicting is going to happen when it is only the potential of it happening that most are worried about. We (meaning the US public) shouldn't even get to a position where we are considered at-risk, which is why we shouldn't have bailed out banks and why this monetary ""easing"" and QE2 are, IMHO, bad.

Sorry if you are not looking for a US-centric view, but I'm trying to explain this to several of the teens and maybe non-econ college kids that seem to only have a cursory understanding of what inflation is.",finance,2010-12-17,-0.1986419022690399

politics,We have to question whether terrorism is a real threat at all.,"It's fairly obvious that the Taliban are waging a nuanced and calculated war effort in Afghanistan.

It's also fairly obvious that for all their differences, Al-Qaeda is in bed with the Taliban and they coordinate their efforts somewhat.

It's also fairly obvious, going by Bin Laden's speeches, or popular opinion among interviewed Taliban members, that their goal is to replicate Vietnam (America's version of Russia's Afghanistan). To wage a guerilla war while sapping the will of America to fight. The Taliban may be many things, but they are not stupid. A stupid enemy could not have achieved to date, what they have in Afghanistan, against the combined forces of several dozen countries.

It's also fairly obvious that each and every overseas terrorist attack or attempt undermines their entire war effort by doing the opposite of sapping their enemy's will to fight.

It stands to reason that perhaps some of these attempts are fake to begin with, to not inflict damage, but to strike terror into people's hearts and get the security situation domestically to get out of control and get everyone pissed at their own government. Let's not get into that.

Any actual attack, like the 9/11 attacks (which many in Afghanistan and among the Taliban still don't believe Al-Qaeda was responsible for), would only wind up injecting new life into the American war effort. It would make the possibility of an American withdrawal all the more unlikely. There's a reason so many people blamed the US government for 9/11, and that reason exists moreso now than ever, especially since we have Wikileaks cables from the past year detailing NATO's acknowledgement that it needs to win a propaganda war at home to drum up support for the war effort in Afghanistan.

In this climate, how the hell could Al-Qaeda possibly pull off a terrorist attack on US soil without royally pissing off everyone in the Taliban all the way to Mullah Omar himself? Al-Qaeda is fighting for its life in Pakistan, all but eliminated from Afghanistan. It's waging an actual war of terror in Pakistan, as evidenced by many of the bombings, and it's not the only participant (Pakistani government's recent assertions that it has concrete evidence that foreign governments are waging their own proxy terror wars in the country... sounds like a conspiracy theory, except this was real during the late '80s and Pakistan lost its President in the midst of it... it stands to reason it could happen again). If you want to see an actual war *of* terror, look no further than Pakistan. Is that happening in the US? 

No? Then what's stopping it from happening? Certainly not our security.

Recently there was a submission to reddit detailing how the TSA was hugely ineffective at stopping bombs and guns from getting through security (some Iranian man brought a gun through security and on his flight). The TSA had almost a 90% failure rate in some airports, and easily over 50% at LAX or Chicago's O'Hare in these tests conducted by undercover federal agents.

The top commenter said this was proof positive that we really are not under the threat of attack.

Let this sink in for a moment. There is no war on terror. There is a war in Afghanistan, and as we've just shown, in order for the other side to win that war, it is in their best interests that no successful terrorist attack goes off in the United States.

All these recent arrests in the US are cases of the FBI sending out fake terrorists to try and recruit anyone possible. And by recruit, I mean entrap. Who's to say the CIA cannot do this same thing overseas? Or that it hasn't already? Being that, you know, it seems like its right up their alley.

The Pentagon has only one camera and five frames of film documenting the attack. The Pentagon does not need a full audit. The Federal Reserve does not need a full audit. An independent Federal Reserve is essential for price control and full employment. If QE 1 and QE 2 don't revive the economy QE 3 and QE 4 most likely will. There's no danger from the Fed increasing their balance sheet 250% in a couple years. The stock market is not manipulated by front-running high-speed computers. The banks are working to help save you from foreclosure. Austerity will liberate workers and reduce the national debt. Banks, hedge funds and bondholders must be repaid 100 cents on the dollar to ensure economic recovery. Social Security needs to be cut to rein in the deficit. Social security is broke when you discount the $2 trillion surplus and tens of millions of workers currently paying in. Medicare is despised by a majority of the country, humiliates senior citizens and may be taken over by the government. Getting IMF'ed is not going to be painful. The GAO has conclusively proven that single payer is the most costly health care delivery method by never providing an estimate. The media is controlled by liberals. A consolidated media is not a threat to democracy. The public airwaves do not need to be regulated. Handing the internet over to self-regulated telcos will assure neutrality. Assange is a terrorist. Assange is a rapist. Assange is a terrapist. Bradley Manning is a villain. Maintaining an ever growing empire and a flourishing democracy at home is very likely. Bloggers aren't real journalists who use facts and reason to draw conclusions.

Whoever controls the media controls the country. Period.

Economics,"So how much for each butcher, baker, prostitute, lawyer and priest? (Crosspost from askreddit)","According to [Fed Bank](http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/graph/?s[1][id]=M3) there was $10.3 Trillion in total actual money available as of 2006. World population was [6,543,713,248](http://www.google.com/publicdata?ds=wb-wdi&amp;met=sp_pop_totl&amp;tdim=true&amp;dl=en&amp;hl=en&amp;q=population+of+earth).

I know its simplistic but if you have a village of 5 people (a butcher, a baker, a prostitute, a lawyer and a priest), money supply of $1000 and each just happen to earn $200 a year income. If one of the villagers, lets say the baker decides to increase his income by charging an extra 10% he then gets $220 and the rest $195. The other 4 then increase their rates to pay for the extra cost of the bread. This leads to inflation and people asking for credit to pay for increased costs, because they all cant be on $220 ea if theres only $1000 available, right? So whats the point of economic growth if all you ever wanted was a loaf of bread?

**Update:** Doesnt it also mean that if one of the villagers over time accumulates $800 in wealth, the most each of the others can have is $50?",finance,2010-12-21,-0.0474499464035034

If those accounts averaged $1,000, that's $1million, or not even half of one millionth of BoA's total assets.

Besides, we're targeting one bank, not all. We're voting with our dollars. We're going to allow ethical companies to handle our money.

**EDIT 3:** I have no affiliation with any other bank. I'm just a BoA customer who's taking his money out on January 15th because of all the reprehensible actions of BoA.

Economics,Income Tax Overhaul Idea,"I am one of those that believe that the wealthy should pay a higher tax rate incrementally.  I don't believe in the trickle down effect and I would personally be affected by this type of change but I think it is necessary.  Obviously the uber-wealthy have a lot of control either personally or via corporations and most of the time are able to influence the lawmakers.  I also feel that the average american feels that their individual votes are pretty worthless.  I came up with an idea on how to make the system more fair and not having a strong background in economics I would be interested in hearing opinions of why this would or would not be a good idea:

Currently each individual pays federal income tax.  The government sets the rate at which those taxes are levied.  What if instead of having individuals pay federal taxes, each state as a whole paid the federal taxes.  The government could set the same percentage for each state, say 40% of total personal income (or % of GDP or some other measure) so that proportionately each state pays the same based on some metric.  This would be higher than the current average.  Each state could then set their own rules for how that is collected.  One state could say that anything over a million dollars is taxed at 80% for the individual while another could say there is a flat 40% across the board.  States that are doing poorly could therefore create greater tax incentives to bring in industry or give tax breaks to lower income individuals where needed.  People also always state that if so-and-so happens they will move to another country, which for most is unrealistic, but it is not so unlikely that people would move to another state.  This would put a lot of pressure on the local government to actually listen to their local constituencies.  In states with a disproportionately large number of wealthy people it would be harder for them to get their selfish agendas passed than it is on a national level.  It would also mean that we would end up having hard evidence of which systems are the most successful as several would be happening at the same time with measurable results.

Obviously I can only personally hash this out so far but I would love any insight or thoughts.

Economics,Can the Fed Ever Permanently Increase the Base?,"I hesitate to ask this question in this forum, as I'm not certain there are any actual economists in here. I'm not looking for the conspiracy theories about the evil Fed answer, I'm looking for the PhD in Economics answer.

I've been reading my Mishkin Money &amp; Banking textbook, and this is how I understand that the Fed increases the money supply. The FOMC buys, for example, $100 in US gvt. securities on the open market using new money. That $100 is now in the banking system and is expanded to, let's say, $1000 using the magic of fractional reserve banking. That $1000 is in private loans, though. So, eventually money comes in from elsewhere in the economy to retire that $1000 in loans. The only permanent increase seems to be the +$100 to the base. But, that too is a sort of loan to the government which is paid off at a set point in time. So, as I understand it, at some point there would be a -$100 from the US account at the Fed matched with a -$100 to the Fed's balance of government securities. Does this not leave us back at square one?

This model omits interest payments and the Treasury's issuance of coins, but I have to assume that the Fed somehow has the ability to increase the money supply permanently, independent of those two factors. The private sector creates value, and if the money supply does not expand to match said value, it seems deflation would occur.

I know I'm missing something simple. Please someone set me straight. Again, if all you know about the Fed comes from a video you downloaded on the Internet, keep your comments to yourself. Thanks!",finance,2010-12-26,0.0282150779305616

* Health care would probably be handled better at a state level as the state representatives know their constituents well and would be able to craft a system that would better please them.

* If people from Alabama don't want socialized health care, why should people from California be able to force it upon them just because they want it?  The federal government is suppose to represent the entire nation, and it's hard to support something that half the country doesn't want.

* The federal program Medicare essentially gave old people what they want, and now that they have it, they don't feel the need to help anyone else.  So now the entire nation is taxed to support the largest voting group that doesn't want to share the goods.  Not only does this make it harder to enact socialized health care for everyone at a federal level, but it is also harder for states to justify enacting socialized health care as their constituents would be double taxed at both the state and federal level to support it.

*  The domino effect.  When a few states start socializing their health care, the rest will follow.  To socialize health care at a federal level, there needs to be a huge catalyst to overcome the opposition, but at a state level, each time a state socializes it's health care, that is another mini catalyst for the state's nearby.

* Many people believe that health care should be dealt with at a state level and that it is unconstitutional at a federal level.  

* Let's reverse the scenario:  many people think that the government shouldn't be involved at all and that the free market can handle it.  Fine, if they want that, then let them test it out in their state.  Do you think people on the other side of the country who don't share your values or ideals should be able to force this theory upon you?  Because liberals have made this a federal issue by supporting programs like medicare/medicaid, arguments like this shall also be brought up in defense at the federal level.

Note: *This is all under the assumption that socialized health care actually improves our country/health care system, an assumption that must be made*

.............

As you might be able to tell, I don't support socialized health care at a federal level, but I completely support States that decide to take control of the health care of their citizens.  Also, I'm a strong supporter of state's rights and think that if state's would handle health care, then it would reduce the size and bloat of the federal government.  The States would all try different methonds as to create the perfect system.  Instead, we live in a society where all the states rely on the federal government and take no responsibility.  It sets a poor precedent for the federal government and gives it power not granted to it.

I think that LBJ thought that the ""foot in the door"" technique for passing medicare would eventually lead to completely socialized health care, but I think it greatly backfired.  There is no doubt in my mind that if the federal government never got involved, that our health care system, and country in general, would be much better off.

Also, please note any spelling/grammar errors so I can correct them.",energy,2010-12-28,-0.0457734760211894

hardware,Let's build my mom a PC from the parts we have sitting around!,"If my going on is too much for you, skip to the line **So this is what I want to do:** below. If that it too long still, skip to the **tl;dr**.  If that is too long still, then I apologize, brevity has never been one of my talents.

A little over a year ago, after she had gone without a computer for years, I decided to give my mom my laptop.  I am her only child and I live 600 miles away, so I wanted her to be able to use it to stay in touch the way we do in this modern age (with our fancy gadgets and social networking) and to have a way to keep up with my kids.  She took to it very well, keeping up with the grandkids from a distance by watching videos and pics, and branching out to reconnect with other friends and family.


Problem is, about two months ago, it died.  Though she has internet service, she has no computer.  Every time I speak to her, she mentions that she misses being connected like she had been.  My kids are growing up fast.  So, I want that for her pretty bad.


I started to buy her something new for Christmas, but by that time I had had my eyes opened by the power of a community of good-hearted and creative people and I got a better idea:


My mom is a person who gives for others to the point where I get uncomfortable with how much she's given.  But that is precisely how she would have it--its how she rolls:  


She's of retirement age but has no retirement nest egg to carry her, so, she spends her time in community service as an Americorps VISTA volunteer, and living off of the small stipend that it brings.  In August, my father passed away, and in that she lost both her partner, but an income.  So, in the financial department, she's just getting by.  


Surprisingly though, she's content with that:  she makes enough to eat, and taking part in, or witnessing the process of people doing good things is much more valuable to her than having ""nice things.""


She's also what you might call a ""junker.""  She likes to find things that other people threw out and to do something valuable (at least, to her) with them.  For example, she once ""rescued"" a toilet that a neighbor had left for the trash pickup and made it into a planter!  Sometimes it works more in theory than in practice, but it is part of the spirit of what I am trying to do here.


Putting all that together defines the spirit of my idea.  A month ago, I will admit, I was a fed up Digg lurker who checked out Reddit because it was obvious that was where everyone was going.  It took a little getting used to, but it didn't take long to realize that what goes on here transcends  ""reputation,"" news articles and internet memes.  This is a community of people who, for the most part, want to do good things.  That aspect of Reddit was not something that I expected--it is much appreciated food for the soul.  Combining that with the kind of person I know her to be, I am excited at the possibility of showing her what happens when you mix the power of the internet with the power of good people.  The result could be both a fun, creative solution to my problem (get mom a computer so she can keep up with grandkids) and a joyful, well timed, and moving experience for her--because it is precisely what I have seen happen here on Reddit that she believes in to her core.


**So here's what I want to do:**


I want to build my mom a PC using parts we Redditors have sitting around.  


Before we go there, I appreciate any offers to go out and purchase awesome things, but part of the spirit would be lost in doing so.  


I have a 500GB SATA hard drive, a copy of Windows 7, a technical aptitude and the willingness to pay the cost to ship to me.  I need to obtain the rest, and I am hoping that I can do that with your help.  That entails the following (and feel free to add if I left something out or you think it would be useful):

* Motherboard
* Case
* Power Supply
* Processor(s)
* Memory
* Video Card
* Monitor
* Speakers
* Reddit Sticker or Reddit branding of some kind.  After all, this will be a Reddit PC.  


I have built PCs before, but it was back when RAM had to be paired in twos (a looong time ago, don't laugh).  So, I also need help in ensuring that these items will work together.  


The best way I can think to evaluate any options that we have (and to choose what items to use) is to do the following:


If you have a motherboard that you would like to add, start a NEW comment thread by replying to my post.  Each comment thread will represent a PC build and the motherboard will serve as its root.


If you have a non-motherboard item to contribute, and it is appropriate for the build, respond to the motherboard comment.


So each potential build will be represented by a comment thread, with motherboards at the root, and components as the first level.


The build thread and each component comment within that thread with the highest vote count will be our build.   I will accept as many components, additions, enhancements, etc. that are part of that build but are not duplicated or unusable.


So, if you have something to contribute, feel free to comment on multiple threads if the component is appropriate for it.


Feel free to discuss and or interject your creativity wherever you feel it is appropriate.  I want this to be fun!


I want it to work too!  So, if you have knowledge of computer parts, their quality, and their compatibility, please incorporate that into your choice of whether to upvote. 


After 24 hours, assuming we have a winning build, I will PM folks about shipping and we will go from there.  


If this works out, I will document the whole thing and post it in a separate thread.  My plan is to send it to her without an explanation other than the URL shortcuts on her desktop:  A link to this thread and a link to the post documenting the process.  


Thank you for reading, but if you didn't....


**tl;dr**: My mom is a great person who has had a hard year.  She needs a PC, can't afford one, and loves when something useful can be made from ""junk.""  So, I'm asking for Reddit to volunteer their parts, so we can build her a PC from what we would otherwise have casted aside. Shipping costs are on me.

**EDIT:**  Removed sound and network cards from the list since TIL they are usually onboard these days. *feeling old*

**UPDATE [12/28/10 11:23PM Central]:**  Remarkably, you generous folks have offered up about every piece of the puzzle so far, but it remains to be seen whether it will or should all work together, for sure.  Here is the status so far:

* Motherboard:  ASUS P5Q SE PLUS, offered by dave_casa
* Processor:  Intel Core 2 Quad 9550, offered by dave_casa 
* Memory:  2GB PC6400, offered by sedo1800
* Video Card:  Either NVidia 8600 GT or 9600GT, offered by simnol
* Monitor:  Dell 19"", offered via PM
* Mouse, Keyboard, etc: Offered via PM
* Speakers:  Dell AX210 speakers, offered via PM
* DVD Drive: none offered yet, but that's a detail, really.
* Case:  none offered yet, but also just a detail.
* PSU:  Thermaltake 550W, offered by Zodiii, but with the question of whether it will be enough.
* Reddit themed customization:  None offered so far, but not terribly important.

If there are any glaring technical issues or detail I should be concerned with, please let me know.
As it stands, I am happy with where this is going, so I say this thing is a GO.  I am going to bed for the evening and in the morning will try to re-educate myself on PC hardware and research this stuff.  I will be in touch tomorrow via PM with my address and to arrange to cover your shipping costs for those components that make up the final build. 

Thank you for being so generous!  I can't tell you enough how much I appreciate this.

**UPDATE [12/29/10 9:08PM Central]:**  As far as the build goes, everything is as it was in the previous update.  Those of you who who offered to contribute should have a message from me.  If I didn't make it clear, I will pay all your costs to get that stuff to me, so feel free to include incidentals like packaging.  You guys are helping me out a ton, so it's the least I can do.

Another big thank you to the folks listed up above, and thank you also to those who offered words of support.

Economics,"r/economics, How would an economic doomsday Sino-American relationship meltdown unfold?","Everyday I commute on my way to work and I see the most foreboding  sight ever: Cranes. Huge massive cranes unloading new goods from across the seas right next to my adoptive home of San-Francisco. We've all heard about debt relations between China and the USA: How China both sales the U.S. its manufactured goods and then reinvests its capital in the U.S. 

With Chinese personal savings rate near 50% and American savings rate being non-existent, it's easy to see that the Chinese aren't consuming the products made in their local market and are instead focusing on bolstering the economy of the USA. Peter Schiff says it best when he talks about a day when Chinese will just turn back the freighters hauling goods to the U.S. and refocus their capital on internal consumption.  

John Ralston Saul has a great sound-byte when he says that The West doesn't really want globalization. We want free trade with other western countries that have somewhat similar prices. Otherwise we wouldn't yell ""Predatory Pricing"" whenever a country that has a tenth of the wage cost we do tries to sell something here. If we really wanted globalization we wouldn't try to force China to change it's monetary policy. **Recently we've forced the Chinese to put tariffs on themselves under the threat that we'll do that for them if we have to. **

**tl;dr:** Which brings me to my question, Isn't encouraging China to place export tariffs a terrible idea? The Chinese government can't physically ""turn back the boats"" using policy initiatives, but an internal exports tax is exactly the way they'd incentivize refocusing Chinese capital on internal investment and consumption. If we were ever to see a non-gradual meltdown of Sino-American economic relationship, wouldn't Chinese export tariffs inevitably play a role in that? It seems to me that encouraging the Chinese to have export tariffs is diametrically opposed to what the situation calls for.",finance,2010-12-29,-0.0279938910753217

*Note: the minimum Canadian rate is 13%, which, when compared with the US fixed rate of 39%, suggests that Canada's economy is much friendlier to smaller businesses and less likely to produce uncontested corporate giants.

----------------------------------------------

It's widely available information. There's a little more at the [source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_rates_around_the_world). This shows Norway's sales tax to be a bit higher than US/Canadian on most things and Canadian payroll tax to be about 6 - 8% less than the US/Norwegian rate of approximately 15%.

[This source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_tax_revenue_as_percentage_of_GDP) does show that tax revenue in the US  constitutes a slightly smaller percentage of GDP (28.2%) than in Canada (33.4) and significantly smaller than in Norway (43.2%). The fact is, though, that the US does *not* have drastically lower taxes than other countries traditionally considered to have high tax rates; however, the other countries do live up to their reputations for above average social services. Also, Norway in particular is [rated extremely highly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index) by the HDI (Human Development Index) and Canada generally does better than the US (in this year's report, they fall short of the United States in the main report but still surpass it when adjusted for class inequality).

So how does the US not have the money for Norwegian/Canadian level social services even if the three countries have comparable tax rates? One of the main causes is probably the high military budget; in 2009, military expenditures amounted to 663 billion USD. That's about equal to the budgets of the next seventeen countries on the list *combined*. ([Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_military_expenditures).) 

Even more disconcerting, however, is the unbelievably large amount of money the US spends on healthcare with lackluster results. Not only is our healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP (16%) vastly higher than any other country (the next highest is 11%), so is the amount spent per capita (7290 USD). Norway, on the other hand, spends 8.9% of their GDP on healthcare and 4763 USD per capita, yet every single Norwegian is fully insured by the country's single payer system. At less cost to them than the US system that leaves 50 million of its 310 million citizens uninsured. ([Expenditures source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_total_health_expenditure_%28PPP%29_per_capita), [Norwegian healthcare source](http://healthcare-economist.com/2008/04/18/health-care-around-the-world-norway/), [United States healthcare source](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/27/uninsured-americans-50-million_n_801695.html))

So as you can see, living in the US you pay only slightly less money to the government than if you were living in Canada, and not a significant amount less than if you were living in Norway, but the only thing you get for it is war and inefficiency. This is not a rant based poorly recalled statistics; this is irrefutable proof based in hard numbers with strong supporting information. If anyone can find a flaw in my analysis, please let me know and I'll rectify it.

My favorite way to calculate this is using the potential money production of the time. If these were American minimum wage earners at the Federal rate of $7.25, that equates to $4,350,000,000 - four point three trillion dollars.

That would rank the hypothetical production power of Black Ops players ONLY at minimum wage at 143rd out of all countries as assessed by the World Bank, above 42 countries, and they've only been playing for 51 days, not a year. If you take that out to a year, they're ranked 82nd, with a GDP of $31,132,352,941.

The earnings they've made in 51 days is 0.03% of the U.S. National Debt. At that rate, they wouldn't even offset the debt, which has accrued, on average, $209,100,000,000 in that same time period.",technology,2010-12-30,-0.0089079288637355
